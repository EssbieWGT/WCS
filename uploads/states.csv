,Mississippi Today,2025-11-06 22:58:43+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Lawmakers explore cash assistance for new moms, no strings attached",Laura Santhanam and Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/06/lawmakers-explore-cash-assistance-for-new-moms-no-strings-attached/,The program Rx Kids has helped alleviate some of those crushing costs for young families in Michigan. Doctors in Mississippi are encouraged by how this program has boosted the quality of life for young patients and caregivers.,"What would happen if every mother in Mississippi – or in Mississippi’s neediest counties – received no-questions-asked cash assistance during pregnancy and months after a baby is born? Lawmakers pondered these questions at the state Capitol Thursday. 
The conversation focused on a program called Rx Kids, that started in Flint, Michigan, and is branded as a “prescription to poverty.” Dr. Mona Hanna, the program’s founder, presented her initiative to Mississippi lawmakers in House and Senate Public Health committees as a way to combat infant mortality. Nationwide, infants die at a higher rate in Mississippi than any other state. 
Mississippi doctors offered context during the hearing on rising infant deaths. In August, the state health department declared a public health emergency, and this week, doctors urged lawmakers to think creatively in how they choose to address the crisis. 
“Every hour that goes by, every day that goes by when a baby is born without the resources they need is a failure on all of us – we can do better,” Hanna said. “We don’t have to be OK with babies dying because of deprivation. This is not a genius idea, it’s not a new idea, it’s not a radical idea – this is just common sense.”
Rx Kids gives $1,500 to moms during pregnancy and $500 a month for six to 12 months after birth. This program only applies to mothers in the perinatal window in select communities, unlike a universal basic income, which would be available to everyone in theory. However, it is similarly unconditional – requiring no proof of income or employment and making no stipulations about how the money is spent. In Michigan, the program has given over $17 million to nearly 4,000 families in 11 communities to date – and the preliminary data bodes well.
Rx Kids is administered by GiveDirectly, a global cash assistance program funded by a number of private foundations and government institutions. At one point, this list included the U.S. Agency for International Development. 
Senate Public Health Committee Chairman Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory, said the program showed “great promise,” and House Public Health Committee Chairman Sam Creekmore, a Republican from New Albany, said he intends to “float the idea out to the Legislature.”
“My initial thoughts are that it’s great,” Creekmore said. “It comes down to can we afford it, or can we not afford it – but we can’t ignore it. It’s proven, successful and something I wanted to bring to the table today.”
Cash assistance programs similar to what Hanna described have demonstrated usefulness and public appeal. During the pandemic, the nation briefly had a cash assistance program for parents through the expanded child tax credit. The program helped reduce childhood poverty to a record low of 5%. After members of Congress failed to extend the program, childhood poverty has surged to a new high of 12%. Had Congress voted to continue the program in 2022, an analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found 3 million children could have been kept from poverty.
The U.S. is exceptional among wealthy nations for its high rate of childhood poverty. Evidence shows that when children endure poverty, they also are at greater risk of experiencing emotional dysregulation, obesity and malnutrition. These conditions are significant contributing factors to developing chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. In Mississippi, one of the poorest states in the nation, nearly 1 in 4 children live in poverty. 
Around childbirth, expenses increase while income decreases for parents, making it a uniquely difficult time. The United States offers no national paid parental leave policies but produces the highest costs in child care globally, according to the World Economic Forum. 
The program Rx Kids has helped alleviate some of those crushing costs for young families in Michigan. The number of infants staying in the neonatal intensive care unit, as well as those born underweight, dropped by more than a quarter, while preterm birth dropped by 18%, according to a study conducted on the program in Flint. In addition, evictions fell by 91%, and postpartum depression and nutritional access improved by 14%. 
Mississippi doctors are encouraged by these data and how a program like what Hanna has launched could boost quality of life for young patients and caregivers. Dr. Patricia Tibbs, a Laurel pediatrician and president of the Mississippi Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said she is sold on the program, calling the premise and the results so far “amazing.” 
“It seems like it shouldn’t work, but it works,” Tibbs told Mississippi Today. “There’s something that happens when a child is not born into absolute poverty, when that first year or two years of that child’s life is stress-free. It makes a huge difference in this child’s trajectory in the future.”
Given her understanding of child development and psychology, Tibbs believes even a temporary alleviation of poverty is worth it, because of the dramatic long-term effects that it can have on health and wellbeing. 
“The security of a check for a few months is enough to make you realize the possibilities,” Tibbs said.
Dr. Anita Henderson, a pediatrician in Hattiesburg and former president of the Mississippi Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said this program would help many of the patients she sees. 
“Transportation is an issue, child care is an issue, missing half a day at work is financially not feasible for many of my families,” Henderson said. 
During the hearing, Rep. Dan Eubanks, a Republican from Walls, raised concerns about the “lack of accountability” in the program. 
“If we’re trying to incentivize better behaviors, but we’re just giving them money, how does that incentivize them to correct some of the underlying causes of infant mortality?” Eubanks asked. 
Hanna said research shows the program led to an 11% decrease in smoking in the third trimester – something she attributes in part to a reduction in stress. 
“We didn’t create a complicated program to tell people to stop smoking – but people are on their own,” Hanna said. “Because moms by and large know what they need to do. They know what’s important, everybody loves their babies, and they want healthy babies. If you just give them a little bit of an economic cushion during this window, we see all these improvements.”
A letter from Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to new babies, included in a care package Rx Kids sends out to all families in Rx Kids communities.
In Michigan, the absence of bureaucratic and systemic barriers allowed the program to garner bipartisan support. Michigan Sen. John Damoose, a Republican who represents a rural swathe of northern Michigan, recalled going from a skeptic to a champion of the program. 
“My immediate first thought was, ‘I’m a Republican – we don’t support giving away free money,’” Damoose told Mississippi Today. “But, as a pro-life Republican, I did wonder whether this program might give some young mothers the courage they need to choose life, so I decided to dig a little deeper. What I found was a brilliantly crafted initiative that was totally efficient and through its simplicity, addressed some of the most critical needs facing young families and children throughout our society.”
Damoose said he found the economics of the program compelling, since it “avoids the massive costs of bureaucracy.”
The program has almost no overhead. Once the money is allocated, there is very little that states have to do to administer it. Hanna estimated a pilot program in two Mississippi counties would likely require two staff members on the ground. 
“We are not hiring offices of people to figure out who’s in, who’s out, who’s deserving, who’s not deserving,” Hanna explained. “Plus, everybody needs help during this window. That’s why this program is more focused on poor places, rather than poor people.”
In Michigan, the program is made possible through a combination of state funds, federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds, and philanthropic funds. 
Mark Jones, director of communications at the Mississippi Department of Human Services – which oversees the TANF program – said they have not allocated any money toward the program and won’t know whether they have the funding to do so until early 2026. 
“We have been approached by those who have operated the program in other states and are always open to hearing solutions that would benefit Mississippians,” Jones said. 
A private foundation called The Families and Workers Fund, headquartered in New York, has already pledged $2 million to implement the program in Mississippi – contingent on the state putting up funds, Hanna said. The state’s funds don’t have to be TANF funds, and they don’t have to be a direct match – it could be less than $1 million. 
“About $2.5 million is needed to start a pilot program, and we have $2 million,” Hanna said. 
The use of philanthropic funds means the assistance counts as a gift, rather than income. That saves people from falling off “the benefits cliff,” a phenomenon where needy families who see a small increase in income get kicked off of social safety net programs, such as Medicaid or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
This kind of direct investment in families influences outcomes beyond poverty or infant mortality, Hanna said. It bolsters community and strengthens public trust in government. 
“As much as we are eliminating poverty and improving health, we are sending a message,” Hanna said. “This is all very much about shifting the narrative about how we can care for each other. We are literally telling people: ‘We love you, we are investing in you, and we cannot wait to see what you become.’”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/06142416/Infant-mortality-hearing-1.jpg,,,2025-11-06 18:01:39.496617

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)UNDERWOOD, N.D. — WBI Energy on Thursday released new details of the timeline for the planned Bakken East natural gas pipeline connecting the two halves of North Dakota. 
The development will kick into high gear in 2026, a company representative said during a meeting of the Legislature’s Energy Development and Transmission Committee. 
WBI will hold a binding open season during the first quarter when shippers will commit to ship natural gas on the pipeline. Then WBI expects to sign agreements with gas customers along its planned route by the midpoint of the year. 
“We feel good about where we are today based on our ongoing conversations with a host of potential customers,” said Mark Anderson, vice president of business development and marketing for WBI. The potential customers include utilities, industrial users, and others such as data center developers. 
WBI will apply for federal regulatory approval between July and September 2026, Anderson said. The company is optimistic the regulatory process will go smoothly. 
“We feel tail winds at the federal level at the moment, which gives us some comfort that our schedule is manageable and predictable,” Anderson told lawmakers during the meeting at Coal Creek Station power plant. “We would look to get our first certificate in early 2028.”
WBI to receive $500M state financial guarantee to build natural gas pipeline in North Dakota

WBI is planning to begin construction of the pipeline in the second half of 2028. Phase one, from McKenzie County to Washburn, is expected to be in service by the end of 2029. The second phase of construction, from Washburn to Mapleton near Fargo, is slated to be completed by the end of 2030. 
The pipeline is expected to transport up to 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas out of the Bakken per day. WBI also plans to construct “laterals,” extending away from the main route, to serve communities like Ellendale, the site of a large data center. 
The North Dakota Industrial Commission approved a $500 million financial guarantee earlier this year to help get the project off the ground. This deal, Anderson said Thursday, is “in progress” and has not been finalized. 
The financial guarantee represents $50 million worth of shipping capacity per year, over 10 years. Justin Kringstad, director of the North Dakota Pipeline Authority, said that represents between 15% and 17% of the pipeline’s total capacity. The state plans to transfer that pipeline capacity to private businesses.
Anderson said WBI views the financial backstop as a “bridge” between the pipeline’s construction and the demand from potential customers. 
2 natural gas pipelines compete for $500M financial backstop from North Dakota

WBI has not finalized the design of the pipeline, nor secured easements from landowners for the planned route. The company has received permission to survey the route from 98% of landowners along the 350-mile mainline, 93% of landowners along a potential lateral to Spiritwood, the site of a large industrial park, and 53% of a possible lateral to Ellendale. 
The pipeline will tie into WBI’s broader network of pipelines in North Dakota and other states. Even though the new pipeline will begin in McKenzie County, the company’s pipeline network connects to the majority of natural gas processing plants in northwest North Dakota, Anderson said. 
Anderson said WBI’s goal is to enable community growth and economic development across the state by providing access to natural gas for power generation. 
“All signs point to Bakken production continuing to grow. We want to do our part to ensure that Bakken production, gas production can access markets safely, reliably in support of the crude oil production,” Anderson said.

June Robinson, D-Everett, seen here in 2023, chairs the Senate Ways & Means Committee and is the lead budget writer for the majority Democratic caucus in the Washington Legislature. (Legislative Support Services)With the state strapped for cash, Democrats’ chief budget writer in the Washington Senate has told colleagues there’s no money available for new spending they might desire next year.
Don’t even bother asking, Sen. June Robinson, chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, warned fellow lawmakers in an email Tuesday.
“I will not be soliciting or accepting any member requests for the operating budget in the upcoming session,” she wrote. “Please help set expectations around this with your constituents and advocates as you meet with them.”
Early each session, lawmakers typically submit requests to budget writers for new or additional funding for programs and services. Wish lists are the product of legislators’ conversations with a wide berth of individuals and interests.
Robinson, an Everett Democrat, said in an interview Wednesday she reached out before any submissions arrived in hopes of tamping down expectations. 
“We don’t have money to pay for what is needed, let alone new spending that members might request,” she said. 
Recent economic forecasts show a steep decline in tax receipts in Washington, sending the two-year state budget spiraling toward a deficit. This is in spite of billions of dollars in new and higher taxes approved earlier this year by the Democratic-controlled Legislature and Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson.
Robinson shared her email with Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, the lead Republican on the budget writing committee. Gildon, in turn, forwarded it to members of his caucus Wednesday evening.
“I thought she did a good job in making clear that the budget is not in good shape,” he said. “It was a wise move to set expectations, not just among legislators but among all the interest groups who might be planning to come forward with requests.”
Rep. Timm Ormsby, D-Spokane, chair of the House Appropriations Committee and Robinson’s budget-writing counterpart, said Wednesday he’s not sent any emails but tries to deliver a similar message when meeting with those in his caucus.
“We have in the past explained that we are in really tight times and are really discouraging member requests,” he said.
The operating budget Ferguson signed in May calls for $77.8 billion in spending over two years across government, including public schools and colleges, health care, social services, housing, corrections, and environmental protection. It also funds new two-year collective bargaining agreements with most, but not all, public employee unions.
It relied on about $4 billion from new and higher taxes and transfers from other accounts into the general fund, the central pot of money used to pay for most state spending. It projected the state would end the fiscal cycle with $225 million in cash reserves and $2 billion in its emergency, or rainy day, fund. 
That picture is evolving. The September forecast showed revenue fueling this budget will be $74.3 billion, including new and higher taxes that legislators and Ferguson approved.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Federal cuts, tariffs and the economic effects of the ongoing government shutdown further complicate the ledger as Ferguson and legislators prepare to make changes to the current budget in the 2026 session.
Ferguson will get the ball rolling with his proposal due in December. It will serve as a template for lawmakers in the 60-day session that begins Jan. 12.
“It’s really bad,” Robinson said. “I don’t walk around with a number in my head. It’s billions and it’s going to require cuts.”
If the fiscal challenge doesn’t deter a lawmaker from making a funding request, the prospect of a gubernatorial veto might.

WILMINGTON, Del. — Kurt Foreman, president and CEO of Delaware Prosperity Partnership, will step down at the end of November to become president of Ithaca Area Economic Development in upstate New York, closing out a tenure in which he helped solidify Delaware’s public-private model as a competitive force in business recruitment.
Foreman will take the helm of Ithaca Area Economic Development (IAED) in January 2026 following a national search. In his new role, he will lead business attraction, retention, and expansion efforts for Ithaca and Tompkins County, a region anchored by Cornell University and known for research, clean energy, technology, and advanced manufacturing. He will be responsible for setting IAED’s long-term strategy, guiding major capital and redevelopment projects, supporting existing employers, recruiting new companies and strengthening collaborations among higher education, local governments, workforce partners and private investors.
IAED board leaders have framed Foreman’s appointment as a move to position the region to compete more aggressively for high-quality jobs and innovation-driven investment. They point to his more than 30 years in economic development across several states, his experience working directly with site selectors and corporate decision-makers, and his record at Delaware Prosperity Partnership (DPP) as key factors in their decision.
Foreman has served as DPP’s president and CEO since 2018, following the organization’s creation in 2017 as Delaware’s statewide public-private economic development agency. Under his leadership, DPP reports that it has helped attract or support projects representing more than $3.5 billion in capital investment and thousands of jobs, while marketing Delaware as a nimble, business-friendly location and building stronger ties with employers and investors.
No announcement has been made about Foreman’s successor.
DPP board members and investors are scheduled to gather for their annual meeting Nov. 17 at CSC Station in Wilmington, where the leadership transition and the organization’s next phase are expected to be central topics of discussion. While DPP’s formal mission remains business recruitment, retention and expansion, many observers will be watching to see whether Gov. Matt Meyer and the board move to place greater emphasis on startup support and innovation-focused ventures as they shape the organization’s future direction.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/foreman-leaving.png,,,2025-11-06 18:01:39.496617

The ruling by U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell Jr. gave President Donald Trump’s administration until Friday to make the payments through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, though it’s unlikely the 42 million Americans — about 1 in 8, most of them in poverty — will see the money on the debit cards they use for groceries nearly that quickly.
The order was in response to a challenge from cities and nonprofits complaining that the administration was only offering to cover 65% of the maximum benefit, a decision that would have left some recipients getting nothing for this month.
“The defendants failed to consider the practical consequences associated with this decision to only partially fund SNAP,” McConnell said in a ruling from the bench after a brief hearing. “They knew that there would be a long delay in paying partial SNAP payments and failed to consider the harms individuals who rely on those benefits would suffer.”
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
McConnell was one of two judges who ruled last week that the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely because of the federal shutdown.
The Trump administration chose partial payments this week
Last month, the administration said that it would halt SNAP payments for November if the government shutdown wasn’t resolved.
A coalition of cities and nonprofits sued in federal court in Rhode Island and Democratic state officials from across the country did so in Massachusetts.
The judges in both cases ordered the government to use one emergency reserve fund containing more than $4.6 billion to pay for SNAP for November but gave it leeway to tap other money to make the full payments, which cost between $8.5 billion and $9 billion each month.
On Monday, the administration said it would not use additional money, saying it was up to Congress to appropriate the funds for the program and that the other money was needed to shore up other child hunger programs.
The partial funding brought on complications
McConnell harshly criticized the Trump administration for making that choice.
“Without SNAP funding for the month of November, 16 million children are immediately at risk of going hungry,” he said. “This should never happen in America. In fact, it’s likely that SNAP recipients are hungry as we sit here.”
Tyler Becker, the attorney for the government, unsuccessfully argued that the Trump administration had followed the court’s order in issuing the partial payments. “This all comes down to Congress not having appropriated funds because of the government shutdown,” he said.
Kristin Bateman, a lawyer for the coalition of cities and nonprofit organizations, told the judge the administration had other reasons for not fully funding the benefits.
“What defendants are really trying to do is to leverage people’s hunger to gain partisan political advantage in the shutdown fight,” Bateman told the court.
McConnell said last week’s order required that those payments be made “expeditiously” and “efficiently” — and by Wednesday — or a full payment would be required. “Nothing was done consistent with the court’s order to clear the way to expeditiously resolve it,” McConnell said.
There were other twists and turns this week
The administration said in a court filing on Monday that it could take weeks or even months for some states to make calculations and system changes to load the debit cards used in the SNAP program. At the time, it said it would fund 50% of the maximum benefits.
The next day, Trump appeared to threaten not to pay the benefits at all unless Democrats in Congress agreed to reopen the government. His press secretary later said that the partial benefits were being paid for November — and that it is future payments that are at risk if the shutdown continues.
And Wednesday night, it recalculated, telling states that there was enough money to pay for 65% of the maximum benefits.
Under a decades-old formula in federal regulations, everyone who received less than the maximum benefit would get a larger percentage reduction. Some families would have received nothing and some single people and two-person households could have gotten as little as $16.
Carmel Scaife, a former day care owner in Milwaukee who hasn’t been able to work since receiving multiple severe injuries in a car accident seven years ago, said she normally receives $130 a month from SNAP. She said that despite bargain hunting, that is not nearly enough for a month’s worth of groceries.
Scaife, 56, said that any cuts to her benefit will mean she will need to further tap her Social Security income for groceries. “That’ll take away from the bills that I pay,” she said. “But that’s the only way I can survive.”
The next legal step is unclear
This type of order is usually not subject to an appeal, but the Trump administration has challenged other rulings like it before.
An organization whose lawyers filed the challenge signaled it would continue the battle if needed.
“We shouldn’t have to force the President to care for his citizens,” Democracy Forward President and CEO Skye Perryman said in a statement, “but we will do whatever is necessary to protect people and communities.”
It often takes SNAP benefits a week or more to be loaded onto debit cards once states initiate the process.

May 13, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen is “not into the mood of negotiation” for a tobacco tax compact with the Omaha Tribe of Nebraska, coming as the tribe moves forward with medical cannabis and, eventually, recreational marijuana.
The comments came at an unrelated news conference Thursday where Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, whom Pillen had appointed to negotiate a contract, also addressed the Omaha Tribe’s marijuana law and a tobacco tax compact. Pillen’s main opposition is the potential that the tribe pursues recreational marijuana after fully implementing medical cannabis.
“My view is really simple: There’s not going to be Nebraskans going into the Omaha Tribe and buying recreational marijuana,” Pillen said. “We’ll take whatever steps it is to keep our state in the values and keep that from happening.”

Asked how that would happen, Pillen directed questions to Hilgers but said the pair had some “early conversations” about dealing with the possible expansion to recreational marijuana on tribal lands. Pillen said he isn’t into “speculation.” Pillen did not say whether he wanted the state to prevent medical cannabis sales to Nebraska residents.
“When that time comes, we’ll figure out the right way and obviously make sure we’re doing it legally as well,” Pillen said of recreational marijuana.
Omaha Tribe Attorney General Cartier has alleged that in light of the tribal law on marijuana, Hilgers’ office shut down tax compact negotiations in “direct retaliation.”
‘We will defend our sovereignty’
In a Thursday statement, Carter said the state can’t dictate internal licensing on tribal lands and that the tribe would continue to work in “good faith” to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
“But we caution him [Pillen]: if he is relying solely on the attorney general’s flawed interpretation of the law, personal crusades are clouding his legal judgment as they have before,” Cartier said. “If the state continues to retaliate or attempts to block our lawful enterprise, we will defend our sovereignty through all available means.”

In July, the Omaha Tribe Council unanimously approved a law legalizing medical cannabis and adult-use recreational marijuana. Also this summer, the tribe reached out to Pillen to begin discussions on a tobacco tax compact. The state has one with the Santee Sioux Nation.
In short, such a compact would allow the Omaha Tribe to access hundreds of thousands of dollars in tobacco tax revenue currently all going to Nebraska. The Omaha Tribe has asked for 90% of taxes while also taking on some state regulatory duties to track tobacco sales and save the state money. The Santee Sioux have an agreement to retain 75%.
Cartier said that if Pillen prefers a 75-25 split similar to the Santee Sioux, the Omaha Tribe is prepared to accept that structure, which he said was already offered before. Another possible consideration could be the state budget, which already faces a significant projected deficit.
‘Poison’
Hilgers on Thursday and earlier this week said the state doesn’t have to enter into a compact with the Omaha Tribe. He described the agreement as an “arm’s length transaction” that would need to be “good for both sides” to be finalized.
One of the first things Hilgers learned as a “baby lawyer,” he said, was not to talk about private conversations or risk losing his credibility. He said he didn’t want to negotiate through the media and detested the negotiation tactics he felt Cartier and the Omaha Tribe were using.

Cartier previously said the Omaha Tribe was speaking out because the tribe wants to remain in the “driver’s seat” on an issue that could lead to economic development and workforce gains. The tribe also is focused on public health compliance and product testing, Cartier said.
“The people of Nebraska and the Omaha Tribe deserve decisions grounded in the actual law, not partisan or personal crusades,” Cartier said.
Hilgers said the deal he sees is of no benefit to Nebraska and that the real proposal before Nebraska is to accept what he called an “unlawful” medical and recreational marijuana “scheme.”
“We’re going to violate your law,” Hilgers said of the tribe’s position. “We’re going to sell a poison, contrary to your law, to your citizens. You’re going to have to deal with the fallout in the State of Nebraska.”
Tribal sovereignty
On Wednesday, Hilgers said that even if medical marijuana is available in Nebraska, it doesn’t mean “some dispensary in Alliance can just whip up a dispensary and just start selling.” Alliance, a city 334 miles west of the Omaha Tribe, is not a sovereign nation like the Omaha Tribe.

Hilgers said the Omaha Tribe was looking to “flaunt” or “thumb” its nose at Nebraska laws and “make life more difficult” in the Cornhusker State. He said he worried about “mental health fallout” from expanded marijuana and said a main concern is sales to nontribal citizens.
“If you are not a licensed dispensary or cultivator, you cannot operate in the medical marijuana world under current state statute,” Hilgers said.
Pillen and Hilgers have taken subtle differences in their approaches to medical cannabis, with Pillen providing some administrative support to the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission if it sticks to medical cannabis. Hilgers’ office had said it would sue the commission if it issued licenses. 
Though two cultivators were licensed last month, that lawsuit threat hasn’t yet materialized. At the news conferences, Pillen focused on recreational marijuana worries, while Hilgers spoke more broadly.
‘At their own peril’
Voter-passed state law allows patients to possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis in any form or THC level with any health care practitioner’s recommendation.
A second law leaves the regulation of “registered cannabis establishments” in the state to the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission. No transporters, product manufacturers or dispensaries are yet licensed.

The tribe seeks to operate on tribal lands, and tribal leaders have been cautious that whatever actions they pursue, they know Hilgers is watching. Cartier has said tobacco and marijuana are separate issues.
Nebraska voters overwhelmingly legalized medical cannabis in Nebraska and set up a regulatory system one year ago this week. It’s a decision Hilgers has openly opposed and said his office will seek to overturn. 
The AG has repeatedly argued Nebraska’s cannabis laws violate federal law, even as dozens of other states have medical cannabis programs on the books. 
The federal government has not challenged Nebraska’s laws, and Congress has repeatedly barred the U.S. Department of Justice from interfering with state medical cannabis laws.
Some Nebraskans hoping to get medical cannabis have looked to the Omaha Tribe as an escape valve and told the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission as much this week. 
Hilgers did not respond to a question Thursday of whether there was a difference between Nebraskans who ultimately go to the Omaha Tribe for medicine or are currently going to surrounding states for medical cannabis, including Colorado, South Dakota or Missouri.
Hilgers said anyone who goes to the tribe to buy marijuana will do so “at their own peril, and I would highly discourage them from doing that.”

(Photo: HUgh Jackson/Nevada Current)NV Energy estimates it overcharged customers at both ends of the state by a total of $65.4 million from 2002 through 2024, the company reported in response to an investigation by the Nevada Public Utilities Commission.
The utility initially acknowledged overcharging some 60,000 customers by roughly $17 million, the Current reported in May, but the utility later found through an audit it had overcharged another 20,000  “previously unidentified ‘multi-family accounts’ for an undisclosed amount.” 
NV Energy overcharges at least 80,000 customers, scrimps on refunds

It’s unknown how much of the money has been paid back. NV Energy first attempted to reimburse a portion of customers a total of $2.5 million, based on what PUC staff alleged was an inapplicable rule limiting reimbursement of overcharges to six months. 
A law passed by the Legislature this year in response to NV Energy’s failure to make customers whole requires that utilities pay back all overcharges with interest. Active customers will get a credit to their bills, while previous customers will receive a refund, according to the law. 
The overcharging began in 2002 when the company began to charge different electricity rates to single-family residential customers than those in multi-family units. The overcharges were primarily assessed to ratepayers in multi-family developments who were misclassified and charged the higher, single-family rate.  
The commission, as part of its investigation, ordered the utility to estimate the total dollar amount of overcharges to customers, including tax and other charges, between 2001 and 2025.  
From 2002 through 2017, NV Energy overcharged customers in Southern Nevada by $27.4 million, and overcharged ratepayers in Northern Nevada by $17.7 million, the utility said Wednesday in its response to the PUC. 
The estimates were determined by using the average amount of electricity from the date the units were misclassified, without any deduction for disconnections or vacancies, NV Energy wrote in a response filed Wednesday. 
“As a result, the estimate likely overstates the actual amount of overcharges that occurred,” the company wrote Wednesday.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/clarkstncropped-1024x620.jpg,,,2025-11-06 18:01:39.496617

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Polk County pledged Thursday to allocate $1 million to local food organizations during the lapse in funding for federal nutrition programs.
Due to a lawsuit, the federal government is set to partially fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the shutdown, but experts say the rollout of these partial payments could take weeks. 
Polk County Supervisor Matt McCoy said Thursday that SNAP recipients don’t know when that money will show up in their accounts. 
“Because this is fluid, and because people are concerned about where their food will come from, they’re hitting the food banks now,” McCoy said.
“We hope (the administration) will fund this program, but until that happens, we need an immediate infusion of cash. And the check is cut from Polk County, and it will go out the door immediately.”
Kathy Underhill, the CEO of Des Moines Area Religious Council or DMARC, said Polk County is “living up” to its tagline: “leading the way.” 
“I know that all of our partners in the DMARC network are seeing increased need; in fact Monday, we broke our 50-year record, Tuesday, we broke that record,” Underhill said. 
As visitors wait in lines, or in the waiting room to visit the pantry, Underhill said staff are able to tell them: “We will have food for you, do not worry. Be patient, there is food.” 
“And Polk County is ensuring that we can keep saying that, and we’re just so grateful,” Underhill said.

Polk County’s funds
The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously on the $1 million allocation during a special session meeting Thursday. 
The majority, $750,000, will go to Food Bank of Iowa, which serves 55 Iowa counties. DMARC, Polk County’s largest food pantry, will receive $230,000 and Caring Hands, a community organization with a food pantry in Altoona, will receive the remaining $20,000. 
McCoy said the $1 million came from “interest earning” dollars the county had that were not allocated to a budget. McCoy said the county also budgets $5 million annually to support county-run food pantries, a commodity supplement food program, community meals and home delivered meals for seniors and qualifying adults. 
Tami Nielsen, president and CEO of the Food Bank of Iowa, said the food bank serves more than 200 partners in Polk County alone, and that during “regular times” the food bank delivers four full trucks of food, five days a week, to these partners. 


Food security vocabulary:
Food bank: A broader coalition that transports large quantities of food within a given region. There are six food banks serving Iowa.
Food pantry: The drive-by windows, charitable closets,  free grocery store setups and the like that serve individuals experiencing hunger.
SNAP eligibility: The gross income limit for SNAP eligibility in Iowa is 160% of the federal poverty level, which is $25,040 for a single individual or $51,440 for a family of four.


“Now, our partners are seeing some community members visit them for the very first time, people who have never before visited a pantry and are understandably worried about how to keep food on the table,” Nielsen said. 
In addition to new visitors, she said food pantries and feeding centers have noted an increased frequency from some visitors, because the “hard times just got harder.” 
According to McCoy, the county’s allocation will be enough to purchase roughly 473,000 pounds of food for the county. Nielsen said the Food Bank of Iowa serves nearly a million pounds of food on average each month to Polk County partners. 
“This extra million dollars going into Polk County is — we are so grateful for it, because the need has skyrocketed,” Nielsen said. 
The $1 million from the county is earmarked specifically for food procurement at the receiving organizations.
While the board voted unanimously to pass the measure, Supervisor Angela Connolly first proposed an amendment to make the allocation $1.5 million instead. Connolly said the additional half a million dollars would help to cover some of the administration costs the organizations face, like increased staffing and drivers. 
“It costs money to ramp up,” Connolly said. “They’re all, I’m sure, grateful for what we’re doing, but they are under the gun getting this food out as quickly as possible.” 
The amendment failed 2-3 with Connolly and Tom Hockensmith voting for the measure. 
McCoy said the board will meet again in two weeks “to evaluate where we are” and can decide then if another $500,000 is necessary. 
Nielsen said the food bank has operational costs of $0.32 per pound of food delivered. She said there will be costs associated with the distribution of additional food that the bank will “have to absorb.”
Iowa receives roughly $45 million in SNAP benefits each month to serve the nearly 270,000 enrolled individuals in the state. Polk County has close to 50,000 SNAP recipients each month.
Gov. Kim Reynolds dedicated $1 million in state funds to match monetary donations made at Iowa food banks. The $1 million match was spread among Iowa’s six food banks depending on the number of SNAP recipients in the food banks’ areas. 
McCoy said the suspension of SNAP funds is an “extraordinary time.” 
“Exceptional times call for exceptions to policies and finding dollars that are available,” McCoy said. “We would encourage all the partners in government at the state and local level to do what they can to step up.” 
Recipients set to receive about 65% of max benefits
On Monday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said recipients would receive 50% of SNAP benefits for the month, as a result of a lawsuit from cities and nonprofits against the Trump administration. The same coalition of cities and nonprofits that sued USDA to release the funds, said the 50% calculation was incorrect. 
The department’s initial calculation would have spent $3 billion from a USDA contingency fund, but the court required the department to spend all $4.65 billion from the fund. 
USDA department officials responded to the error in the court filings Wednesday and said instead that maximum SNAP allotments for November would be 65% of typical maximum allotments. 
The partial distributions would be calculated by subtracting 30% of the recipient’s net income from 65% of their typical SNAP allocation. 
An analysis of USDA’s updated benefit allotment tables from the Iowa Hunger Coalition found that a family of five that typically receives $597 in SNAP benefits, would instead receive $183. Some households, the coalition said, would receive no allotment under the new guidelines.
Iowa Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment on the status or expected timeline of distributing benefits in the state. 
President Donald Trump posted on social media, following the initial order to partially fund SNAP, that the benefits would be “given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!” 
Citing the president’s post, U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. in Rhode Island, on Thursday, ordered the Trump administration to pay the full $9 billion in SNAP benefits for the month of November. The administration has not yet responded to the order.  
“Washington is broken, and when Washington is broken, we have to step up and do what we need to do at the local level,” McCoy said. “That’s what we’re doing today.”

Brandon Prichard, R-Bismarck, attends a special session of the Legislature on Oct. 23, 2023. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A former North Dakota lawmaker is seeking to overturn a state law that makes it a crime to lie or make intentionally misleading statements in political ads.
Brandon Prichard, who represented Bismarck in the Legislature in 2023 and 2024, on Tuesday filed a federal lawsuit challenging the state’s corrupt practices law, claiming that it violates the First Amendment.
The Republican is a controversial figure in North Dakota politics in part for his attacks on incumbent Republican lawmakers.
Prichard says he’s been subjected to multiple investigations under the law, which makes it a class A misdemeanor to knowingly or with “reckless disregard for its truth or falsity” publish something false or misleading about a candidate or ballot measure. 
He claims the investigations are baseless, but that they’ve caused him to self-censor for fear of further legal repercussions.
“I’m not opposed to there being some regulations on egregious political speech that defames people,” Prichard said in an interview Thursday with the North Dakota Monitor. “But what we have here is something that’s overly broad.”
Bill seeks to strengthen North Dakota law against false political ads

Prichard’s political action committee, Citizens Alliance of North Dakota, is also listed as a plaintiff in the case.
The lawsuit names Attorney General Drew Wrigley, Burleigh County State’s Attorney Julie Lawyer as well as the North Dakota Ethics Commission and its executive director, Rebecca Binstock, as defendants. 
In court documents, Prichard claims he and his wife, Kathryn Prichard, are under investigation by the Burleigh County State’s Attorney’s Office for alleged violations of the corrupt practices law. The lawsuit doesn’t contain specifics about what prompted the inquiry.
Prichard also references in the suit a cease and desist letter he received from an attorney for Rep. Jason Dockter, R-Bismarck. The letter claimed Citizens Alliance of North Dakota violated the corrupt practices statute by funding a billboard that said Dockter stole North Dakotans’ money, the lawsuit says.  
Prichard says the billboard was referencing the fact that in 2024, a Burleigh County jury convicted Dockter of a conflict-of-interest misdemeanor for voting on legislation that he had a financial interest in. Dockter was not charged with stealing money.
The lawsuit says Prichard has also had multiple North Dakota Ethics Commission complaints filed against him under the statute. That includes an active complaint filed against him in 2023 and two others filed against him and Citizens Alliance of North Dakota in 2024 that have since been dismissed, according to the complaint.
Prichard believes the 2023 complaint accuses him of lying about his residency and student status while serving as a state representative. The Ethics Commission keeps details about complaints confidential unless they’re found to be substantiated and the accused has a chance to appeal, so the content of the complaints cannot be corroborated.
Prichard caught criticism in 2023 after he publicly described himself as a law student at the University of Minnesota. Prichard was an undergraduate student at the university at the time, though not enrolled in the law school.
He also says that even though he was a University of Minnesota student, he still lived in his legislative district.
Prichard to decline recount, likely losing House seat

Prichard notes in the lawsuit that legislative candidate Duane Sand was accused of violating the corrupt practices statute in 2018. 
Burleigh County prosecutors charged Sand with publication of false information in political advertisements after opponent George Keiser filed a police report alleging Sand had misstated the incumbent’s voting record, The Bismarck Tribune reported.
Sand later made police reports accusing Keiser and others of breaking the same law. Prosecutors dropped the charge against Sand after all involved reached a private settlement and agreed to stop pursuing the complaints.
During the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers amended the corrupt practices law to include not only things like political mailers and billboards, but also statements made through phone calls, texts and social media.
Sen. Sean Cleary, a Bismarck Republican who was campaign manager for U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, introduced the amendment that added text messages and phone calls. On the day of the June 2024 primary, anonymous text messages falsely claimed that Fedorchak had dropped out of the five-way race.
Prichard testified during the session that the Legislature should repeal the law entirely or at least make it less restrictive.
He said that the proper way to deal with false political speech is to counter it with truthful speech.
“The other option is you’re going to use the forceful hand of the government to say what’s true and what’s not,” he told the Monitor.
Pat Finken, a retired North Dakota political consultant, said he supports the law. 
“I think that accountability in that way is necessary,” he said. “The bottom of that downward slide is a pretty ugly place if you can say anything you want without any kind of accountability.”
The lawsuit on Thursday was assigned to U.S. District Court Judge Dan Traynor.
The Attorney General’s Office on Thursday afternoon said it had not yet reviewed the complaint.
Binstock, the North Dakota Ethics Commission’s executive director, said to her knowledge the commission had not been served with the lawsuit and that the commission does not comment on pending litigation. 
The Burleigh County State’s Attorney’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“He calls himself a cultural documentarian. He says it a bit tongue-in-cheek, but that is really what he is,” said Rowell's friend Sara Tucker, who is publishing the career-spanning photo book locally.

This story by Isabel Dreher was first published in The Herald on Nov. 6, 2025.
Photographer Jack Rowell is on the verge of releasing his magnum opus — that’s what his publisher calls it, anyway, he said. The project is a 121-page book of photos, an epic of Rowell’s favorite images of his career.
“It gave me an opportunity to archive what I’ve done for the past 55 years, which I never would’ve done,” he said. “It’s my legacy, and I hope people like it.”
Sara Tucker, who owns a local book publishing company, Korongo Books, is publishing Rowell’s photography book. “He calls himself a cultural documentarian. He says it a bit tongue-in-cheek, but that is really what he is,” she said. “As a photographer, he has documented and preserved part of Vermont culture.”
Tucker and Rowell went to high school together and their professional relationship is built on decades of friendship. For Tucker, as a lover of stories, having a local publishing company is a way to share the important stories of Vermont. That, she says, is exactly what Rowell does.
“I think its important for individuals to give us their perspective on a given period of time and place,” she said. “His perspective on the 50 years that he’s been largely a documentary photographer is an important part of our story. So in sharing it, he’s sharing a part of our common heritage, and it’s important to capture that and preserve it.” Rowell speaks with a thoughtfulness gained by decades of observing people around him. It’s something he’s done through the lens and beyond, evidenced in his ability to share detailed stories of every face on the pages of his book.
The coffee table-style book, which will be released on November 22, has taken Rowell three years to compile. While he gives high praise and credit to his publisher and designer, much of the beginning of the process was undertaken alone as he went through decades upon decades of archived photos, including the thousands of rolls of film that dominated his career until the early 2000s.
One notable photo, unearthed from the depths, was one he called “Man on the Midway,” an image that Rowell took at the Tunbridge Fair in 1973. Centered in the frame is the figure of a man with one hand stuffed in the pocket of his large coat. A cigarette hangs lazily out of his mouth, in contrast with the intensity of his eyes, bordered by the lines etched in skin from the sun and smiles that are trademarks of the life of a hard-working Vermonter. A cap is pulled low on his forehead.
The photo’s publication potential though, was not always guaranteed. It suffered damage in its time as a negative that Rowell said he wouldn’t have been able to repair before Photoshop came along. “Somehow I knocked that negative onto the floor and stepped on it, and it had these huge gouges. I mean, the emulsion was literally gone. … It was just black,” he said.
“It’s a very powerful image,” Rowell said. “It was the last photo on the roll. … We used to hand roll our own film then, and where the film would stick out and you’d attach it to the cassette would get exposed, so it was white. You can almost see a little bit of that white there.” He ran his finger along the top of the photo.
One of the things that makes that image, and, in fact, many of Rowell’s photos, so striking, is the way he captures his subjects’ faces. “Remember,” he said, “the eyes are the key.”
Life with Fred
In the 1990s, Rowell became an associate producer on “Man With a Plan,” John O’Brien’s 1996 film about Fred Tuttle, the real-life Tunbridge farmer and his fictional run for U.S. Congress. Tuttle occupies his fair share of pages in Rowell’s book.
“This was before the movie came out,” he said, poring over one of the book’s final pages, an image of Fred Tuttle in front of the U.S. Capitol building, which ultimately became a movie poster for “Man With a Plan.”
“We went to D.C., and we did it just in time too, because they replaced parts of the dome after that, and the Capitol was shrouded. This was all scaffolding,” he pointed to the grand white dome behind Tuttle. “I posed Fred on a knoll in front of the Capitol, and I had some trouble dealing with light, because it was sunny out, but then it got a little overcast.”
After the release of the film, Tuttle did actually make a run for U.S. Congress during which Rowell continue to photograph him, including for People Magazine. Tuttle ended up endorsing incumbent Patrick Leahy and losing the race.
Shifting style
Rowell grew up in Groton, moving to Randolph by the time he started high school. He was a heavy drinker and smoker, but gave up both vices decades ago. 
Later in his career, Rowell began to focus more on studio photography. He has a small studio in Randolph, and the latter half of his book features many photos taken there or in other studios nearby. Rowell said his photos became more focused after he stopped drinking, and many of those shots represent that time.
However, Rowell has always stuck with a mantra about his favorite photographic subjects. “I just came up with this once when this artsy-fartsy type asked me. … My favorite things to photograph, that would have to be big fish and good looking women,” he said. 
When asked if that was really true or just something he likes to say, Rowell gave a shrug. “Its kinda true,” he answered with a laugh.
Bringing ‘Jack Rowell Photographs’ to life
The photos in the book span from 1973 to 2025. Some of his first-ever photos are featured, like one of a pair of laughing men perched on the back of a garbage truck, taken in Braintree when Rowell was 18. The most recent photo in the book was taken in May of this year, and features Mary Frances Leahy playing fiddle at at the Chandler Music Hall. The 19-year-old daughter of Celtic fiddler extraordinaire Natalie MacMaster (whom Rowell has photographed many times and who is also featured in the book), Leahy stretches across a wide frame with her right arm extended away from her fiddle, the bow blurred as she quickly draws it far from the strings. Her body is angled, almost as if in a triumphant bow, but her gentle smile looks proud as she keeps eye contact with the audience. As Rowell says, the eyes are the key.
It was important to everyone, Tucker said, to keep the book’s production as local as possible. She was able to find a printer in Lewiston, Maine. As of publishing, the books are available for pre-order and cost $85 dollars each through the end of the year.
“Photography is [Jack’s] thing. It defines him, but he’s also incredibly generous as a person and as a photographer. It’s all one thing, meaning his art, his photography, really does serve the community,” Tucker said. “The people he’s interested in are people who are doing an outstanding job at something, or they’re just very intriguing interesting people who have caught his attention.
“And so his instinct is to tell the world about what he finds valuable,” she continued, “and to me, that’s a very generous act, and he does a beautiful job.”
The White River Craft Center in Randolph will host a launch party on November 22 from 2–5 p.m. Preordered books will be available then for pickup and may be signed by Rowell at the party.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s McCook prison for federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees is now operational, with the first migrants having arrived this week, Gov. Jim Pillen confirmed on Thursday.
Pillen said he expects the first phase of about 200 beds to be full by Thanksgiving “as detainees are coming in each day.” He said the facility, used previously as the state’s Work Ethic Camp for men, continues to be renovated for a second phase of about 100 additional ICE detainees and will include adult men and women.
“There is work that just got approved for the bid with the federal government, and I would expect that the second phase will be ready in the first part of the new year,” Pillen said.

He offered the update Thursday at an unrelated news conference, telling reporters he had talked this week to McCook Mayor Linda Taylor. 
A group of McCook residents led by former State Sen. DiAnna Schimek of Lincoln have filed legal action to stop the center from serving as an ICE hub. A Red Willow County District Court judge denied a request to halt the project while the case works through the judicial process. 
A spokesman for American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska said advocates meanwhile are on alert and will monitor the access migrants at the McCook center have to legal counsel, health care and language services as they await or fight deportation proceedings.
ACLU spokesman Sam Petto lamented that “Nebraska has signed up to be part of a mass detention and deportation program” that advocates have seen “separate families, violate people’s rights and create fear in our communities.”
He referred to a high-profile ICE-led worksite immigration raid in Omaha in June, saying that South Omaha merchants and families continue to feel negative impact and fear of increased ICE presence. 
Attorneys from ACLU, the Omaha-based Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement and more stepped in to help many of the more than 70 undocumented workers detained during that raid. Those migrants were held in a Lincoln County jail in North Platte, in space leased by ICE. Immigrant advocates expect access to be worse in the state-federal McCook facility.

“This is a bizarre set up of a state-owned and -operated ICE detention center,” said Petto. “We’re going to make sure, as best we can, that people’s rights are respected inside that facility and that there is access to counsel and that there is appropriate oversight.”
He said many questions remain about the McCook facility and that access will be “stress tested” over the next few months.
At least some of the ICE detainees in McCook came or are coming from the Polk County jail in Iowa, Petto said. Information on who is being held at the facility is less forthcoming than in county jails, he said.
On Thursday, a spokesperson for Nebraska Corrections said inquiries regarding detainees should be directed to the federal ICE media office. She also said that, for security reasons, the state’s renovation plans would not be shared at this time.
Monday, Pillen had said he expected the McCook facility to start accepting its first detainees this week. He and others are calling the repurposed facility the “Cornhusker Clink,” a place the governor described as a Midwestern hub for ICE. 
About 186 male state prisoners had been held at the state’s low-security Work Ethnic Camp, receiving rehabilitative programming and performing work in the community before Nebraska officials reached out to the Trump administration to offer ICE detention space.
The planned conversion of the facility was announced Aug. 19. The WEC inmates have since been transferred to other state facilities, with a small portion discharged or paroled. 
Pillen’s office has estimated the contract with the feds would annually net Nebraska about $14.25 million. The Work Ethic Camp had an annual operating cost of $10.2 million. ICE has also agreed to also pay Nebraska a one-time lump sum of $5.9 million for “facility renovations.”

(Photo by Don Petersen/Associated Press)A new Trump administration rule issued late last month would override state laws that prevent consumers’ credit reports from including medical debt, potentially weakening financial protections for millions of Americans.
In recent years, more than a dozen states have taken steps to keep medical debt from hurting residents’ credit scores, passing laws with bipartisan support. But new guidance from the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau repeals a Biden-era rule that allowed states to impose their own bans. The Trump administration has interpreted the 1970 Fair Credit Reporting Act to say that it overrides state laws around reporting debt to credit bureaus.
American consumers had at least $220 billion in unpaid medical bills in 2024, according to an analysis from research nonprofit KFF. About 6% of American adults, or 14 million people, owe more than $1,000 in medical debt.
“Medical debt is a tremendous weight keeping so many families from financial security, and, unlike most other forms of debt, it’s not a choice,” North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, said last month in a statement announcing that a new state program had wiped out more than $6.5 billion in medical debt for more than 25 million North Carolinians.
People rarely plan to take on debt from medical care, as they do when they borrow money to buy a house or car. A one-time or short-term expense such as a single hospital stay causes about two-thirds of all medical debt, according to a 2022 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau report.
And even though most Americans have health insurance, many get stuck with unexpected medical bills because their policies have high deductibles or don’t fully cover some treatments, procedures or drugs. People in worse health and those living with a disability are more likely to report medical debt, as are middle-aged adults, Black Americans, and people with low and middle incomes, according to KFF.
In the past two years, a dozen states have passed laws forbidding medical debt from appearing on credit reports, bringing the total number of states with such laws to 14: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.
Another five states — Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Nevada and Utah — limit how and when medical debt can appear on credit reports, according to the nonprofit Commonwealth Fund.
Republican and Democratic legislators in other states, including Michigan, Ohio and South Dakota, have introduced similar bills this year.
Now the new state laws face an uncertain future. In January, while Biden was still in office,  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized a rule prohibiting credit reporting agencies from reporting medical debt in certain circumstances. Credit bureaus and credit unions sued to stop the rule. The incoming Trump administration agreed with the plaintiffs and declined to defend the rule in court, so a federal judge blocked it.
Maine state Sen. Donna Bailey, a Democrat, said in a September statement that Maine’s new law barring medical debt from appearing on consumer reports was even more important in light of the demise of the federal rule.
“Although Americans no longer have the federal protection, Mainers will continue to have protection here in our state,” she said in September. “When we go to the hospital for medical care, especially for emergencies, any debt that we take on should not hold us back from buying a car, renting a home or taking out a loan.”
But the Trump administration’s latest order would render state laws such as Maine’s moot.

Republican lawmakers on Monday called on Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to broaden the upcoming special session agenda and de-emphasize looming federal spending cuts. (Patrick Lohmann / Source NM) New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said Thursday she would call lawmakers into a special session to extend food benefits to New Mexico residents reliant on federal food aid.
At the end of October, the governor and state legislators announced $30 million in state funding to compensate for SNAP after the United States Department of Agriculture announced it would not pay Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits during the federal shutdown. Federal judges since then have ordered the Trump administration to pay out the benefits, but they remain delayed and are expected to be less than usual.
The $30 million appropriation runs out on Monday.
A news release from the governor’s office said the special session is expected to last one day. It will be the second time the governor has called state lawmakers into session to address federal fallout from reduced appropriations for benefit programs. During the three-day session that began Oct. 1, lawmakers ultimately passed an approximate $162 million spending package to compensate for health care and food assistance cuts at the federal level
That’s a wrap: Special session ends with funding for health care, food assistance and more

In a statement Thursday, the governor—who is currently attending the U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Brazil— said the state “acted fast in October when the Trump administration abandoned New Mexican families, and now the legislature is coming back to finish the job. We are fortunate that several years of economic prosperity and sound fiscal management have enabled us to support New Mexicans in this time of need. However, we will not be able to fund these state supplements forever. Republicans in Congress need to come back to the table to end the longest government shut down in American history and get everyone back to work.”
Approximately 460,000 New Mexico residents receive SNAP benefits. In their absence, food banks across the state have reported a spike in clients.

“Our responsibility is to ensure that families don’t go hungry waiting for this essential nutrition program to resume,” Health Care Authority Kari Armijo said in a statement. “This special session will allow us to continue serving New Mexicans while federal funding for the SNAP program remains uncertain.”
Democratic legislative leaders Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth and House Speaker Javier Martínez, of Santa Fe and Albuquerque, respectively, both backed the special session in statements provided in a news release from the governor’s office.
“No New Mexican should go hungry because of inaction and uncertainty in Washington D.C.,” Wirth said. “The legislature is ready to step up again to ensure our families have the food assistance they need.”
State Republican legislative leaders, however, said congressional Democrats are to blame for the federal shutdown and the lost benefits and called out New Mexico’s two U.S. senators in particular.
“Ben Ray Luján and Martin Heinrich have made it crystal clear: They don’t care about you,” Senate Republican Leader Bill Sharer (R-Farmington) said in a statement. “They have repeatedly prioritized party politics over serving their constituents back home. While we’ve seen their antics before, Senators Luján and Heinrich have set a new low by holding the hard-working people of New Mexico hostage as political pawns for their partisan theatrics, forcing state lawmakers to have to shoulder the cost so that vulnerable New Mexicans can put food on their tables for the holidays.”
House Republican Leader Gail Armstrong (R-Magdalena), issued a comparable statement that said Luján and Heinrich “are refusing to fund SNAP benefits for the neediest New Mexicans. I would much prefer the Governor use her authority and influence to urge our Senate delegation to end this crisis by voting to reopen the federal government. Instead, they are holding vulnerable New Mexicans hostage for political leverage.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/roundhousepat-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-06 18:01:39.496617

(Courtesy of the Backemeyer campaign)LINCOLN — Democrats have another candidate in eastern Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District primary. 
Former U.S. State Department diplomat Chris Backemeyer will face renewable energy advocate Eric Moyer in the Democratic primary. Both are vying to challenge Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Flood. 
“Frankly, I see our country is just going really in the wrong direction,” said Backemeyer. 
Backemeyer has worked for the State Department for 20 years in Washington, D.C., with a focus on counterterrorism, economic policy and the Middle East. He moved back to Lincoln last month after accepting a buyout from the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, which thinned out the ranks of the federal bureaucracy in the early days of the second Trump administration.

He said he felt there was “no mission or purpose left” in working for the State Department after the DOGE cuts, and that serving in Congress was the only way to push back against Trump’s approach to governing. Backmeyer’s pitch to voters is a moderate focus on affordability, reasserting congressional authority over tariffs and addressing rising health care prices and the national debt. 
“Both parties are moving in opposite directions … I think there’s a lot of people in the middle that just want good … middle-of-the-road policies that will solve the problems that they see on a day-to-day basis,” Backemyer said.
Whoever emerges from the Democratic primary will most likely face Flood, who as yet has no GOP opponent and has won his past two elections by 20 and 16 percentage points, in a seat considered safely Republican by the nonpartisan Center for Politics, The Cook Political Report and Inside Elections. 
The 1st District comprises 12 Nebraska counties, including heavily Democratic Lancaster County, which is often drowned out by the region’s more conservative rural areas.

Backemeyer said while it will be a “tough race,” the district being considered a safe seat isn’t a good reason not to “get into the fight.” He pointed to his work at the State Department as an example of his being able to work with people regardless of political differences. 
One of Backemeyer’s areas of emphasis as a diplomat was Iran. He was a senior State Department negotiator for Obama’s Iran nuclear deal in 2015. During Trump’s first term, He was replaced by Andrew L. Peek in 2017 as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Iranian Affairs and moved to a new role. Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement in 2018. 
Backemeyer was also a national security advisor to former Vice President Kamala Harris. 
Daniel Bass, a spokesperson for the Flood campaign, criticized his work with former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris. He said Backemeyer has “spent more of his life in Washington than in Nebraska, so it’s no surprise that he was inspired to run by coastal Democrat wins this week.” 
“Meanwhile, Mike Flood has fought for Nebraskans,” Bass said. “To represent us, you have to be one of us.”
 During Flood’s Lincoln town hall in August, Backemeyer asked Flood a question: “Who do you work for?” referring to his vote on Trump’s “big beautiful bill.” He used it as a part of his campaign lunch video. The Flood campaign pointed out that Backemeyer was still living in D.C. at the time.

Moyer, asked about a new opponent, said the entrance of another Democratic candidate in the race validates that there is “no such thing as a safe congressional seat when Donald Trump’s failed policies are on the ballot.” 
“My campaign is building momentum throughout the district, and a competitive primary will serve the people of Nebraska well,” Moyer said 
Backemeyer said a competitive Democratic primary will only make the Democratic nominee stronger. He said he respects Moyer, but argues his experience in Washington prepares him for Congress. 
“I’ve been working on some of the country’s most difficult national security challenges … I’ve briefed presidents and vice presidents and secretaries of state. I think I have the ability to hit the ground running,” said Backemeyer.

Jeremy Moss, the first openly gay state senator in Michigan, has introduced a resolution in the Senate to put a proposal on the ballot that would remove Michigan’s constitutional ban on same-sex marriage.  “Our constitution should reflect the values of our state, and same-sex couples should be granted the same protections as heterosexual […]","Senate Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair Jeremy Moss (D-Southfield) hears testimony on a bill cutting back on incoming changes to Michigan's earned sick time law during a Feb. 11, 2025 meeting. | Kyle DavidsonState Sen. Jeremy Moss, the first openly gay state senator in Michigan, has introduced a resolution in the Senate to put a proposal on the ballot that would remove Michigan’s constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. 
“Our constitution should reflect the values of our state, and same-sex couples should be granted the same protections as heterosexual couples,” the Bloomfield Township Democrat said in a press release from his office.
Moss’ resolution removes language in Article 1 of the state Constitution that defines the only legally recognized marriage as “the union of one man and one woman in marriage,” as well as removing gendered language from the section of the constitution that deals with estates between spouses. 
The resolution comes as the U.S. Supreme Court will consider Friday whether to take up a case that seeks to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Even a decade after the landmark marriage equality decision, the LGBTQ+ community still faces increasingly hostile attacks, including a renewed political movement to re-ban same-sex marriage,” Moss said in the press release. “This effort will soon reach the Supreme Court for review. Regardless of the outcome of Court action, it’s well past time to remove the discriminatory and, as of now, unconstitutional marriage ban language in our state’s constitution.” 
If the nation’s highest court does decide to take the case, and does overturn the Obergefell decision, same-sex marriage would become illegal in Michigan, though the 2022 Respect for Marriage Act would ensure that previous marriages, as well as same-sex marriages in other states, would have to be recognized by the state. 
“In the 10 years since marriage equality became the law of the land, one thing has become abundantly clear: granting same-sex couples the right to marry, start a family, and build a life here in Michigan has brought hope and joy to so many in our communities, while hurting absolutely no one,” Attorney General Dana Nessel said in the press release from Moss. “We cannot take these rights for granted.”
Moss’s resolution mirrors a similar resolution put forward by State Rep. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor) in March, which would also put same-sex marriage on the ballot. That came just after State Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford) introduced his own resolution condemning Obergefell and urging the Supreme Court to overturn the decision. 
Moss made headlines when he sat in on Schriver’s press conference on the resolution — and took over answering questions from the press after Schriver left.

“I think that people respect their LGBTQ neighbors, their LGBTQ family members. These marriages have been the law of the land for 10 years,” he said at that time. 
The Senate resolution has been referred to the Senate Committee on Civil Rights, Judiciary and Public Safety to be debated. Morgan’s House resolution was referred to the Committee on Government Operations — sometimes known as where bills go to die — shortly after its introduction in March, where it still sits. 
In order to make it onto the ballot, the resolution would need to pass with a two-thirds majority in both chambers.

Democrats voted at disproportionately high levels across New Mexico in the local elections that concluded earlier this week, according to a Source New Mexico analysis. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Tuesday’s statewide local elections were for nonpartisan races, but a Source New Mexico analysis shows New Mexico Democratic voters showed up at the polls at disproportionately high rates. 
Consider this: Even though Democrats comprise 43% of New Mexico’s registered voters, they made up 53% of the voters who cast ballots in elections this week.
That pattern is true in 32 of 33 counties in New Mexico, where Democrats turned out at rates higher than registration statistics would suggest, according to a Source New Mexico analysis. 
Even in an off-year election in which voters cast ballots in nonpartisan races, Democrats showing up at a disproportionately high rate shows their enthusiasm, Gabe Sanchez, a University of New Mexico political science professor, told Source New Mexico on Thursday. 
“We’re seeing the same trends nationally, like Democrats had a huge night across the country on Tuesday, and a lot of that was higher turnout in those jurisdictions the last time around,” Sanchez said. “New Mexico tends to follow, in many cases, national patterns.”
Energized Dems trumpet wins in state elections, buckle up for midterms

Democrats made up 53% of roughly 350,000 New Mexico voters who cast ballots in Tuesday’s election. In some counties, they turned out at rates 10 or more percentage points higher than their registration statistics. 
Republicans, on the other hand, made up 31.7% of the voters in the election this week, slightly less than the 31.9% they comprise of all statewide registered voters. They overperformed their registration in just 22 counties, as well. 
As for voters who don’t belong to the two major political parties, including members of third parties and those who decline to register with a party, they represent about 26.5% of statewide voters but only about 15% of those who voted in the recent elections. 
According to Source’s analysis, Lea County was the only county in the state where Democrats constituted a smaller proportion of voters on Tuesday when compared to county-wide registration. The difference is small: About 18.3% of Lea County’s registered voters are Democrats versus a 17.6% Democratic turnout.
Sanchez, who said Source’s analysis was a reasonable way to gauge enthusiasm, said he wasn’t all that surprised to hear Lea County stood alone in that respect.
“That county has always been a little bit of an outlier, but it’s hard to draw a lot of conclusions from it,” he said. “I’ve always said I felt like that area has been the most sensitive to seeing Trump on or off the ballot.” 
Republicans far outnumber Democrats in Lea County, which sits in the Permian Basin, and Sanchez said the county’s turnout depends heavily on whether Trump is on the ballot. That’s less true in other counties, based on his experience.
The story the Democratic turnout tells in the rest of the state, he said, is one being told across the country, with Democrats winning races up and down the ballot.

(Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)I’ve never been one to sit still. As a youth, I was a gymnast and figure skater, and competed in the World Cheerleading & Dance Championships. Today, I’m an avid rock climber, biker, and skier. As a young adult, I studied computer engineering and management science, worked at some of the biggest tech firms, and helped launch one of the first mobile analytics platforms.
As mobile technologies took off, I realized I could combine my passions for fitness and technology, and co-founded an app business that offers free and affordable personalized fitness coaching. Our app is AI-powered and expert-led, and has helped members log millions of exercise minutes.
But there’s a new challenge on the horizon. This year, lawmakers across the U.S. have introduced nearly 1,000 bills regulating AI, and several states have already passed new AI laws. To be clear, I’m in favor of AI regulation. The challenge is that the new and proposed laws vary widely from state to state, which means independent app developers like me will have to navigate scores of different compliance requirements. As more states pass AI laws, we’ll face an increasingly complex regulatory patchwork that’s likely to raise costs, slow innovation, and make it harder for people to access our app. We’d be much better served by smart, comprehensive, national AI legislation.
My company’s mission is to help people live stronger, healthier lives — and AI plays a vital role in our work. For example, we offer video-based AI-assisted feedback on members’ exercise technique. That helps them maximize their workouts’ effectiveness and minimize their chance of injury, and means millions of people can access the kind of personalized training long reserved for elite athletes and affluent individuals.
We’re always thinking about integrating new AI tools to make our app even more helpful and accessible. But a patchwork of state AI laws could make that much harder. Utah’s law takes a light-touch approach, requiring only AI-use disclosures. But our customers come from across the country, and many states’ laws are likely to be far more demanding. The Colorado AI Act, for instance, requires costly audits for some companies that develop or use AI. The Colorado AI Act is an ambitious, well-motivated effort to mitigate AI’s risks. That’s a good thing. My concern is that if lawmakers in numerous states enact different but similarly ambitious AI laws, they’ll inadvertently snare small developers in a tangle of complex regulations and high costs.
In the European Union, requirements similar to those in Colorado typically cost businesses tens of thousands of dollars to implement. Small developers, many of whom are self-funded, will struggle to pay those costs in even one state. If multiple states adopt such requirements, it will quickly become prohibitively expensive for entrepreneurs to launch and grow AI-powered startups.
Even tracking the different rules and determining whether we fall within a law’s scope will require lawyers and compliance teams. That could put us at a major disadvantage against bigger industry players that can handle those requirements and costs. Worse, it means we’ll have to spend time and money on compliance instead of improving our app, and we may be forced to raise prices for our end users.
Lawmakers’ concerns about AI are understandable; AI needs guardrails. But a haphazard patchwork of state regulations is likely to stifle innovation and prevent app developers from succeeding, and could lead to dramatically inequitable outcomes. In states with strict regulations, residents may miss out on life-enhancing AI-powered tools that help with things like job searches and medical care. In states with weak — or no — regulations, residents may be subject to dangerous scams and misinformation.
The U.S. urgently needs a national AI law. It’s time for lawmakers in Washington to craft smart, balanced AI legislation that gives developers clear, consistent rules, protects all Americans from AI’s risks, and allows all of us to benefit from its transformative capabilities.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/capitolnov262024miranda-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-06 18:01:39.496617

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Beneficient executives and attorneys pleaded Thursday for patience and understanding from the Kansas Legislature after indictment of the firm’s founder, who used spectacular predictions of wealth creation to charm state legislators into awarding the company a special bank charter.
Interim Beneficient CEO James Silk joined Derek Fletcher, company’s president and chief fiduciary officer, at a House and Senate committee hearing in the Statehouse two days after the arrest of former CEO and founder Brad Heppner.
Silk delved into the indictment controversy, which he referred to as “the elephant in the room.” He said a Beneficient auditing committee discovered evidence Heppner engaged in fraud during his leadership of the company.
“What that internal investigation determined was consistent with … what was set out in the indictment,” Silk told legislators. “While the indictment is upsetting to all of us and serving a legitimate red flag for any organization, … we are aligned with the U.S. government about identifying, remedying and moving forward on this. You don’t have to be a Venezuelan drug cartel boat driver to know that you want to be on the U.S. government side of that.”
The indictment unsealed in New York City asserted Heppner enriched himself by illegally siphoning about $150 million from GWG Holdings, which was at a time linked to Beneficient. Heppner led both companies and allegedly controlled a shell company where he purportedly moved large amounts of cash for personal use on property, travel and other expenditures. GWG Holdings was forced into bankruptcy, which cost 15,000 investors about $1 billion.
The U.S. Department of Justice contended Heppner engaged in securities fraud, wire fraud, made false statements, falsified records and engaged in a conspiracy to commit fraud. He was arrested Tuesday in Dallas.
Silk said that, unlike Heppner, he wouldn’t try to bedazzle legislators by claiming Beneficient was on the verge of of expanding its business in Kansas and making people very rich. He said Beneficient had a few transactions in the pipeline, but it would be folly to claim the company was on the cusp of deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
“It’s fair to say that we have, in the past, overpromised and underdelivered,” he said. “We’re not about chasing stock price. We want to build fundamental value.”
Fletcher said Beneficient was headed in the right direction but would need time to reshape the company into something worthy of trust from investors and regulators.
“We understand the seriousness of the moment and the circumstances that have arisen, and we’re committed to moving forward with integrity,” Fletcher said. “The news over the last few months, and particularly the last 48 hours, has been disappointing, troubling and, quite frankly, for me, one of sadness.”
Heppner was the key Beneficient contact as Republicans and Democrats were showed with campaign donations and the Legislature passed a bill in 2022 that guaranteed Beneficient a bank charter like no other in Kansas. Heppner remained a presence at House and Senate committees with oversight of financial institutions before forced out of Beneficient in June.
The state passed a law enabling Beneficient to engage in alternative asset deals in exchange for financially supporting economic development activities in rural Kansas. The agenda included construction of a grocery store in Hesston, a city in Kansas where Heppner grew up. So far, Beneficient officials said, $9 million was set aside for Kansas economic development. Work on the grocery store has been slow, but a Hesston foundation devoted to the project said Heppner’s resignation led to a reappraisal of the plan that could make it more likely the project was built.
The state law crafted to serve Beneficient’s interests prevented the Kansas Office of State Bank Commissioner, or OSBC, from regulating the entity as it would a traditional bank or trust. The Dallas-based firm has specialized in exchange of cash or stock for illiquid assets held by large investors. The company sought the bank charter to give it leverage in the marketplace.
David Herndon, the state bank commissioner, also addressed the Joint Fiduciary Financial Institutions Committee. He opposed awarding Beneficient a charter. For years, he urged the Legislature to strengthen regulatory oversight of the company or repeal the statute entirely. In Herndon’s view, Beneficient could conduct its alternative asset business without the charter. Beneficient executives disagreed with that conclusion.
Herndon said concerns about Beneficient included financial stress on the company, tardy filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company’s low stock price, claims that employees weren’t being paid, the low number of Beneficient transactions, the company founder’s abrupt exodus and the subsequent indictment. A financial examination by bank regulators revealed violations by Beneficient, he said.
“Significant and repeated violations of the Kansas statutes and regulations have been cited,” Herndon said. “Due to the volume of these violations, OSBC has proposed issuance of a formal corrective action.”
Sen. Stephen Owens, a Republican from Hesston, asked Herndon why regulations hadn’t been issued by the state to guide the business model adopted by Beneficient. Herndon said OSBC didn’t have authority to adopt those rules.
Owens criticized Herndon for questioning the state’s ability to provide meaningful regulatory oversight of Beneficient.
“There is such strong opposition, yet zero evidence … that there’s been any harm to the Kansas taxpayer,” the senator said. “While the business certainly hasn’t gone in the way that I think anybody has expected, I continue to reiterate the fact that there is no risk and no harm has come to the Kansas taxpayer for the passing of this (Beneficient) legislation and allowing an industry to get a foothold.”
Rep. Nick Hoheisel, R-Wichita, said allegations against Heppner contained in the indictment were disappointing. It was important to remind Kansans that Heppner was no longer part of Beneficient, he said.
“It’s a new day for the company,” Hoheisel said. “We need to figure out was Beneficient … built on those lies that Mr. Heppner described here? Or, is it an actual business model that can succeed? That’s what we’re going to get to the bottom of.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Beneficient-executives-gang-of-four-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-06 17:18:29.587566
,DC,2025-11-06 22:14:43+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"US Senate talks continue on end to 37-day shutdown, but final deal elusive","Ariana Figueroa, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-talks-continue-end-37-day-shutdown-final-deal-elusive,,"WASHINGTON —  Senate Democrats left their Thursday caucus lunch tight-lipped as an agreement to end the government shutdown, now the longest in U.S. history at 37 days, remained elusive.Republicans have floated a deal that includes the reinstatement of federal workers laid off by President Donald Trump, but no votes were scheduled on a spending bill as of late Thursday afternoon. There was some speculation senators could work through the weekend.The chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said negotiations are still underway. But she said as part of a deal, she supported the rehiring of the thousands of federal workers the Trump administration fired in its Reductions in Force, or RIFs, during the government shutdown that began Oct. 1.“Those who were RIF’d during the shutdown should be recalled,” she said. “We’re still negotiating that language.”Emboldened by this week’s Election Day victories, where Democrats swept major local and state races, Senate Democrats are seeking to use that momentum as leverage to get Republicans to also agree to a health care deal to end the government shutdown.While Democrats have pushed to extend tax credits for health care, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Thursday that the best he can offer is a vote on extending those subsidies, which expire this year. The coming expiration has resulted in millions of people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace receiving notices of a drastic spike in premium costs.“I can't speak for the House, and obviously I can't guarantee an outcome here, and they know that,” Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said. “I think the clear path forward here, with regard to the ACA issue, is they get a vote, and we open up the government, and we head down to the White House and sit down with the president and talk about it.”

Democrats that represent states with a high population of federal employees, such as Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, are also seeking to strike a deal on RIFs. A federal judge blocked those Reductions in Force last month.Kaine told reporters Wednesday that those negotiations are occurring with the White House.“It is an item that is being discussed with the president, with the White House,” Kaine said.The progressive wing of the Democratic Party has stressed that unless there is a commitment from House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump to extend health care tax credits, Democrats should not agree to pass a stopgap spending bill to reopen the government. In session next week?Senators are still scheduled to leave Capitol Hill late Thursday and be out next week on recess for the Veterans Day holiday.But a couple Senate Republicans said late Thursday afternoon that lawmakers might stay in Washington, D.C. into Friday or later.“I think they're trying to work towards a vote tomorrow, maybe through the weekend. I'm pro-through the weekend,” Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said in an interview following a GOP lunch meeting.Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., likened the situation to a “goat rodeo,” which is a hyperbolic phrase to refer to a disaster.“We're probably going to have a vote tomorrow, and then we will get on, and then we will know where we are, and we'll know whether the Democrats are serious or not,” Kennedy said, adding that he was unsure exactly what they were voting on.Democrats quiet about any dealFollowing their Thursday caucus lunch, Democrats did not seem closer to an internal agreement on how to move forward with resolving the government shutdown as they left their huddle. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats had a “very good, productive meeting.”One of the top negotiators for Democrats on finding a deal, New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, declined to comment.Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman threw his hands up as he left the room.“I don’t know how productive it was,” Fetterman, who has voted with Republicans to move legislation to reopen the government, said. Some Democrats said they were unified, such as New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim, Michigan’s Gary Peters and Connecticut’s Chris Murphy, a top appropriator. Peters did not specify what issue Democrats were unified on. “I don't want to get into that, but it was an encouraging caucus (meeting) because there's a great deal of unity as we came out,” he said.Revised stopgap?Additionally, a new continuing resolution, or CR, is needed, as the stopgap funding measure would have funded the government until Nov. 21, now just two weeks away. The House, which Johnson has kept in recess since September, would also need to be called back to pass a new version of a CR.As the government shutdown continues, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned this week that if funding is not restored, flights will need to be reduced by 10% in some air spaces due to a shortage of air traffic controllers, who have worked without pay for weeks.The government shutdown has led to millions of federal workers furloughed or required to work without pay and has created uncertainty for vulnerable people who rely on food assistance and  heating services, as well as stoppages in vital child development and nutrition programs. In an effort to force Democrats to vote to reopen the government, the Trump administration has tried to withhold Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits for 42 million people, until a court ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to release those benefits. Frustrated with the government shutdown, Trump has also tried to pressure Republicans into doing away with the Senate’s filibuster, which requires a 60-vote threshold, but Thune has resisted those calls. Progressives: ‘Do not cave’Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said during a Thursday press conference that he’s “not promising anyone anything” when it comes to a House vote on extending health care tax subsidies.  Johnson criticized Senate Democrats for wanting a guarantee that the House would also take a vote on extending the ACA taxes.“That’s ridiculous,” he said. House progressives said they have one message for Senate Democrats: “Do not cave,” as Rep. Pramila Jayapal put it during a Thursday morning press conference outside the U.S. House.“Any deal must secure the extension of the ACA tax credits and ensure health care for the American people with agreement from the House, the Senate and the White House, full stop. We have the momentum,” the Washington state Democrat said.Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., who publicly confronted Johnson during a press conference Wednesday, said, “We require a deal that actually addresses the health care crisis, not that promises to think about addressing it down the road in two weeks, with concepts of a plan.”“Sadly, at this point in time, even I say it's impossible to trust our Republican colleagues to honor their promises and their obligations,” Houlahan said.April Verette, president of the labor union SEIU, which represents roughly 2 million members, spoke alongside Jayapal and Houlahan and praised Democrats as “courageous.”“We are determined to say ‘Stick with this fight’ because righteousness, morality is on our side,” Verette said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-11-06 18:01:39.496617

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) must use available contingency funds and other allocated emergency subsidies to restore the full $9 billion in November food stamp benefits by Friday, a Rhode Island federal judge ruled Thursday. 
Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. expressed his displeasure with President Donald Trump’s administration for its failure to comply with his Oct. 31 order to pay for partial Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits using emergency money during a Zoom hearing.   
But in a court filings, Patrick A. Penn, USDA’s Deputy Under Secretary, had argued that making partial payments would result in weeks, if not months, of delays.
“If that continued to be the case, then the administration was required under this court’s order to immediately make the full payment for November SNAP benefits considering the finding that irreparable harm would occur,” McConnell said.
“Just to be clear, irreparable harm means harm to families, elderly and children and others that cannot be undone. The evidence shows that people will go hungry, food pantries will go empty and needless suffering will occur. That’s what irreparable harm means.”
About 42 million people who receive SNAP benefits, including 145,000 Rhode Islanders, have been without benefits since Nov. 1, as the ongoing government shutdown leaves the program unfunded.
“Last week, SNAP benefits lapsed for the first time in our nation’s history,” McConnell said. “This is a problem that could have and should have been avoided.”
On Oct. 30, a coalition of cities and nonprofit organizations filed a lawsuit against USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins to force the government to pay SNAP after November funding dried up. The Trump administration had refused to use contingency funding to keep SNAP funded, something his administration did during his first tenure in 2019.
At the start of Thursday’s hearing, McConnell gave both parties 15 minutes to rehash their arguments in court, but most of the hourlong hearing was consumed by the judge’s own arguments that the federal government had betrayed the terms of the order he issued from the bench Oct. 31 and in writing a day later.
The feds had two options: Fund SNAP fully for the month of November, or “expeditiously resolve the administrative and clerical burdens” that would block payments from going out later than Wednesday, McConnell’s original order prescribed.
“Nothing was done consistent with the court’s order to clear the way to expeditiously resolve it,” McConnell said. “Maybe it’s a state problem, maybe not.”
Whether the responsibility fell upon states or not was irrelevant to the harm that would come to hungry people, McConnell said.
“It’s likely that SNAP recipients are hungry as we sit here,” he said. 
McConnell cited Trump’s social media post on Tuesday  saying he would cut off all SNAP benefits unless U.S. Senate Democrats voted to reopen the government. 
USDA previously said on Monday it would partially subsidize the program, but states were left to calculate a new funding formula for partial benefits. On Tuesday, the feds first erroneously cited that it would furnish recipients with 50% of their typical benefits; new court filings a day later stated up to 65% of full benefits would be funded. 
Additionally, USDA’s guidance Tuesday noted that 30% of a household’s net monthly income would be subtracted from the reduced benefit allotment. That would have resulted in some recipients receiving no benefits at all. The additional layer of number crunching also meant states were slowed in their attempts to dispense benefits. 
Minutes before the hearing, Gov. Dan McKee announced that state officials threw away their calculations for partial SNAP payments ordered by the courts last week and started over after receiving new guidance from the Trump administration late Wednesday night.
“Despite these ongoing changes from the USDA, our team at the Rhode Island Department of Human Services is working urgently to complete calculations in compliance with the latest federal guidance,” McKee wrote.
McConnell said because the government did not “expeditiously resolve” the stemmed flow of benefits that came from having to set up partial payments, USDA will need to make the full payments by Friday. The money will come from the existing contingency fund available for SNAP — which, in its partial satisfaction of the request, the agency said it could not exhaust — plus money from Section 32, a flexible USDA fund that has also been used to sustain the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) during the shutdown. 
The feds had argued that use of Section 32 would deplete the money for the Children’s Nutrition Program, but McConnell countered and said that, even if $4 billion was diverted to SNAP for the month of November, there would still be enough money to fund the Children’s Nutrition Program through “May and beyond” of next year. 
“After creating this SNAP crisis, President Trump and his administration continue to present states with unnecessary barriers in implementing these critical benefits swiftly,” McKee said. “These funds should have been released long before the court order, with a single, straightforward set of guidance that ensured recipients received the maximum benefits possible.

(Amanda Mills/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the Arkansas Department of Agriculture announced a farm-to-table program Thursday for Arkansas schools that will provide meals to students using ingredients raised or grown in-state.
Called the Arkansas Plate Initiative, it will start as a pilot program in five schools in 2026, a press release from Sanders’ office said.
“Arkansas students deserve access to healthy, nutritious foods at school, and the Arkansas Plate Initiative shows meaningful progress in our effort to improve child nutrition and support our farmers and producers across the state,” Sanders said in the release. “Not only will this program give students access to fresh, locally sourced products, but it will also teach them about Arkansas’ largest industry and what it takes to keep it.”
Starting in January, the program will feature “monthly ‘Arkansas Plate Days,’” with school cafeterias serving meals using Arkansas-grown foodstuffs such as poultry and rice, and fruits and vegetables.
New report ranks Arkansas’ food insecurity rate worst in the U.S.

Participating schools will also “receive educational materials, promotional signage, and ‘Meet the Farmer’ profiles to help students discover more about where their food comes from and learn the importance of supporting Arkansas agriculture,” according to the release.
The program appears to be similar to the federally-funded Farm to School and Local Food Purchase Assistance programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The latter program also helps local schools purchase locally-sourced ingredients for school meals. It faced sweeping cutbacks in the early days of President Donald Trump’s second term, despite support from state agriculture commissioners, including Arkansas Department of Agriculture Secretary Wes Ward. 
The Arkansas Department of Agriculture did not respond to questions regarding the new initiatives’ relation to federal school meal programs nor about how the initiative would be funded.
The new initiative is the latest in a series of nutrition-related moves made by the Sanders administration and state legislators this year. After signing the bipartisan Act 123 of 2025, which provides free school breakfasts to all Arkansas students, earlier this year, Sanders also announced that the Department of Corrections would provide produce harvested by incarcerated individuals to the Marion School District for breakfasts and lunches.
The announcement also comes at a time of precarity for Arkansas’ agriculture industry, which is heavily reliant on commodity farming. Commodity farmers are facing some of the worst market conditions in years as prices for commodities drop and the costs of producing continue to rise.

The state NAACP, Common Cause and a group of voters known as the Williams plaintiffs asked the federal judges to block the state from holding an election using the new district lines Republican legislators approved last month. 
Republicans in the state legislature joined the national redistricting war when they reconfigured election boundaries for the 1st District to draw in more GOP voters. President Donald Trump has asked Republican-led states to redraw their congressional district maps to maximize GOP advantages in the midterm elections. 
The redrawn North Carolina map is likely to take the state’s congressional delegation from 10 Republicans and 4 Democrats to 11 Republicans and three Democrats. 
The new 1st District lines dismantle a region known as the Black Belt, where a cross-county bloc of Black voters has helped elect a Black Democrat to Congress since 1992. 
Republican legislators said during debates over the district that the redraw was strictly partisan, and no racial data was used to create the new lines. 
The 1st Congressional District was already included among other districts in a federal racial gerrymandering case. Oral arguments were held in that case last summer. The judges have not issued a ruling yet. 
The NAACP plaintiffs told the judges that the new 1st District boundaries are even worse than the district lines used in the 2024 election. They claim the new plan retaliates against voters based on how they voted. 
States usually redistrict once a decade after the census. North Carolina redistricts more often to comply with court orders. This year was the first time district lines were redrawn at a president’s request. 
A mid-decade redistricting “for the sole purpose of targeting the other party’s voters is a very distinct and clear attack on constitutional rights,” Dan Vicuña, senior policy director for voting and fair representation at Common Cause, told reporters during a video news conference Thursday.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4636-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-06 17:18:29.587566

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator) Three days before they were hired, LSU’s next leader and the incoming chancellor of its Baton Rouge campus started discussing a plan they would pitch to the Board of Supervisors to restructure the university’s system of campuses across the state. 
Incoming President Wade Rousse, currently the head of McNeese State University in Lake Charles, and newly hired Chancellor Jim Dalton, currently provost at the University of Alabama, were two of three finalists for the LSU presidency. Their discussion did not include the third finalist, former University of Arizona President Robert Robbins, in their discussion. 
The pair came to the board with their plan to split the president and chancellor roles, which had been merged in 2012. They also wanted Dalton to become an executive vice president overseeing the research-intensive entities in the system, which include Pennington Biomedical Research Center, the LSU AgCenter and LSU’s medical schools in New Orleans and Shreveport. 
LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard had said multiple times he didn’t think the positions should be split, most recently Oct. 29, just after the presidential search committee narrowed the candidate pool down to the three finalists. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In addition to a new president and chancellor, the LSU Board of Supervisors announced Tuesday its intent to significantly reorganize the system to boost the university’s research goals. 
While the new plan is in flux and will not be finalized until the board votes next month, Ballard said about 95% of the new structure is solidified. 
Rousse said he and Dalton have an “agreement in principle” that Dalton will oversee the academic side of things, while Rousse will manage the public facing aspects of the university, including external affairs, government relations and athletics. 
“The LSU research enterprise will now report as a unified system, reflecting the collaborative strengths of our institutions, unified,” Ballard said at a news conference earlier this week. 
Unifying LSU’s research institutions under Dalton is being done to boost the university’s total research spending figures, one of several research metrics LSU needs to boost to join the prestigious Association of American Universities, an organization of the nation’s top higher education research institutions.  
Unifying LSU was a key part of the strategic framework for the system put forward by former President William Tate, who left his job in June to accept the same position at Rutgers University in New Jersey. 
In 2023, the most recent year data is available from the National Science Foundation, LSU spent $384 million on research, which ranks 83rd among universities. LSU Health Shreveport spent $35 million, and LSU Health New Orleans spent $68 million. Adding their amounts to LSU Baton Rouge would elevate it to the 69th slot, overtaking Carnegie Mellon University, a member of the Association of American Universities. 
But according to the National Science Foundation, LSU can’t compile all of its campuses statewide into a single slot to improve its research rankings. 
“Each campus with its own chancellor, president or similar head is considered its own institution, a categorization established in 2010… That allows for more comparable data between private institutions and multi-campus state institutions,” a foundation spokesperson said. “We approach the Louisiana State system as we approach all state systems, per those parameters.” 
While details are still sparse about what it will look like, LSU leaders have said they are reworking the system’s organizational chart, indicating they may have developed a new reporting structure that could mitigate the National Science Foundation’s concerns. 
Having athletics at the flagship campus report to the system president, rather than that campus’ new chancellor, is an unusual arrangement. Before the two roles were merged, athletics reported to the chancellor of the main campus. Having athletics report to the system president essentially elevates it to being treated as an institution of its own rather than part of the Baton Rouge campus. 
The arrangement separating Rousse from the academic side of the university comes as a relief for faculty, who expressed skepticism about Rousse’s qualifications to run a major research institution. 
Rousse lacks several of the key qualifications the search committee established for presidential applicants. Unlike LSU, McNeese does not hold a top research designation, and Rousse did not ascend to his administrative rank though the traditional academic promotion path. He also hasn’t published a significant amount of research. 
Rousse also provided vague answers when asked about LSU’s goal to become a top-50 public research university. 
Dalton has an extensive research background and has served for five years as the chief academic officer of the University of Alabama, which, like LSU, holds the top research designation.

But on Thursday, the State Board of Education heard that none of them met those goals, and one missed by nearly 70%.
“We hear a lot about the waiting lists for charter schools,” said vice chair Alan Duncan during Thursday’s meeting. “But this year’s openings have not attracted anywhere near the number of projected students. Have there been any discussions among the Charter School Review Board members about what this trend means for further opening of charter schools?”
State Board of Education meeting on Nov. 6. 2025 (Photo: Ahmed Jallow/NC Newsline)
Duncan raised the question during a presentation from the Charter School Review Board, which provides monthly updates to the state board. Ashley Logue, director of the Office of Charter Schools, said one reason is that new charter schools, especially those in larger counties, face stiff competition from both established charter and traditional schools.
Logue said enrollment projections are difficult to “lock down” because parents have so many options, particularly in large counties where they often apply to multiple schools. This makes it hard for any single charter school to accurately anticipate which students will actually enroll.
“There’s the LEA, there’s magnet options, there’s charter options, there’s voucher options — so many options that you have parents applying to multiple places,” Logue told the board. “It’s hard to kind of lock down those numbers, which, again, is why I think we need to start earlier with doing checks on that.”
Several new schools missed their projections by wide margins.
Triad International Studies Academy in Guilford County projected to enroll 144 students in its first year but drew just 45, below the state’s required minimum of 80. Last month, the Charter Review Board voted to close the school effective December 31, but financial problems forced it to shut down two weeks later.
Liberty Charter, also in Guilford County, projected 500 students but enrolled only 172, nearly 66% below its projection.
“This is not an isolated problem,” said Logue, “We’re seeing fewer parents committing to new charter schools. Historically, a school might lose 10% of its projected enrollment. Now, some are seeing losses closer to 25%.”
Not all missed their enrollment projections by such wide margins. Anderson Academy in Forsyth County and North Oak Academy in Durham only missed by 5% and 14%, respectively.
Moving forward, Logue said, the review board is exploring stricter guidance for applicants.
“Our proposal would be that there are stricter guidelines earlier in the process to say, ‘Hey, you’re not where you need to be with enrollment,’” Logue said, “and to slow that process so that either they delay and have more time to prepare, or they realize that perhaps this is not going to work.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/AdobeStock_CharterSchool-wo.jpg,,,2025-11-06 17:18:29.587566

(Peelee Clark / Northwest Team 2)A bipartisan piece of legislation that could have big impacts on the nation’s forest land continues to move quickly through Congress, pushing through a Senate committee last month.
The Fix Our Forests Act was introduced in the U.S. Senate in April and co-sponsored by Sen. Tim Sheehy, along with Senators from California, Utah and Colorado. 
The legislation seeks to promote prescribed burns, expand the state-federal Good Neighbor Authority program, increase collaboration among fire agencies and improve reforestation efforts after fires. It also makes some rule changes that could impact how areas designated as high fire danger are managed and how projects in those areas proceed.
“Better stewardship of our forests is not a partisan issue; it’s an imperative to securing a stronger economy, healthier forests, and safer communities,” Sheehy said in a press release. “I’m proud to see the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act move forward in the legislative process, and I’ll continue fighting alongside my colleagues to enact commonsense reforms that ensure proper forest management, unleash the resource economy, and protect American communities from the threat of wildfire.”
The governors of those four states, including Gov. Greg Gianforte, signed on to a letter in support of the legislation in late October. The bill has already worked its way through the U.S. House, though doesn’t include new appropriated funds.
The legislation has received some support from environmental and outdoor advocacy groups, with the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership calling it a “comprehensive” approach to tackling forest health and wildfire issues. The Nature Conservancy and the National Audubon Society is also in support of the legislation. 
But there has also been some concern with it, namely around how it could change the process of forest projects, especially those in a declared “emergency fireshed management” area. That’s a Biden-era designation which essentially prohibits projects from exploring alternatives on forestry projects — the only options are what’s called an “action” or “no action.” It essentially shortens the review period for projects within that designation.
Forestry actions falling within that designation are usually small in scope, but the federal legislation would push that number to include projects as large as 10,000 acres.
Even with the renewed interest in prescribed burns and other forestry projects to help with forest health, there’s still a lack of action, said Riva Duncan, the vice president of Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, an advocacy group made up of former firefighters.
According to Forest Service data, hazardous fuels reduction work across their lands was down 38% in 2025 when compared with the same period during the previous four calendar years. 
Federal cuts and Department of Government Efficiency actions caused chaos last winter and some mitigation projects never happened or were delayed. Between the cuts and needs for firefighters around the country, the work just isn’t getting done, she said.
And while DOGE actions mostly spared firefighters, supporting positions around fire mitigation work were not.
“There’s a huge network of specialists and biologists and things behind the scenes that do the environmental work to allow these fuels projects to continue,” Duncan said. “And so they were hit really hard by (DOGE cuts) and by the deferred resignations and things like that. A lot of issues are exacerbated by this administration, who has been very open about not supporting a Federal workforce.”
Prescribed burns can help mitigate risk by removing fuel that otherwise might add to the intensity of a fire. During the last 100 years the Forest Service has consistently embraced suppression as its main method of fire defense.
Land management policies “vilifying” fire have led to overgrowth and climate change continues to impact forests, Duncan said, adding suppression has been a renewed focus this summer. U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz, who spent 14 years with the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, has said the nation’s forests are in trouble because they’re not being logged enough.
“Every year the Chief of the Forest Service puts out their fire season letter, and it made pretty clear that suppression was going to be the primary focus,” Duncan said. “And I think when you look at the chief and his background coming from the timber industry, there are a lot of people who have commercial timber lands, commercial timber interests, who don’t like fire, who still will not recognize the value it brings. All it does is hurt their bottom line, right?”
Duncan also pointed out not all logging is necessarily fuel mitigation work and added she’s not specifically against logging; however, saying logging alone will solve the issue is disingenuous. 
“A lot of people who want us to log more, want more trees to come off national forest lands, will try to make that argument,” Duncan said. “Sometimes it is, sometimes it’s not. Often it’s not.”
Grassroots Wildland Firefighters did submit a comment on the Fix Our Forests bill and she said it’s an acknowledgment that more fuel work needs to be done.
“Fire is non-partisan. It doesn’t recognize boundaries or recognize if it’s private or federal land, if it’s commercial versus being managed for ecological reasons,” Duncan said. “And so we need a comprehensive solution with everybody at the table who has a stake, and everybody has a stake.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Windy-Rock-Fire-Peelee-Aug-30-3Medic-1024x649.jpg,,,2025-11-06 16:56:58.434930

Ed Stafman looking at the art and architecture before he presents his first bill in committee. (Eric Seidel for the Daily Montanan)Bozeman Democratic Rep. Ed Stafman resigned from the Legislature on Nov. 1, effective immediately. 
The 71-year-old former trial attorney and Rabbi Emeritus was first elected in 2020 and served his third Legislative session in Helena this year, representing House District 59.
In his resignation letter to the Montana Secretary of State on Nov. 1, Stafman said serving in the Legislature was “one of the greatest honors of my life.

“This decision was not made lightly,” he wrote. “Public service is a calling, but it also requires sacrifice. And at this point in my life, I feel a strong pull toward my family — especially welcoming and spending time with my new grandchild. I believe this is where I am most needed now.”
Stafman told the Daily Montanan on Thursday that opting to step down during the interim came after he made the main decision not to run for a fourth full term.
“My interim work is relatively speaking, minimal,” said Stafman, who was appointed to the Law and Justice Interim Committee. “It’s not something I need to be in there for the big fight or something like that. I think it’s mostly sensible stuff that’s going to have mostly bipartisan support. I kind of felt I’d served 98% of my term.”
He added by allowing a new representative to be appointed in the upcoming weeks, they would be able to start their work in an interim committee and then he have a leg up going into the 2027 session, assuming they ran and won the seat.
Stafman won his seat during the 2024 election with 63% of the vote.

Stafman said he thought of himself as a moral compass in the Legislature, and he told the Daily Montanan since his resignation over the weekend, he had been “inundated with emails and texts from Republican legislators saying they’ll miss that aspect of me being there.”
Serving in the minority while Republicans held a supermajority, and then near-supermajority, Stafman said much of his work in the Capital was playing defense, away from the debates on the House floor.
“A lot of the work is behind the scenes so that the public and even the press doesn’t know quite how a bill was defeated,” he said. “I played quite a role behind the scenes in marshaling the resources and people to defeat some really bad legislation.”
While few of his ideas garnered support from his peers  – just one of his 17 introduced bills in 2025 made it to Gov. Greg Gianforte’s desk, and was subsequently vetoed — Stafman said there’s a long game that needs to be played. Bills have to be introduced in multiple sessions to move them through the process — first they might die in committee, then they might die on the floor, and eventually they’ll make it to the other chamber.
“Success doesn’t necessarily mean completing the task, but moving it forward,” Stafman said. “We moved a lot of things forward, and I hope others will pick up the ball and keep it rolling.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/B86A4179SN-scaled-e1762463159967-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-11-06 16:56:58.434930

The concept — where veterans can share their experiences directly with their communities — was created by journalist and author Sebastian Junger, who spent years reporting from active war zones. Vermont held its first event in 2017.

This story by Katie Lyford was first published in The Bridge on Nov. 4, 2025.
When East Thetford’s Bonnie Holbrook arrived at the Vermont Statehouse for the Vets Town Hall on Nov. 2, she wasn’t sure what to expect. She had spent her life around veterans and none of them would talk about their experiences. Holbrook decided to attend the event — a place where veterans and civilians come together for listening sessions — to better understand her family and community.
About 20 people joined Holbrook at the Town Hall, organized by Kristin Eaton, the group’s deputy director. It was one of seven similar events across the state in the weeks surrounding Veterans Day on Nov. 11, and it moved Holbrook. “Having the folks share their feelings openly is such a change from my experiences from family members, friends and my ex-husband,” she said. “So many of them had not and still do not know how to deal with it.” 
The concept of a Vets Town Hall was created by journalist and author Sebastian Junger, who had spent years reporting from active war zones. He envisioned a place where veterans could share experiences directly with their communities: no politics, no debate, just listening. 
“Historically speaking, humans overcome trauma far better when processing within a community rather than individually,” Junger said.
Vermont held its first Vets Town Hall in 2017, thanks to Eaton and Marine veteran Jon Turner, both of whom worked to bring Junger’s idea to life. Eaton said the gatherings evolve but keep the same intention: “What sticks with me most is the experience of sitting in a room with my community, listening to the stories of veterans in person,” she said. 
Turner finds reward in the veterans who decide to speak for the first time. “Some veterans, who have never spoken of their military experiences, come to listen and they realize how genuinely listened to and supported their fellow veterans are, and that moves them enough that they in turn decide to share.” 
This year’s event at the Statehouse was the first in such a historic and symbolic space, thanks to James Ehlers, chief of staff to Lt. Gov. John Rodgers and this year’s emcee. 
Ehlers, himself a veteran, said he wanted to hold the event somewhere that reflected the honor and dignity veterans deserve and that might also draw in more of the state’s elected officials. “These are real stories,” he said. “They deserve a space like this.” 
One participant was Marlon Fisher. The veteran, father and community leader had never spoken publicly about his own time in the military, and this was his first time attending a Vets Town Hall.
“I’ve talked about my military experience a few times, but only if it came up,” Fisher said. “Now, I’m working on community building, and veterans are a unique community in and of themselves that not a lot of people get. [But] in so many ways, I get it. And I think it’s important for me to share that.”
Fisher said he served as an all-source intelligence analyst for the U.S. Army in Germany with one deployment to Afghanistan. 
“I was sitting next to soldiers with guns in their holsters, my weapon of choice a laptop,” he said. “My first night of deployment, I was terrified. There was a rocket attack and horrific conditions.” He described food poisoning that left him extremely ill. “I was scared. But thanks to my ‘battle buddies’ I was able to pull through. Fast-forward to the end of my year there, and it was like the first night repeated, another rocket attack. But as I looked around, seeing my battle buddies, I realized I was no longer afraid. That is the power of community.”
Vietnam War Army Captain and Chief Nurse Maureen L. Dwyer shared a similar experience. 
“The night we arrived in Vietnam, it was so surreal,” she said. “Not seeing a bunker, having armed sergeants escorting us saying, ‘Stay behind us.’ I said to myself, ‘You’re not in Kansas anymore,’” she added. She said her time in Vietnam taught her the “oneness of community.”
“There was no family there, so it was a very different nursing experience because even though it was ‘off to the races’ every day, we were like a family, both your colleagues, as well as the patients, who were mostly young men,” she recalled. “You couldn’t help but love them, more than a professional nurse in the States would, because there’s no family. And because some of them were not going to make it out of there.”

Army Ranger Scott Wood graduated from Montpelier High School in 1987. Shortly after, he went to the Berlin Armory to enlist. 
“I was sick of people telling me what to do, so I decided to join the Army,” he said. Never having flown before, on his second flight he found himself standing in the door of a plane about to jump out. 
“I recall thinking, ‘I can’t believe I’m getting paid to do this!,’” he said. “And then I have the other experience of seeing and doing things that no one should ever have to. But in a way, I feel fortunate to have gone through the dark stages and be able to now help other veterans.” 
He recounted coming upon another Ranger who had suffered a spinal injury. “We came upon him literally five minutes after the jump. And he is lying there, so broken, begging for help. This was just a small moment, one, maybe two minutes in time. But it was like an image captured with the world’s best camera. It is engrained in your memory. You move on, because you have to. … And then that moment pops up while you’re in traffic or at a family dinner.”
Not all veterans will share and many do not even attend such events. Several told The Bridge they cannot bear to think about their service time at all. Turner said he hopes they have what they need and that he has made it his mission to help as many as possible. 
Misha Pemble-Belkin, a soldier whom Junger met while filming in Afghanistan and whom many credit as their inspiration to speak out, frames this silence as part of what veterans are taught: “You learn to not feel,” he said. “Then, when you come home, you have to learn to feel again.” 
Wood noted: “What I tell veterans all the time is, ‘It’s okay not to be okay, but it’s not okay to struggle in silence. The more you get it out, instead of bottling up, the better it gets. If I could have anything to say to somebody, it’s ‘Reach out, connect. It does get better. You shouldn’t have to live with that on your own.’”
Rodgers co-sponsored the event due to a personal experience. One of his sons and his daughter in law are veterans, and their childhood friend was deployed Afghanistan and struggled upon returning home. When their friend took his life, Rodgers’ other son, who had attempted to help, fell into a depression. The family now does all they can to try to help others. “The statistics show there are more veterans lost to suicide than war,” Rodgers said. “That means we are failing and need to do better.”
Sen. Joe Major agreed. “Veteran issues are often talked about but not always understood,” he said. “It’s vital we know what our veterans are going through — whether it’s PTSD, challenges with the VA, or adjusting to civilian life. Giving them a voice helps us learn how to help.”

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Paul Tine celebrated his six-month anniversary as commissioner of the NC Division of Motor Vehicles Thursday with something his predecessor never received – praise from state legislators.
When Tine walked into the job May 6, replacing former commissioner Wayne Goodwin, North Carolinians were waiting on average more than three hours to renew their registration or driver’s license. Booking an appointment was near-impossible and often required motorists to wait months or drive to another county with hopes of finding an open slot and a shorter line.

Over the last 28 days, the average total wait time has been one hour and 19 minutes.
Tine, a former state representative, told the Joint Legislative Transportation Oversight committee Thursday that he believes better  efficiency and agility will allow his agency to cut wait times even further.
“15 minutes is where we’re setting our goal. I think it’s attainable,” he said.
Senator Bill Rabon (R-Brunswick), co-chair of the oversight committee, signaled his approval.
“Mr. Commissioner. You have taken great strides. Don’t shorten your step. Keep it going,” Rabon told the commissioner.
Tine said his top priority has been to address the low morale in understaffed offices.
“I sat down on a listening tour to make sure that I understood the needs of our customers and the needs of our frontline staff. Last week, I finished up at all of our 113 offices,” Tine said.
To prove to current DMV examiners he was hearing their concerns, he found one-time money to repaint offices, fix flooring and replace uniforms.
“Our examiners hadn’t had new uniforms in about five years. Some of them were wearing sweaters because they were threadbare at that point, and down to one or two uniforms,” he shared.
Beyond those cosmetic changes, Tine said his office now provides direct communication all the way down to the examiner’s level, not filtered through several management layers. “People did not have a shared understanding of what the expectations were for the group,” said Tine.
Training has been revamped to get new examiners working sooner. The DMV has filled 87 positions since early August. The vacancy rate for examiners sits at 4%.

To improve how the DMV interacts with the public, the division refreshed its website and hired a social media director.
“You’ll see a lot clearer understanding of what’s necessary when you come to see us, what the steps are for each of the services. We also put in a chatbot so that you can go in there and ask questions,” Tine said.
The AI-driven chatbot is still learning. Tine acknowledged it will take a little time for it to be fully trained before it gives the best output, but it’s constantly improving, he said.
For state lawmakers who have routinely received angry complaints about the DMV, Tine said there were two improvements they could offer constituents.
The DMV now accepts walk-in customers all day, and a new software system allows customers to enter their mobile number when they sign in.
“We’ll text you. We’ll show you what your place is online. You can go and wait anywhere, watch your number, come down, and then we’ll call you into the office,” said Tine.
In September, 87% of customers served were walk-in customers seeking licenses and registration.
Tine credits Senate Bill 245 with helping expand the use of online license renewals. More than 32,000 North Carolinians have used that feature, saving customers time and preventing a backlog of appointments at local DMV offices.

“Commissioner Tine, I’m so happy that you’re here and all the work that you’ve put into helping us in southern Wake County,” said Rep. Erin Paré. The Wake County Republican said she was impressed with his responsiveness as the county looks at potential sites for a new DMV office in Fuquay-Varina.
Brunswick County Rep. Frank Iler offered his own praise as he closed out the hearing.
“I appreciate what you’re doing. I need you to do a good job. You’ve exceeded my expectations so far,” said Iler.
In December, the DMV will release a new strategic plan and select a vendor for its long-awaited IT modernization initiative. In 2026, the agency will open new offices in Brunswick and Sampson Counties.

Glenn Youngkin stepped out of the Executive Mansion on Thursday with their spouses, smiling as they paused to talk with reporters. The couples had just shared a lunch of crab cakes and “Virginia wine,” Youngkin said, as he and Spanberger discussed their transition of power in the months ahead. 
Because governors are statutorily required to live in the mansion — part museum on the ground floor and living quarters upstairs — the Spanberger family will soon need to learn the layout and get briefed on the quirks of living and governing from within Richmond’s Capitol Square for the next four years. 
“It was a wonderful discussion about the transition process and some of the basic realities of what this is going to be for our family,” Spanberger said. “We’ve got our transition office open up and running.” 
She expressed gratitude to Youngkin, his wife and his team for sharing their insights. 
Spanberger’s transition team, announced this week, includes people she worked with during her time in Congress, others with White House experience, and experts from across the state, including higher education and health care. 
Co-chair Yohannes Abraham is a visiting professor at the University of Virginia and served as director of former President Joe Biden’s transition team. Fellow co-chair Kelly Cannon is the CEO of the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association Foundation. Bonnie Krenz-Schurman will serve as chief of staff and Karen Mask as transition director — both worked for Spanberger in Congress. Another co-chair, Samson Signori, managed her campaign for governor. 
 Health care and food on the table

Asked about her first policy priorities as governor — with Democrats also controlling both the House of Delegates and state Senate — Spanberger pointed to affordability issues she emphasized on the campaign trail. 
“Increasing housing supply, lowering costs in housing, in energy, and ultimately in health care,” she said. “Obviously, there’s going to be some challenges along the way with some of the specific federal legislation.” 
Those challenges stem from Congress’ reconciliation bill passed this summer, which includes changes to Medicaid and hospital funding that could leave thousands of Virginians without coverage health insurance and strain vulnerable hospitals. 
Congress has also been gridlocked since early October over annual appropriations bills, triggering what has now become the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. 
The U.S. House has not met since mid-September, while the U.S. Senate has repeatedly failed to advance resolutions. Both parties have blamed the other as Democrats push to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies — affecting about 100,000 Virginians — and Republicans accuse them of holding the government “hostage.” Republicans, however, currently control both chambers of Congress and the White House. 
In her Election Night victory speech, Spanberger called on both parties in Congress and President Donald Trump to work together to end the shutdown as soon as possible. 
Spanberger, once ranked as one of the most bipartisan members in Congress, campaigned on bringing the same pragmatism to the governor’s office. 
Thanks to the budget decisions under Youngkin and the General Assembly, Virginia currently has a surplus that Spanberger and lawmakers will decide how to use in the 2026 budget, which could include addressing health care fallout from federal policy changes. 
Meanwhile, food assistance has become an immediate concern for roughly 850,000 Virginians who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The shutdown has prevented beneficiaries from receiving payments, though the Trump administration was ordered by a court to release part of the national contingency fund, covering only about 65% of the usual benefit amount. 
Youngkin recently established a temporary state-level version of SNAP using surplus funds to bridge the gap. He also set in motion longer-term changes — which Spanberger will inherit — to help social service agencies reduce error rates. 
Under the reconciliation bill, states with high error rates in SNAP payments may be forced to cover more of the program’s cost in the future. 
“There are many things that are still in motion that we will talk about, that hopefully will continue,” Youngkin told reporters  Thursday. “That’s what this is all about and why this transition period is one of cooperation to make sure that Governor-elect Spanberger’s administration is ready to go on Day One and any way we can help in that we will do.”

That number is higher among women, at about 71%, but lower among men, at about 58%. There is also a stark partisan split, with 80% of Democratic Latino voters feeling their civil rights are eroding but just 26% of Republicans who think the same.
“They see immigrant families being used as scapegoats and political props, even as those same workers keep Colorado’s farms, restaurants and resorts running,” Alex Sánchez, CEO of Voces Unidas de las Montañas, said during a briefing on the survey results Thursday morning. “We see Congress failing to protect families from reckless deportations and racial profiling, and they see their reproductive rights, voting rights and civil rights under attack.”

The Colorado survey was part of a national bipartisan effort to understand where Latino voters stand about one year before the 2026 midterm elections. There was an oversample of Colorado voters. The survey was conducted between Oct. 8 and Oct. 22.
When it comes to immigration issues, 40% of voters fear arrest even though they have legal status, 35% believe the workforce is shrinking because immigrants are afraid to go to work, and 30% are more afraid to report crimes and interact with local law enforcement. About 44% said they most want elected officials to create a path to citizenship for immigrants, the most popular policy choice, followed by ensuring that immigration detention facilities are safe and humane.
The survey comes about 10 months into Trump’s second term, which has been marked by a steep increase in immigration detentions and deportations, deployments of the National Guard to Democratic-led cities and a record-breaking government shutdown over whether to extend health insurance subsidies.










While Democrats continue to hold an advantage in Colorado, it's not guaranteed. Latino voters are pragmatic. We reward action, not party labels.


– Alex Sánchez, CEO of Voces Unidas de las Montañas


Overall, economic concerns such as rising costs and stagnant wages were top of mind for voters. They cited inflation, housing costs and the economy as the top issues elected officials should address, which is similar to responses in previous years. About 45% responded that the minimum wage is too low and 45% said one job does not pay enough. Another 59% said access to affordable health insurance should be a priority for lawmakers.
Over half of Latino voters predict their economic situation will be worse in a year.
“As we head into another pivotal election cycle, data like this helps ground the conversation and what matters most to our communities,” said Dusti Gurule, the president and CEO of Colorado Organization for Latina Opportunity and Reproductive Rights. “It really provides us with our marching orders to continue the work.”
A generic Democrat would get 55% of the vote for a 2026 congressional race, according to the survey, compared to about 21% for a Republican. But both parties are underperforming as compared to their 2024 numbers, which could be a sign of voter discontent with the political and electoral systems, according to researcher Gary Segura.
Among Latino voters who voted for Trump in 2024, which is about 35% of the Colorado Latino electorate, 20% said they either would not vote for Trump or did not know if they would vote for him in a do-over of 2024. For comparison, there was an 8% bleed among voters who picked former Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate last year.
“A 20% bleed for Trump voters should be very concerning to GOP political operatives,” Segura said.
About two-thirds of Latino voters disapprove of Trump’s job performance and disapprove of how the Republican Party is handling its majority in Congress. About 60% blame Republicans for the ongoing federal government shutdown that began Oct. 1. Additionally, 81% think Congress is ceding too much authority to Trump and should be using its checks-and-balances role more often.
About 51% of respondents said the Democratic Party cares “a great deal” about the Latino community, compared to the 27% who said the same about the Republican Party. At the same time, 43% said Democrats and 40% said Republicans don’t care too much about Latino interests. That could reflect the “alienation” Latino voters might feel from the political system, Segura said.
“While Democrats continue to hold an advantage in Colorado, it’s not guaranteed. Latino voters are pragmatic. We reward action, not party labels,” Sánchez said. “This poll should be a wake-up call, not just to Republicans, but for Democrats too.”

(Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A new proposal from a pair of legislative Democrats would institute a number of labor, energy and sustainability requirements on tech companies seeking to build data centers in Wisconsin. 
The proposal from Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay) and Rep. Angela Stroud (D-Ashland) comes as data centers have continued to pop up across the state — largely in southeast Wisconsin — sparking heated local debates about land use, local jobs and the centers’ heavy use of water and electricity. 
There are now 47 data centers in Wisconsin, with more under consideration by local governments. The data centers house computer servers to store information for cloud-based software and, increasingly, to support the expansion of artificial intelligence. 
For local governments, the construction of data centers offers an easy opportunity for property tax revenue from a business that won’t require many local government services. But the servers have high energy and water needs, are often sited on land that has long been used for farming and raise concerns associated with AI. Experts and advocates have been looking for the state government to weigh in more forcefully on how to regulate the centers, the Wisconsin Examiner reported last month. 
So far, the only mentions of data centers in state law are a provision in the 2023-25 state budget which exempts data center construction costs from the sales tax and a law enacted earlier this year to study the growth of nuclear power in the state. 
The proposal from Habush Sinykin and Stroud, announced Thursday, would establish rules beyond current incentives for data center growth. 
“The new legislation being proposed today is about making sure that we have clear, statewide guardrails in place that provide people in communities across Wisconsin with the information and transparency they need to engage in the local decision-making process in an informed, effective manner from the start,” Habush Sinykin, whose district includes a controversial data center project in Port Washington, said in a statement.
Under the proposal, electric companies in the state will be required to submit quarterly reports to the Public Service Commission on the amount of energy being used by data centers in the state. Those reports will be required to include information on the source of the energy and be made public. Water utilities in the state will also be required to publicly report when a single customer will account for more than 25% of the total water usage in the district. 
The data center companies would be required to pay an annual fee to the Department of Administration, which will put that money towards renewable energy programs. Data center buildings would also be required to obtain sustainability certifications. 
The bill would also give data centers an incentive to encourage utility companies to expand clean energy and it would also require the PSC to establish a class of “very large customers” and ensure that normal ratepayers aren’t bearing the increased energy costs caused by the data centers’ growing energy demands. 
“It’s mind-blowing that the only regulations we have on the books are to just incentivize data centers with no expectations for them being good environmental partners with the communities they’re going to be located in,” says Jen Giegerich, the government affairs director at Wisconsin Conservation Voters, which was involved in helping draft the proposal. 
“It’s really important that what this bill does is actually make sure that the data centers are paying their own way,” Giegerich continues. “We’ve just seen energy costs rising, and the fact that we would continue to put costs for energy development for tech giants who are making unheard-of profits, and then expecting Wisconsin ratepayers to pay for that is really a problem. So this bill rectifies that, and I think it’s sorely needed.”
The proposal also includes labor requirements for data center construction. Under the bill, any workers at construction sites for data centers must be paid the local prevailing wage rate or, if the worker is a member of a union, the wage rate in that worker’s collective bargaining agreement. The data center company will have to pay whichever wage is higher. 
To qualify for the sales tax exemptions already available for data centers under current state law, the companies would be required to meet the labor requirements in the bill and source at least 70% of their energy from renewable sources. 
Steve Kwaterski, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council, says data center projects have already been a source of consistent, good paying construction jobs for his members and the bill will go towards ensuring that these jobs support families in the state. 
“We want to make sure that any project that’s as complex as a data center is being done with the most skilled and trained workforce that’s out there,” he says. “That ensures that it’s being done right on time, on budget, and done safely as well.”

(Photo provided by Administrative Office of the Courts)Kentucky Supreme Court Chief Justice Debra Lambert is asking the state’s legislature to greenlight more funding to improve judicial employees’ pay and court facilities across the state. 
Lambert, who became the state’s first female chief justice earlier this year, spoke to lawmakers on the Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary Thursday during her first State of the Judiciary address. The Kentucky General Assembly will return to Frankfort in January for the 2026 legislative session, which will include debate on the next two-year state budget. 
Throughout her address, Lambert called for a “better approach” to how the judicial branch is funded to shore up its operations for the future. Among her funding requests for the state’s judicial branch, Lambert is asking for a 15% pay raise for all judicial branch employees, which would mean a general fund increase of $37 million. She added that Kentucky judicial branch employees make about 17% less on average than executive branch counterparts. 
The chief justice said the judicial branch faces “serious challenges” when attracting and retaining qualified employees. 
“Successful attorneys may have previously chosen to take a cut in pay to serve as a judge because of the potential for good retirement benefits, but that doesn’t happen anymore,” she said. 
Kentucky general jurisdiction judges ranked 48th in pay in comparison to other states, according to the National Center for State Courts. 
Lambert also emphasized a need to better maintain court facilities across the state. Following April floods, some Kentucky courthouses sustained heavy damage, including the Franklin County Courthouse in the state capital of Frankfort. The Franklin courts system moved operations back into the courthouse in September, but flood remediation was still ongoing. The judicial branch is asking for a one-time funding request to offset more than $8.5 million in flood related damages in Franklin and Hardin counties. 
The chief justice also proposed that the judicial branch have a dedicated revenue source to support long-term technology needs, such as subscription software and courtroom audio and video systems. 
“We must ensure that our courts remain strong, stable and accessible for generations to come,” Lambert said. “But great optimism does not mean that we can ignore a very harsh reality.”
The budget for Kentucky’s judicial branch is now about 3% of the state’s General Fund budget, or more than $466 million. In comparison, the executive branch is 97% of the General Fund budget, or $16.8 billion. 
Additionally, Lambert requested that the judicial branch have early access to its reserve account to make up for a projected shortfall of roughly $14.3 million in the next fiscal year. The legislature must sign off on the request, even though the judiciary would access its own funds and would not require supplemental funds. 
Lambert also gave updates about various court programs to support Kentuckians in the court system. In particular, the Kentucky Judicial Commission on Mental Health has repeatedly heard that “our system is strained, but it can be repaired and improved,” Lambert said.Challenges described include transportation. For example, current rules around regional mental health hospital assignments can mean that a person who is suicidal doesn’t get taken to the closest hospital, like a person suffering a medical emergency would. Lambert said there is a need for “greater consistency, improve coordination and quicker access to treatment.” 
‘Do what we can do’

House Republican Whip Rep. Jason Nemes, of Middletown, said legislators will “do what we can do” to approve a pay raise for the judicial branch. He added that the General Assembly increased pay for general jurisdiction judges by 20% over four years to $156,000, but Kentucky has still fallen behind other states.
When responding to Nemes’ comments, Lambert added that she would like to expand resources for truancy prevention for students from the courts, such as a curriculum that judges can offer schools. About 25% of Kentucky students were chronically absent from school during the 2024-25 school year, according to data from the Kentucky Department of Education. 
Nemes then said that chronic absenteeism is an issue in Jefferson County Public Schools, which is the state’s largest public school district centered around the Louisville metro area. 
“I would note that Jefferson County Public Schools has 92,000 kids in it, and we have to do things differently for Jefferson County Public Schools. Because anybody who would say that we must treat JCPS the same as we treat Robertson County, which has 3,000 people in the entire county, I don’t think is understanding the real world,” Nemes said. “So, we have to regulate things that are different, and we hope that the court of justice understands that in cases that might be before it or might be coming before it.” 
The Supreme Court agreed to rehear oral arguments in one of those cases this year, where JCPS challenged a 2022 law that shifts power from the elected school board to the appointed superintendent. Justices narrowly voted to vacate a previous ruling and renew the case after the election of Justice Pamela Goodwine last year. 
Nemes published an op-ed in the Louisville Courier-Journal before the second round of oral arguments saying that the court’s next ruling “will not only determine the future of Jefferson County’s schools but could also unravel critical local policies that benefit urban, suburban and rural communities.” 
Though they didn’t address the committee Wednesday, Goodwine and Deputy Chief Justice Robert Conley were in the audience behind Lambert during the meeting.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SOJ_Chief-Justice-Lambert_110625-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-06 16:56:58.434930

(Main photo by Getty Images; logo courtesy the State of Iowa) A Polk County company is suing members of the Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board, alleging they unlawfully directed the company to remove campaign signs from its property in advance of this week’s school board elections.
Acco Unlimited Corporation and its owners are suing IECDB members James Albert, Elaine Olson, Jonathan Roos, Daniel Jessop and Leah Rodenberg, as well as the executive director of the IECDB, Erika Eckley, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
In addition to the corporation itself, the plaintiffs in the case include Cris Christenson and Connor Christenson, who are trustees of the trust that owns Acco’s real estate.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit alleges that Cris Christenson supported a slate of candidates in the Nov. 4, 2025, election for Johnston Community School District Board. The candidates backed by Cris Christenson included his son and co-plaintiff, Connor, and Alicia Penner and Patrick Green — all three of whom were defeated in Tuesday’s election.
To show his support for their campaigns, Cris Christenson placed campaign signs for the three on property that Acco Unlimited occupies within the school district. Sometime in mid-October, the lawsuit alleges, the IECDB staff contacted Cris Christenson to inform him it had received a complaint alleging signs that advocated for the election of school board candidates were on Acco’s corporate property — a potential violation of laws that restrict corporate backing of candidates.
According to the lawsuit, Cris Christenson explained that while the business is a for-profit company, the property is owned by a revocable trust controlled by the Christenson family. The IECDB staff allegedly responded by indicating that because a corporation occupies the property, the signs could not be displayed.
The IECDB staff also contacted Connor Christenson, Penner and Green to tell them to remove the signs from the Acco Unlimited property. According to the lawsuit, each of the three initially refused to do so, arguing that the IECDB had not adequately explained the legal basis for such a demand.
On Oct. 27, 2025, Eckley presented the issue to the board at a public meeting and asked for authorization to initiate a formal investigation, which the board provided. The next day, Acco and the three candidates removed their signs from the Acco Unlimited property, the lawsuit alleges.
Hours later, Eckley informed the board the signs had been removed. Albert proposed that the board issue a reprimand, noting that Cris Christenson and the three candidates had “defied” the board’s attorneys when first contacted about the violation, the lawsuit claims.
Albert’s subsequent motion to issue a reprimand and an accompanying warning of additional consequences for future violation was approved by the board without dissent.
As part of the lawsuit, Cris Christenson says the board’s actions deprived him “of his ability to advocate for candidates of his choice from property occupied by a corporation that he controls.”
His co-plaintiff, Connor Christenson, alleges the board deprived him of his ability to “communicate his message to potential voters and to associate himself with a well-regarded Johnston family business.”
In addition, the Acco Unlimited company claims the board deprived it of the ability to “associate with reputable candidates who will implement policies at the local level that they find agreeable.”
Although the 2025 school board election has now passed, the lawsuit claims all of the plaintiffs intend to engage in similar political activity in the future, including the 2026 primary and general elections.
Iowa laws specifies that campaign signs shall not be placed on “property owned, leased, or occupied by a prohibited contributor,” such as corporations, unless the sign advocates the passage or defeat of a ballot issue or is otherwise exempted by law. A separate section of the law bars corporations making any “monetary or in-kind contribution to a candidate or committee” except for a ballot-issue committee.
The lawsuit cites a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court case, Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission, which involved politically oriented speech by a corporate entity.
“The court has recognized that First Amendment protection extends to corporations,” the U.S. Supreme Court held in that case, adding that “political speech is indispensable to decision-making in a democracy, and this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than an individual.”
The lawsuit contends that under the Citizens United ruling, the question of whether advocacy for a candidate in the form of campaign signs is permitted “cannot turn on whether than advocacy is done by an individual or a corporate entity.”
The lawsuit also contends that the “restriction on placement of candidate signs on corporate occupied property does not further any governmental interest” and that the board has violated the First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs.
The Christensons and their company are represented in the lawsuit by Alan R. Ostergren of Iowa’s Kirkwood Institute, a self-described “conservative public-interest law firm.” The institute describes itself as “nonpartisan” and has been recognized by the IRS as a tax-exempt public charity.
The IECDB has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. Eckley declined to comment on the case, noting that she had yet to see a copy of the complaint.

Lahn launched his campaign in Belle Plaine at his family farm, according to a news release. He said he plans to emphasize strengthening rural communities, supporting anti-abortion measures and “making Iowa healthy again.”
The Republican candidate has some political experience, having worked for a member of the Colorado state senate and running campaigns for Republican candidates in Iowa. He also has worked for Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy group. Lahn, who has not previously held political office, emphasized his status as an outsider to Iowa politics and said he was backing the campaign with his own funds.

“I’m not a politician — I’m my own biggest donor, and I can’t be bought,” Lahn said in a statement. “I’m running for Governor because I believe we’re losing the Iowa we love — who we are as a people, our heritage, our culture.”
Lahn said his campaign would be focused on issues like supporting family farms, increasing border security and improving Iowa’s education system. His campaign website states he would “restore parents to their rightful place in education” and “keep ideology out of classrooms” as governor. He also said he would work to tackle large corporations’ influence on Iowans in industries like agriculture and pharmaceuticals.
“The people who built Iowa are being pushed aside by greed and corruption,” Lahn said. “Big ag and big pharma have rigged the system against farmers and poisoned our families for generations. When I’m Governor, we’ll sue them, break up their monopolies, and make them answer for what they’ve done to Iowa.”
Lahn is joining a field of candidates aiming to become the Iowa GOP candidate for governor in 2026 after Gov. Kim Reynolds announced she will not seek reelection. Other Republicans in the race include U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, Iowa Rep. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston, former director of the Iowa Department of Administrative Services Adam Steen and former state Rep. Brad Sherman. Iowa Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, has an “exploratory” committee for governor, but has not officially launched a campaign.
Democrats criticized Lahn’s campaign Thursday, with Democratic Governors Association spokesperson Izzi Levy saying, “if two’s company and three’s a crowd, Zach Lahn’s entrance into the five-man race for Iowa’s GOP nomination for governor is nothing short of a clown car.”
“Just like his opponents, Lahn’s toxic record includes opposing Medicaid expansion, championing plans to gut public education, and supporting tariffs that are jacking up costs on Iowa farmers,” Levy said in a statement. “And just like them, Lahn would continue the last decade of disastrous one-party leadership that has led to a failing economy, underfunded schools, widespread government corruption, and a ban on abortion that restricts women’s care before they even know they’re pregnant.”
Iowa Auditor Rob Sand and Julie Stauch, a former Democratic political operative, are running as Democratic candidates in the 2026 gubernatorial election.
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart also criticized Lahn, calling him “just another member of the gang of insiders that would continue Iowa down the wrong direction” in a statement.
“Iowans need new leadership that will solve some of our toughest challenges, not more tariffs, vouchers, and health care cuts from a staffer for Kim Reynolds’ favorite special interest group,” Hart said.

Josh Stein said in a news conference Thursday, Nov. 6, 2025 in Raleigh. “Because if [lawmakers] fail to do so, people are suffering. And it is unacceptable.” (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Gov. Josh Stein renewed his demand Thursday for North Carolina lawmakers to pass additional funding for Medicaid, calling a special legislative session more than a month after his administration slashed payments to providers.
Stein, a Democrat, has maintained that the Republican-led legislature needs to approve additional funding to reverse the cuts, which range from 3% to 10% across providers. But House and Senate leaders have thus far failed to come to an agreement on a funding package, while widely criticizing Stein for cutting rates.
The governor, in a press conference Thursday, further sharpened his criticism of lawmakers, saying they had “failed North Carolina and the people of North Carolina” and calling their inaction “shameful.”
“It is time to fund Medicaid,” Stein said. “Because if they fail to do so, people are suffering. And it is unacceptable.”
Stein is expected to issue a formal announcement of a special session, planned for Monday, Nov. 17. But it remains to be seen whether any substantive agreement will be reached; although lawmakers are scheduled to return to Raleigh that week, leaders in both chambers have signaled they are done with votes for the year.
Spokespeople for House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) and Senate Leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday.
North Carolina health officials, including state Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai, have said the state’s Medicaid program is underfunded by around $319 million. Stein has previously laid out three options for lawmakers: lay out $319 million for full funding, lay out $190 million to delay cuts through the new year, or allow the executive branch to tap into a reserve fund.
Both the House and Senate have separately approved plans to fund the program. In the House, one bill would have let the state dip into that reserve fund to delay cuts through the end of the year; another contains just language to fund Medicaid. The Senate’s proposal to fund the program also includes line items for rural health care and the N.C. Children’s hospital.

Those disagreements have led to a months-long standoff on the issue (as well as one on the broader state budget). Senate Republican leaders have called on the House to “stop playing politics and come to the negotiating table”; Hall has said he believes “[the House’s] bills are better.”
Stein said Thursday he had spoken to Hall and Berger last week about the issue. The conversation “didn’t go as well as I wanted it to go,” he said.
“Both chambers agree that we need more money, and how much money to get,” Stein said. “But what they cannot do is come to an agreement on a bill because of a dispute on an unrelated issue.
“I actually take the side of the Senate on [that issue],” he added. “But this is not the time or place to fight that fight.”
Republican leaders could choose to return to Raleigh and declare Stein’s special session unconstitutional. They did so in 2017, after former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper called on them to redraw legislative maps after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.
Democratic leaders in both the House and Senate issued statements in support of Stein’s special session call Thursday.
“It’s long past time for Republicans to stop playing games with people’s health,” Senate Democratic leader Sydney Batch (D-Wake) said.

The cuts mean health care providers are receiving less money to care for the 3.1 million North Carolinians enrolled in the program. Primary care doctors, dentists, hospitalizations, community care and nursing homes are all dependent on the program’s funding.
Stein and Sangvai were joined Thursday by two such enrollees and one family physician whose practice participates in Medicaid. Demi Eckhoff, a Medicaid participant who is also an advocate for people with disabilities, said the cuts put several support services she relies on at risk.

Nov. 6, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Lawmakers, religious leaders and anti-abortion activists rallied on the steps of the Michigan State Capitol on Thursday to call out what state Sen. John Damoose, a Harbor Springs Republican, referred to as “the devastation wrought by Proposal 3.”
The second “March for Life” rally, hosted by Right to Life of Michigan, was hosted on the anniversary of the passage of Proposal 3, the ballot initiative that enshrined the right to an abortion into Michigan’s state constitution. A release from Right to Life of Michigan estimated that thousands of people attended the event, which filled the lawn in front of the Capitol steps.
Damoose, as well as Jennie Bradley Lichter, the president of national organization March for Life, categorized the situation in Michigan as grim for anti-abortion activism. Lichter spoke to the “challenging legal, political, and cultural landscape here in Michigan,” while Damoose said, “the world does look very dim right now in the wake of Proposal 3.”
Organizers estimated that the March for Life rally attracted “thousands” of anti-abortion supporters. Nov. 6, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.
A lawsuit to overturn Proposal 3, filed by Right to Life of Michigan and others, was dismissed last month by Judge Paul Maloney of the U.S. District Court Western District of Michigan’s Southern Division, though plaintiffs have filed an appeal in the case in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. 
Speakers at Thursday’s rally largely centered their speeches around shifting narratives around abortions and providing pregnant people with information about alternatives to abortions. One of the main calls was support for Pregnancy Resource Centers. Those organizations, also known as crisis pregnancy centers, have been criticized by many reproductive rights advocates for providing misleading, often religious-influenced information to discourage people from seeking abortions. 
“You can get an abortion now with no regard for your safety, and there are no physical or psychological consequences,” said Angi Lok, a nurse at the Pregnancy Resource Center of Grand Rapids. “We, the PRCs, are empowering women with knowledge to take a moment, a breath, a pause, to have the opportunity to make an informed life decision. And when women are supported and informed, most often they choose life.”
Amber Roseboom, president of Right to Life of Michigan, similarly characterized her organization’s work as seeking to support pregnant individuals. 
“We stand with, not against women facing unplanned pregnancies,” she said. “We offer compassion, the truth and love, hope, including the practical care and support to make a choice for life.”

But abortion advocates pushed back against the idea that people are being pressured into abortions. Jex Blackmore, a founding member of the Hydra Mutual Aid Fund, a mutual aid project supporting abortion access in Michigan, called those categorizations “a fabricated crisis to rationalize restricting access to care that is proven to be safe and necessary.”
“It is a condescending and cynical approach that treats the public as unable to understand their own medical decisions and attempts to replace personal autonomy with political ideology,” they wrote. “It is deeply disrespectful to the people whose lives and health are actually at stake.”
Lichter also announced during the rally a package of three bills, introduced on Tuesday in the state House of Representatives, that are seeking to re-introduce reporting requirements for abortion providers that were eliminated in early 2024. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Your pro-life Michigan representatives just filed three bills that would reestablish reporting requirements about abortions obtained in Michigan, and about the complications that result from them,” she said. “This proposed legislation is so important. It would not only provide women with important information about the risk of abortion, but would demand transparency and accountability from big abortion. Women have a right to know about the rates and types of serious complications, especially given the shocking recent 38% increase in serious abortion complications initiated.”
That statistic cited by Lichter originates from a misleading 2021 analysis published by the Charlotte Lozier Institute, an anti-abortion think tank, according to Blackmore. 
“Peer reviewed population-level studies consistently find that serious complications from medication abortion occur in well under 1 percent of cases, placing it among the safest medical interventions in routine clinical care,” Blackmore added. “Major medical organizations, including ACOG [American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists] and the WHO [World Health Organization], affirm this evidence.”
Despite the new legislation being introduced, Damoose’s remarks were not focused on legislative action at either the federal or state level. 
“This has never been just a political battle. It’s a moral and spiritual battle,” he told the crowd. “Our mission has shifted from trying to pass a policy to where it probably should have been from the beginning and where it has been for many of you all along. And that is building a culture of life so strong that legal or not, people would never even dream of taking an innocent life.”

Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) also made an appearance at the rally to discuss federal legislation, including the “Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act,” a House bill that he has supported. In telling the crowd to call for Michigan’s senators to vote for it, he also jabbed to say, “while you’re at it, maybe ask them to open the government up, too.”

Lok, like many of the speakers, criticized pro-choice rhetoric for being misleading to pregnant people. 
“Their deception is centered around the mother. ‘My body, my choice’ being one example,” she said, referring to a common pro-choice slogan. 
Similarly, Mayra Rodriguez, a former Planned Parenthood Arizona administrator who won a wrongful termination lawsuit in 2019 after reporting her concerns about unsafe medical practices in the clinic, told the crowd, “Abortion does not empower women. It wants them, it changes them in silence.”
“What occurred at the March for Life event was not a good faith conversation about health. It was an orchestrated effort to weaponize misinformation in order to frighten the public,” Blackmore noted. “This is not medically or intellectually serious.” 
The event concluded with a march to Michigan’s Hall of Justice.

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — New Kansas businesses with demanding electricity requirements will be subject to additional costs and restrictions after the Kansas Corporation Commission approved a large-load tariff Thursday morning. 
Evergy applied earlier this year to the state’s regulatory body to create a large-load tariff that would mitigate the effect of such users on other customers. 
After numerous filings and negotiations among convenors, including environmental organizations, a data center association and school districts, the tariff affects new businesses using more than 75 megawatts of peak load energy per month.
Existing businesses that increase their pull on the system by 75 megawatts per month will also come under the tariff, said Brian Fedotin, the KCC staff member who summarized the bill for the three-member commission. 
All convenors unanimously approved the tariff and on Thursday, it received unanimous approval from the KCC.  
The final order sets multiple requirements for large-load users, including a minimum contract term of 12 years, plus an optional five-year period as the company ramps up, Fedotin said. 
It also requires those customers to pay a minimum of 80% of their contract, even in months where they don’t use that much electricity, and to post collateral for two years of minimum bills. 
In Evergy’s third-quarter earnings call Thursday morning, CEO and president David Campbell said the company projects 2% to 3% load growth by 2029 with current customers, including big customers like Panasonic. That projection may increase to 4% to 5% load growth if negotiations for two data center projects come to fruition, he said.
In addition, Campbell said, there’s an additional data center project in the works and multiple customers that would represent about 2 to 3 additional gigawatts of peak demand. They were not included in the 4% to 5% forecast, he said, so demand could increase. 
“Overall, we continue to see an incredible level of interest in our service territory,” Campbell said on the call. “We’re making progress with potential new large customers across all phases of discussion. Each category reflects potential new entrants that will empower growth, investment and drive prosperity for our region.”
Evergy spokeswoman Gina Penzig said any new business coming on line with projections of 75 megawatts of load would be subject to the tariff, but there could be exceptions. 
“These tariffs will apply to any new load expected to be 75MW or greater unless certain state incentives are offered to new prospective customers, which in that case could lead to a special contract,” she said. 
In September, Evergy executive vice president of utility operations Chuck Caisley called Kansas’ design of its large-load tariff “a model” for other states because it seeks to distribute costs without affecting small businesses and residential customers.
The Sierra Club was represented in the docket by Great Rivers Environmental Law Center and signed the unanimous agreement, although the organization still has concerns. 
Sarah Rubenstein, a Great Rivers staff attorney, said without the tariff and clear protections, families and small businesses could foot the bill for data centers and other large load users. 
“This settlement ensures that large energy users share responsibility for the infrastructure they require while also creating new opportunities to move the grid toward clean, renewable energy,” she said. 
Sierra Club supported changes in Evergy’s original tariff proposal during the negotiations, such as decreasing the threshold from 100 megawatts to 75 megawatts and allowing large-load customers to shape climate goals through Evergy’s integrated resource plan, the organization said in a news release. 
Sierra Club’s statement said it is concerned because Evergy is delaying coal plant retirements and building natural gas plants to meet energy demands. 
“Evergy is going in the wrong direction by delaying coal plant retirements that are increasingly expensive and less reliable, but we joined this agreement alongside tech companies and the utility because it places reasonable protections on existing customers while enabling new investments in clean energy,” said Ty Gorman, Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign senior organizing strategist.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/KCC-building-1024x584.jpg,,,2025-11-06 16:02:38.106389

But the distribution on the first Thursday of November occurred after the disruption to federal food benefits, and surpassed the high need volunteers already see on a regular basis.
According to Amanda Bregel, The Food Depot’s communications director, the first distribution last month served 595 households. The last October event—when people had heard about the possible forthcoming halt to benefits through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program—served 662. Thursday’s distribution served 743 households, she said—nearly 3,000 individuals.

The United States Department of Agriculture initially announced they would not be providing SNAP benefits until the federal shutdown ended. Two federal judges last week blocked the Trump administration from not paying the benefits, but even as of Thursday, litigation over the issue continued, as the USDA acknowledged it had miscalculated the decreased benefits it would be paying.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced at the end of October the state would distribute $30 million through emergency declarations to compensate for SNAP, the equivalent of approximately 10 days worth of benefits. The governor also said during a news conference announcing the funding that another special legislative session to address the rest of the month could happen.
In the meantime, food banks in Albuquerque and Las Cruces also have reported higher numbers of people showing up for food distributions.
The Food Depot serves people in nine counties and has 85 different partners, such as schools, churches and other nonprofits. Bregel told Source NM on Thursday that “every single agency that ordered last week ordered more food than they ever have before. So everybody is needing more support for their distributions.”
At the same time, she noted, donations also have increased, both food and monetary ones.
“We are really excited that people are supporting us with food, but also funds, which help us purchase more food,” she said. “Because we’re purchasing so much more food than we usually do. We’ve purchased like three months of food in just the past week or two.”

Monica Garcia came to the food distribution for the first time on Thursday. A single mother, she said, the SNAP upheaval “is really tough on me right now. It’s just really hard and stressful, me working 40 hours a week and dividing my time with my kid and work. Now that they cut our SNAP, sometimes I don’t know what to do.”

In anticipation of more attendees, they would distribute for three, rather than the usual two hours.

Montoya started volunteering with The Food Depot during the COVID-19 pandemic when she saw distributions in her community on the San Ildefonso Pueblo. “That just kind of opened my eyes,” Montoya said, “like, ‘wow, I can actually help.'”
The work is rewarding, she said, “just going home and knowing that someone has food at their table at the end of the night.” And while the current SNAP problems are upsetting to clients and staff: “We are doing our best to stay positive and help our clients through this hard time.”
Paige Rodriguez, one of The Food Depot’s clients, came through Thursday morning with her 5-year-old son in the back seat. “It’s hard,” she said, choking back tears. “It’s hard to keep a roof over your head right as it is. I really struggle…but I’m just trying to get through it.”
Bregel said in response to the current heightened need, The Food Depot is also providing pop-up emergency distributions each week. The organization has an online interactive map where people can find food near their locations.
Program coordinator Diego Salinas bagged lettuce with volunteer Patty Karlovitz on Thursday and remarked that the large distributions “feels like the culmination of all our work, everybody’s work, in all our different departments.”
Volunteers greeted car after car, wishing everyone a good morning, smiling, and filling their cars with a variety of fresh and pantry foods. “It’s nice to sort of see the clients smiling, to interact with them,” Salinas said. “It’s really joyous work.”
Karlovitz added: “When you’re 83 years old, you think you don’t have anything to offer anymore, but you have this.”
Thursday marked Steven Freemire’s first day volunteering at the distribution, though he had helped pack food at The Food Depot before. “I thought it would be a wonderful opportunity to actually give food directly to people,” he said. “All the more so now.”
Even so, he noted. “I was really shocked to see the line of cars, how many people were waiting. It’s very moving to be that much more aware of the need out there.”

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Tuesday’s municipal elections across Montana featured six mayoral contests in the state’s largest cities.
While a couple featured incumbent candidates, residents in several cities will have new executives in office in the near future. All of Montana’s mayoral races are nonpartisan.
Here’s a short roundup of the changes in city halls across the state. All results are considered unofficial.
Kalispell
In the state’s fastest growing city, Ryan Hunter, an incumbent city councilor supported by the Flathead County Democrats, won a three-way race against Republican-endorsed Kisa Davison and Sid Daoud, former chair of the Montana Libertarian Party. Hunter campaigned heavily on pushing for fair and responsible growth in the city, addressing the housing and homelessness crisis, and bolstering walkability and open spaces.
Helena
In the capital city, two sitting city commissioners with roots in Democratic politics faced off to replace Mayor Wilmot Collins, who served in the role since 2018.
Emily Dean held a 203-vote lead over Andy Shirtliff according to the county’s unofficial votes, a reverse of the results of the city’s primary election, which saw Shirtliff prevail. Dean was endorsed by Collins and city commissioner Sean Logan.
Billings
With Billings Mayor Bill Cole on his way out of office, two city council members, a local businessman and a young, political newcomer vied for the open seat to lead the state’s largest municipality.
Unofficial results show hotel owner and developer Mike Nelson with a 185-vote lead over city councilor Jennifer Owen, who has a background in law and community development. Montana’s automatic recount law kicks in at a victory of less than 0.5%, and the Nelson’s lead is roughly 0.6%.
The narrow lead could change as the county elections department deals with rejected ballots that voters were able to fix on Wednesday, and counts provisional ballots.
Missoula
Missoula Mayor Andrea Davis has been in office since winning a special election in 2023 to serve out former Mayor John Engen’s term after he died in 2022.
Davis won her first full four-year term this week over Shawn Knopp by roughly 38 percentage points. Davis said she was running for re-election to work to implement new land-use and zoning regulations to work on housing affordability in the city, as well as prioritizing sustainability and a clean environment.
Knopp had run on a platform of changing the status quo, increasing fiscal responsibility and addressing high property taxes.
Bozeman
The City of Bozeman has a unique governing system where mayors are elected two years out from when they begin their term, and serve as deputy mayor in the interim.
City Commissioner Douglas Fisher took a commanding lead over environmental lawyer John Meyer and a political neophyte Brendan O’Connor with 61.5% of the vote. Fisher was endorsed by six former and current mayors, including current Mayor Terry Cunningham and Deputy (and soon-to-be) Mayor Joey Morrison.
Great Falls
Great Falls was the only big city with a full-term incumbent mayor running for reelection. Mayor Cory Reeves, first elected in 2023, won his second term with 72.5% of the vote. He has drawn on his background in law enforcement working for both the Great Falls Police Department and the Cascade County Sheriff’s Office.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/montana-election-day-2024-5-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-06 16:02:38.106389

He said rates for CFI caretakers are so low it makes it nearly impossible to get the care he needs. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)It costs the state of New Hampshire roughly three times more to place someone with physical disabilities or older adults in a nursing home than it does to pay for in-home care, according to evidence presented in an ongoing court case. More importantly, most of these people want to stay in their own homes.
Still, many who take advantage of the state’s Choices for Independence program, which provides this type of in-home care, say the program is so lackluster due to state underinvestment it’s forcing many of them into nursing homes.
The state of the CFI program is at the heart of a civil lawsuit filed in 2021 by a group of nonprofits that has since expanded to a massive class-action suit. A trial in federal court could begin next year.
A program in disarray
Dan Hebert, a Concord software engineer who uses a wheelchair because of his disability, is a CFI participant and a member of the plaintiff class.
“I’m 43 years old,” Hebert said. “I want to say I’m just like you. Career, hopes, dreams, family, friends, hobbies, you know, the life that we all want to live and lead. And by accident of birth, I’m here and you’re there, so, yeah, I don’t want to go to a nursing home.”
CFI provides people with physical disabilities and older adults who want to live at home the care they need to make that happen using Medicaid funds. To be eligible for the program, participants must have a medical condition that qualifies for residential care at a nursing home. Roughly 5,000 people participate in the program and in 2024 the state paid $111 million for their care, the state said in court filings.
For Hebert, the state puts money into an account that’s managed by a payroll company. Hebert hires caretakers to help him with his daily life and the payroll company pays those caretakers. He said the rates the state allows him to pay caregivers is so low it makes hiring close to impossible. He’s had a vacancy for one of his caregivers since April. His ads get few calls. He has no-shows for interviews. People mislead him about their criminal records. Without caretakers, Hebert is unable to get out of bed in the morning, feed himself, or use the restroom. When Hebert doesn’t have a caretaker, it means he has to wait.
“You can just run into that bathroom when your stomach rumbles,” Hebert said. “Me? I’m looking at the clock. That’s my reality.”
Without caretakers, Hebert is stuck in his wheelchair or bed, something that if done for too long, results in bed sores and other health complications. He said he’s had to go to the hospital because of the sores as well as digestive issues due to not being able to get to the restroom.
Ideally, a caretaker comes four times a day, he said, to help him get ready in the morning, for meals and bathroom trips during the day, and again at bedtime. He said keeping that schedule is often impossible with his staffing issues.
He doesn’t have any ill will towards caretaker who quit because of low pay or have to call in sick, he said. He knows the rates are too low.
“Caregiving is a team,” he said. “Everyone that works for me has their own life, their own challenges, family, health issues, whatever is going on for them and they’re taking time out of their day to come over to my house to get me out of bed in the morning.”
Hebert said the situation needs to be “symbiotic.”
”The healthiest caregiving situations I’ve ever had were the ones where it worked for both of us,” he said. “I think it’s hard not to care from both sides. Like, they care about me, about my well-being, and I do too for them.”
Hebert said he doesn’t “think they’re (DHHS officials) bad people.” He just “fundamentally disagrees” with them.
A five-year legal battle
The case has been playing out in federal court since January 2021, when two CFI participants sued the state. In 2023, U.S. District Court Judge Paul Barbadoro certified the case as a class-action, opening the door for many more CFI participants, including Hebert, to join in. On Oct. 29, Barbadoro heard a series of arguments from both sides asking him to end the case with a pre-trial ruling — or at least rule on a couple of issues. Early on in the hearing though, Barbadoro made it clear that he wasn’t going to “rubber stamp” the case.
The CFI participants are represented by a coalition of nonprofits including the AARP Foundation, the Disability Rights Center-NH, New Hampshire Legal Assistance, and the private law firm Nixon Peabody. Attorneys argue that because of a lack of funding and support for the CFI program the state is putting people at risk of being institutionalized in a nursing home, a violation of their rights under the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act.
Meanwhile, the state has hired boutique Washington, D.C. law firm Brown & Peisch to represent DHHS alongside its in-house counsel. In last week’s hearing, the attorneys argued the court can penalize DHHS only when people are actually institutionalized or “on the precipice” of institutionalization. DHHS’ attorneys argued anything more was going beyond what Congress mandated in the ADA.
Barbadoro cast doubt on this assertion, arguing that it is too vague.
“So super serious risk of institutionalization?” he said. “That would be your standard?”
The judge also expressed frustration with what he sees as a lack of specificity from the plaintiffs, telling them any potential order he issues will include specific demands of DHHS and he wants them to offer specific ideas for those demands.
In an interview with the Bulletin, lead counsel for the AARP Foundation and the plaintiffs Kelly Bagby pushed back on the idea that they haven’t been specific.
“I think that the judge has just not focused on it,” Bagby said. “But when you look at the actual injunction we have, there’s like 15 sub parts of what they have to do.”
Most of all, the plaintiffs want DHHS to undergo a thorough review of the program, the rates they pay providers, and what it would take to meet the needs of CFI participants.
Still, Bagby thinks the judge understands the issues they argue are plaguing the program.
DHHS’ attorneys referred the Bulletin to the Attorney General’s Office for questions. Michael Garrity, spokesperson for the office, declined to answer the Bulletin’s questions on the case. DHHS acknowledged in court there is a staffing shortage in the program. Still, it wouldn’t elaborate on whether it has plans to address that shortage independent of a court order.
Barbadoro will need to review a series of motions from both parties, but he warned the process could take months, especially given a slew of immigration-related cases that are inundating the courts. After that, if the judge doesn’t give summary judgement, a trial could take place in 2026.
“This is already five years old,” he said. “I want to resolve it.”’
If DHHS is forced to comply, will lawmakers get on board?
Even if the judge orders a rate analysis and DHHS complies, the department would still need lawmakers’ support to implement a rate adjustment. The Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee — a panel of lawmakers from both the House and Senate — would need to approve a transfer within DHHS to the CFI program. If DHHS doesn’t have the money to transfer, a funding bill would need to be approved by the House, Senate, and Gov. Kelly Ayotte.
The plaintiffs are confident that their proposal for DHHS would be enough for the department to persuade lawmakers.
“You need to educate the Legislature about why this is essential,” Bagby said. “And if they make it clear to the Legislature that it is essential for the citizens of New Hampshire, if they get whatever it is that the court is ordering, then they’ll do it. But, I mean, you have to make the argument. It’s part of the process.”
Indeed, the Legislature has given rate hikes before. In 2023, it increased rates across several Medicaid programs, including CFI, by roughly $134 million in that year’s budget.
Meanwhile, CFI participants continue to deal with the program’s challenges. Hebert said he understands “this is how the sausage is made.”
“The issues that they talk about in this lawsuit are happening all the time, and they have over the duration of this lawsuit, and for however long this goes on,” Hebert said, “There’s frustration, for sure, but I understand it’s a process, and if this can fix it, it’ll be worth it.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/hebertcfi-1024x709.jpg,,,2025-11-06 16:02:38.106389

(Credit: Michael Moline)Former House Speaker and Republican gubernatorial hopeful Paul Renner is calling for Congress to eliminate the Affordable Care Act and for the Florida Legislature to nix “medical vaccine mandates” and prohibit patients who refuse to be vaccinated from being excluded or segregated  from others.
While Florida leads the nation in enrollment in the federal health exchange with more than 4.6 million residents relying on the marketplace (healthcare.gov) for their insurance, Renner, called the law a failure and said its caused the costs of health care to skyrocket.
“I think the key thing is government can, and obviously does, is to go in to help people financially when they need it. Where we get in trouble is when government tries to run things or they over regulate, and that’s the problem with Obamacare,” Renner told the Florida Phoenix in a phone interview.
“Health care costs have gone up since Obamacare, more than inflation, and more than even wages. And that latter part is the problem. It’s that people can’t afford Obamacare. They can’t afford it anymore, which is why then, Congress is looking at more and more subsidies. So the solution is not to keep subsidizing.”
Renner told the Phoenix that when he was in the Legislature he was enrolled in the state group health insurance plan which itself is heavily subsidized by taxpayers while premiums have been kept at the same level for years.
Renner’s platform, dubbed the “Florida Health Freedom and Wellness Initiative,” addresses four broad policy areas: protecting medical freedom; increasing safety and transparency;  parental rights and healthy schools; and community wellness and preventative care. Under each umbrella topic, Renner lists the ways he plans on achieving his objectives if elected Florida’s next governor.
Renner faces U.S. Congressman Byron Donalds in the Republican primary, who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump.  Donalds is on the record opposing the ACA, but, unlike Renner, he has not released a health care platform. And health care isn’t included in a list of  seven issues posted on Donalds’ campaign website.
Renner supports Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo’s call to eliminate vaccine mandates, though the issue hasn’t gained any traction in the Florida Legislature to date and is not supported by all Republicans.
Renner’s health care platform goes further, ending what he calls “medical mandates for vaccines” and prohibiting exclusion or segregation of patients based on vaccination status. That also is an issue the DeSantis administration supports and worked, albeit unsuccessfully, to pass during the 2025 session.
No vax, no mask, but still service

The push to require physicians to treat all patients fell short after several senators raised concerns, including Sen. Gayle Harrell, who said the move could expose physicians to greater liability. Sen. Jason Pizzo also cried fowl and said the requirement contradicted a law (passed under Renner’s term as House speaker) that guarantees Florida physicians legal protections to not treat patients on the basis of their conscience.

The group Stand for Health Freedom praised Renner’s platform.
“Paul Renner’s Florida Health Freedom and Wellness Initiative embodies what Stand for Health Freedom has championed from the start: empowering parents, restoring transparency, and promoting personal responsibility in health policy. It takes vision and conviction to set moral boundaries around public health authority,” Leah Wilson, co-founder and executive director for Stand for Health Freedom said in a prepared statement. “Renner has both and will work tirelessly to secure a brighter, freer, and healthier future for our children.”
Included under parental rights and healthy schools category includes proposals to remove harmful additives from school meals, expand local farm-to-school purchasing, restore student fitness standards, and promote active childhood development.
That section also includes a proposal to “end all unnecessary medical and mental health interventions performed on minors without prior parental consent, both inside and outside of schools.”
“I applaud Paul Renner for his steadfast commitment to parental rights. With Paul Renner as governor, Florida will continue to respect and uphold the fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing, care, and education of their children. I look forward to working with
him to protect and strengthen Florida families,” Patti Sullivan, state coordinator for Parental Rights Florida said in a statement.
Specific to community wellness and preventive care Renner says he wants to expand Medicaid patients’ access to chiropractic, naturopathic, nutritional, and integrative medicine medicine. He also said he wants to establish a Florida “Whole Health Advisory Council” to coordinate chronic disease prevention. Also included under the community wellness and preventive care category is “promoting clean water, toxin-free spaces, regenerative agriculture, and local food systems.”
Renner also said he wants to support workplace wellness programs and healthier environments for state employees.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-06 20:21:59+00:00,CT Mirror,Replacing Whiting Forensic Hospital could cost $700M. Now what?,Emilia Otte and Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/06/whiting-forensic-hospital-proposed-design/,"A task force concluded the facility was in desperate need of replacement. Lamont set aside $50M, but a recommended design would cost $700M.","Patients at Whiting Forensic Hospital in Middletown have a long list of complaints about their living quarters: unhygienic conditions and mice, the closure of the woodworking shop and vegetable garden, frustrations about staff behavior and a lack of privacy. 
State leaders are working to address some of those shortcomings. But it’s been a deliberate process. 
A state task force, convened in 2019 to investigate complaints at Whiting, concluded that the facility was in desperate need of replacement. The task force recommended the construction of a new building — one that would “promote recovery and healing” and provide long-term care in a modern and secure setting. In the state’s fiscal year 2026 budget, Gov. Ned Lamont set aside $50 million in design costs toward a replacement for Whiting. 
Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, co-chair of the legislature’s Public Health Committee, said that the new facility was a critical next step in addressing issues raised by the task force. “This is a necessary responsibility of the state to address these issues,” Anwar said. The new Whiting facility should be “reflective of the current times, a safe and healing environment,” he said.
But efforts to replace the old facility — a cramped, aging building from the 1970s that was planned by an architect who designed prisons — appear to have hit a roadblock. 
An architectural firm hired by the state to study the best option for a new hospital has recommended a design that would cost the state $700 million.
The plan, which would involve razing the former Connecticut Juvenile Training School in Middletown and constructing an entirely new 246-bed facility, offered several benefits. According to Page Southerland Page Inc., the firm contracted to perform the study, the new plan would make it possible to keep patients in one space, without having to transport them outside the facility; it would create more efficiency for staff and allow for private bedrooms and green spaces for patients.

But the price tag was more than state budget officials were comfortable with spending. They have now asked the design firm to conduct a new study in search of a less-expensive middle ground — potentially reusing portions of the former training school buildings rather than knocking them all down for a new building.
A spokesperson for Lamont did not respond to requests for comment in time for publication.
Christopher McClure, spokesperson for the state Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, said no option has been taken off the table yet, and it will ultimately be up to the state’s executive and legislative branches to make the final determination. 
Whiting CEO Joe Crego said he supports conducting the new study. “It’s going to give a lot of options, and ultimately the optimum way to utilize taxpayer dollars to build the best facility possible,” he said.

Ongoing problems
The shoddy conditions in Whiting Forensic Hospital have come under the scrutiny of state lawmakers for nearly a decade. 
An abuse scandal in 2017, in which Whiting staff were videotaped physically and psychologically torturing patient William Shehadi, Jr., shocked the public. Staff members abused Shehadi over an extended period, and dozens were found to either be involved in or aware of the abuse. 
The case also led to the state legislature’s creation of the task force that was charged with evaluating conditions at the forensic hospital and making recommendations for improvements. Members were appointed by state lawmakers and included advocates and experts.
The task force’s inquiry included hearings with patients, a tour of the Whiting building, and meetings with patient advocates, staff members and the Psychiatric Security Review Board — a group of mental health professionals and criminal justice experts charged with determining whether it is safe for a patient to transition from the hospital back into the community.
Patients who spoke to the task force described a lack of educational programs and 12-step recovery groups; staffing shortages and quality-of-life concerns like cold showers; and cockroaches in the building. A 2019 report from Disability Rights Connecticut found that the facility had inadequate treatment plans for patients, used restraints as a form of discipline and was overreliant on psychotropic medication. 
The report the task force released in 2021 described the facility as being in “poor condition” and outlined numerous safety concerns. And the task force concluded that opportunities for learning, recovery and vocational advancement were more apparent in the state’s correctional facilities than at Whiting — despite the fact that Whiting is, by its nature, not a punitive environment but rather intended to help people recover from illnesses that are preventing them from successfully rejoining society.
The task force ultimately recommended exploring options for constructing a new building — one that would “promote recovery and healing” and provide long-term care in a modern and secure setting.
Sen. Heather Somers, R-Groton, has been an advocate for improvements at Whiting since the Shehadi abuse came to light, and she has visited the facility multiple times. 
“It’s not a facility that would encourage wellness,” Somers said. “I could see it actually going the other way, being detrimental.” 
Somers said the history of abuse and the long slog to funding a new facility was important context for the public to be aware of as they watched a significant amount of money be set aside — $50 million by Lamont in the state’s fiscal year 2026 budget for design costs toward the replacement of Whiting, and likely hundreds of millions more for construction in coming years. 
The decision to invest in Whiting is not coming out of nowhere, she said, but from revelations of dangerous conditions over many years of inquiry. 
“We have to recognize that we have to spend money to protect and serve those who are the most vulnerable,” Somers said. “I think that this is one of the most vulnerable populations that we have.” She also pointed to the costliness of litigation for the state, which paid out $9 million in a legal settlement with Shehadi’s family.

Not enough space
Staff and patients suggested many improvements needed at Whiting, but one, Crego said, was key: more space. 
Steve Morgan, a patient at Whiting, said the lack of space can irritate patients with paranoia and other mental health issues. “People get amped up,” Morgan said. 
Whiting serves three groups of patients — people who have committed a crime and been found not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI); people who have been arrested but found not competent to stand trial; and people who have not been accused of any crime but who have been deemed too mentally unstable to rejoin the community. 
For all patients, it’s important that the environment be therapeutic. And that’s often not the way it goes.
Crego said patients at the maximum security facility, for example, move up and down a single hallway when they need to traverse the building — an arrangement that became problematic during the COVID pandemic. While there’s a courtyard in the center, patients aren’t able to see much beyond the tops of trees.
“There’s not a lot of room,” Crego said. That can be a problem when a patient is upset, he said. “One of the biggest de-escalators is just to allow someone who’s upset space,” Crego said. 
It’s also a safety hazard, Crego explained: if someone starts behaving violently, having space allows that person to calm down naturally rather than having to step in and physically restrain the person. 
“There’s a lot of studies that show that 30 minutes of physical activity a day for any one of us — it’s almost better than an antidepressant or an anti-anxiety medication,” Crego explained. “So for someone with a pretty significant serious mental health issue, the ability to have more space in and of itself is therapeutic.” 
If the state moves forward with the CJTS site in Middletown, Crego said it might be possible to reuse some of the buildings that already existed, which would save some money. And there are opportunities to add programs at the site.
Crego said the facility’s larger building, located next to the football field, already has a training kitchen, treatment areas and places for school and vocational training. Another plus is the “mirrored spaces” in the building, which allow residents to see others on the opposite side. 
“If we’re able to show a patient who’s here in [maximum security] and is working on this side of that building that, hey, there’s another side … that I can be able to get a job working in the kitchen and start to work my way out, it instills that sense of hope, which is so important for all of us as human beings,” Crego said.
There are some areas that would have to be revamped, Crego said, particularly the sleeping areas. The dorms at the training school were set up like cells, not like hospital rooms, and were designed for children rather than adults.  
Crego said patients were given a great deal of input during the study — they were part of work groups, on steering committees and in policy groups. 
“Some of our folks, unfortunately, stay here for quite some time. So we want to make sure that they’re able to have some input into their homes,” Crego said. 
The task force’s study presented some alternative options, like the construction of a smaller 102-bed facility or the renovation of Dutcher Hall, the current building housing lower-security patients. But those options have some key drawbacks, including the need to transport patients and distribute food between two buildings, and the space limitations present at Dutcher Hall.  
Somers was skeptical of whether a renovation of existing buildings at CJTS would ultimately deliver the necessary cost savings. As a perennial renovator of older homes and as a former mayor who oversaw the renovation of local schools, Somers said that she’s learned over the years that costs are usually far more than anticipated because of unexpected problems. 
“I don’t know of any renovation that has ever come in under budget,” she said. “Sometimes it’s more cost effective to just build new, and I hate to say that, but that’s the reality of what I faced.”
Ultimately, she said, building a new facility would allow the state to have more control and create the environment of healing that is the end goal.

A new building can’t fix everything
In order for Whiting to improve care and operations, staff, patients and state officials say it will take more than just new space. 
Representatives from the hospital and the state Department of Administrative Services said natural light was key, and they proposed things like a cafe that would be open to community members, a chapel, a room for art therapy and woodworking, a comfortable visiting area, places where they could host outdoor activities like cookouts and basketball games, and vocational programs that would serve patients when they’re released into the wider communities. 
A key priority was creating a facility that would be clearly focused on recovery and that would prepare patients for a successful return for their communities. They said they wanted to decrease the stigma associated with the facility and improve understanding from the general public.
Staff also said that while a new building has been promised for years — and repairs were “long overdue” — that wouldn’t magically fix some of the systemic problems plaguing the institution. 
“Our job is to care for your loved ones during their most vulnerable moments. Yet, we’re understaffed, not properly supported, and lacking the equipment to do the jobs we were trained to do. Morale is low because leadership isn’t listening,” said Rob Baril, president of SEIU 1199 NE, the union representing workers at Whiting Forensic Hospital, in a statement. 
“If this is really about improving care, it must start with treating staff with respect, hiring enough people, and committing to real oversight,” he added. “A new building means nothing without a new approach.” 
Whiting has struggled with large numbers of employees suffering injuries at the workplace that take them out of work for a period of time, leaving their colleagues to work mandated overtime shifts, sometimes for days on end.
Patients say that even without a new building, there are things the administration could change at the current hospital to make life better for the residents. 
For example, Morgan mentioned the mice problem and suggested improving the food, which has few fresh vegetables, or reducing the excessively bright lighting in the hallways. Morgan said that among the most healing places at Whiting was a vegetable garden in the courtyard that no longer exists. “It was one of the most positive things, I think it was appreciated by everyone — patients and staff,” he said.
Aaron Ramsey, also a patient at Whiting, said that privacy was a key issue, and questioned whether it was necessary for patients to dorm together in rooms with up to four people. 
“There’s no real privacy, and obviously if you’re calling people so dangerous, why would you have four people in one room on this unit?” Ramsey said.
Ramsey also said that the removal of curtains from some rooms was degrading for patients. “That’s such an easy fix, and that’s why my perspective, as far as spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a new building is not the best idea if you’re not going to fix all the other stuff that’s wrong with this place, which there is a lot,” he said. 
“It looks like something new and shiny, but it fixes none of the problems,” Ramsey said.
In response to patient concerns, McClure said in an email that the facility does offer a private phone for legal calls, there’s a unit cell phone for patients to call family, and Whiting is working to get tablets as well.
McClure said that staff “routinely monitor and maintain the cleanliness” of the day room. He noted that while the leather and woodworking shops were closed because of safety concerns, the hospital is developing new “therapeutic spaces” that will include a sensory treatment area, a live kitchen, space for group therapy and a screen for games and entertainment. 
While there’s no longer a large vegetable garden, each unit has a planter box. Room size meets or exceeds minimum requirements, he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201012_WhitingForensic_Middletown_KIM_06.jpg,,,2025-11-06 16:02:38.106389

Reagan National and Dulles International, both in Northern VirginiaBusy Nashville, Raleigh-Durham not on listWhile there is significant overlap of the list with the nation’s busiest airports, there are some exceptions. The busiest passenger airport not included was in Nashville, Tennessee, the 28th-busiest airport in the country in 2024, according to Airports Council International-North America.Austin, Texas; St. Louis; Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina; Sacramento, California; New Orleans; Kansas City; and San Jose, California, were also among the 40 busiest airports that will not see reductions Friday.Memphis, Anchorage and Louisville rank outside the top 40 for passenger traffic, but are the top three for cargo movement.Oakland and Indianapolis ranked just outside the top 40 for passenger travel. Teterboro’s airport did not rank in the group’s top 50 busiest.$327 million in daily lost revenue A 10% reduction at the listed airports would decrease revenue at airports by about $327 million daily, according to the council.Because the reductions are to the nation’s busiest airports that serve as hubs for the major airlines, they will also affect airports that aren’t on the list but depend on flights to and from those hubs.The group’s president and CEO, Kevin M. Burke, said in a statement that the group and its members had adapted to quickly changing conditions during the shutdown, but that they were “reaching a breaking point.”“The current trajectory is unsustainable,” Burke said. “With the busy holiday season on the horizon, Congress and the administration must come together now to reopen the federal government with a clean, bipartisan continuing resolution, pay federal employees, and restore operational certainty for the millions of air travelers who take to the skies every day.”Prioritizing safetyAt a press conference Wednesday, Duffy said the decision was made to keep flying safe. He urged overworked air traffic controllers not to work second jobs, but was “not naive” that many would have to in order to pay their bills.He said the agency’s decision was made to prevent any accidents that could result from overworked controllers, while assuring the flying public that commercial air travel remained extremely safe.President Donald Trump was less explicit during an Oval Office appearance Thursday. “Fair question,” he said when asked by a reporter if flying remained safe. “Sean Duffy announced they're cutting in certain areas 10%, and they want to make sure it's 100% safe. That's why they're doing it.”Dems call for shutdown endSome Democratic lawmakers, who have blocked a bill to temporarily reopen the government at fiscal 2025 levels in an effort to force Republicans to negotiate an extension to tax credits for insurance purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplace, renewed those calls in light of the FAA’s decision.Sen. Tina Smith, a Minnesota Democrat, said in a statement the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport sees a daily average of 60,000 passengers on 750 flights.She called on Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to negotiate with her party on the expiring health insurance tax credits to reopen the government “so we don’t see the impacts like the ones at MSP.”“The only path forward is through negotiating, so air traffic in the skies above Minnesota and the country can keep operating safely and at full capacity and our government can finally open up again,” she said.House Transportation and Infrastructure ranking Democrat Rick Larsen of Washington state called the Duffy move “drastic and unprecedented” and requested the FAA share data that went into the decision. He also called for an end to the shutdown to allow air traffic controllers to be paid.“Shutting down parts of our National Airspace System is a dramatic and unprecedented step that demands more transparency,” he said. “The FAA must immediately share any safety risk assessment and related data that this decision is predicated on with Congress. If we want to resolve issues in the NAS, let us fix health care, open government and pay transportation and aviation safety workers.""",,,,2025-11-06 15:17:30.688497

(Photos courtesy of Library of Congress)Two military veterans in the Legislature introduced bills Thursday that would require elementary students in Florida to take their classes with former presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.
The bills, HB 371 and SB 420 would require portraits of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln to be hung in a “conspicuous place” in all K-5 classrooms and in social studies classrooms for grades 6-12. 
The portraits to be used would be determined by the state Department of Education, which would also “make them available to each school district,” per the bill text. The measure would go into effect July 1, 2026, if passed. 
The initiative was introduced by Sen. Danny Burgess, a veteran of the U.S. Army Reserve and Republican from Zephyrhills, and Rep. John Snyder, a Marine Corps veteran and Republican from Stuart.
“For years, Florida’s classrooms proudly displayed portraits of George Washington, our first president, and Abraham Lincoln, our 16th president,” Burgess, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Pre-K-12 Education, said in a news release. “These portraits weren’t just on display to echo lessons to our students; they served as a symbol of the foundation of America and our democracy.”

The lawmakers cite the nation’s 250th birthday on July 4, 2026, “to restore a proud tradition that reminds students of the nation’s history, the principles it stands for, and the vision the founders set in motion.”
Burgess in particular cited a trip he took during the summer to “a historic classroom where portraits of Presidents Washington and Lincoln still hung on the wall.” 
The portraits would be meant to keep the presidents and their accomplishments in the forefront of student development.
If Washington could fight for independence and Lincoln could unite a post-Civil War nation, “then our students can overcome the trials and setbacks they face as they grow into their full potential,” Snyder said in a prepared statement.
“As much as we hope to build a bright future for Florida students, that’s only possible if our students have the foundation of lessons learned from generations past,” Snyder continued. “Presidents Washington and Lincoln are shining examples of servant-leadership, grit, determination, and resolve in the face [of] adversity.”
Last month, Rep. Tom Fabricio introduced a bill that would require teachers to take an oath to the Constitution and swear to be nonpartisan. That bill, HB 147, was referred to two House committees.
Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration is in the process of installing statues of founding fathers in Florida counties named after the historical figures in advance of the 250th anniversary. He kicked off the initiative with a statue of Washington in the Capitol and has placed statues of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin in the counties named in their honor.
Washington, Hamilton, Madison, and Monroe counties await statues.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)North Carolina Democrats’ hopes for 2026 — to flip a U.S. Senate seat, end the Republican party’s supermajority in the state House and strike back against a new congressional map that heavily favors the GOP — got a boost Tuesday after the Democratic party swept statewide races in Virginia, New Jersey and Georgia. But what do those wins really mean for the state’s midterm elections in 2026?
In interviews with NC Newsline, political scientists around the state said the major wins by Democrats could pave the way for U.S. Senate and other statewide wins in North Carolina next year, though much can still change, and congressional and General Assembly districts favoring Republicans will be challenging to surmount even if Democrats win a large share of the vote overall.
They attributed the big night to dissatisfaction with President Donald Trump, particularly over the ongoing government shutdown, which more voters blame on Republicans than Democrats. But they also stressed that the issues on voters’ minds could change drastically by the time of next year’s elections.
“A year out is a very long time in politics, but generally, things tend to solidify in an election year by late summer, early fall,” said Michael Bitzer, professor of politics and history at Catawba College. “Democrats had a very good evening, and that lays a foundation for building a really good evening a year from now in ’26.”
Democratic victories in statewide races
In Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger won the governor’s race by a margin of 55% to her opponent’s 45%. In New Jersey, Democratic nominee for governor Mikie Sherill won 56% to 43%. Both candidates significantly outperformed Vice President Kamala Harris’s margin of victory, which was about 6% in both states.

“Democratic enthusiasm is high,” said David McLennan, a political science professor at Meredith College. “What I saw in terms of the results was not just the fact that Democrats won, but that they won by double-digit numbers in Virginia and New Jersey.”
Chris Cooper, a political scientist at Western Carolina University, said he saw even stronger signs for Democrats’ chances in the midterms in lesser-known races in Georgia and Mississippi.
Georgia saw Democrats win two seats on the state’s Public Service Commission, the first state-level offices the party has won in that state in 20 years. The margins were greater than those in Virginia and New Jersey as well, with both Democratic candidates winning 60% of the vote. And in Mississippi, Democrats broke a two-thirds Republican supermajority in the state Senate for the first time in more than a decade.
“I think the Democratic gains were real, and they were even more important when you dig under the surface,” Cooper said.

A major factor contributing to Democrats’ success on Tuesday was that Republicans bearing more of  the blame for the ongoing government shutdown, according to Catawba College professor of politics and history Michael Bitzer. A Catawba College-YouGov poll conducted in October — written and commissioned by Bitzer’s Center for North Carolina Politics and Public Service — showed about 41% of North Carolinians blame either Republicans or Trump personally for the shutdown.
“The popular perception is that Republicans control the federal government — why can’t they get a budget passed?” Bitzer said, though he noted that Republicans do not control enough Senate seats to pass a budget alone.
He added that this may encourage Democrats to stand firm in their budget demands even as more government services lose funding. “It may be the pressure on Republicans to say, we’re the ones who are going to suffer, President Trump’s no longer on the ballot, but we’re the ones that have to bear the brunt of this.”
What the results mean for Roy Cooper’s campaign
Chris Cooper said while much can still change going into the 2026 midterms, the results are good news for former Gov. Roy Cooper as he competes against Republican Michael Whatley for the U.S. Senate being vacated by Republican Sen. Thom Tillis.

“It does show that Democrats know how to mobilize voters, and that the Democrats are, whether it’s angry or excited or excitement caused by anger, they are willing to get off the couch and go vote,” Cooper, the political scientist, said. “It does not mean that this election is over, however. We need to remember that this is a very different kind of electorate than you’re going to see in a midterm.”
The party that doesn’t control the White House historically tends to do better in the midterm elections. Cooper said that’s compounded in this case because throughout the Trump era, Democrats have performed especially well in off-year and midterm elections, in part because of highly engaged, reliable core voters who can carry lower-turnout races.


McLennan said another positive sign for North Carolina Democrats ahead of next year’s Senate race were big swings among young, Black and Latino voters away from the Republican party after a notable shift toward it in 2024.
“Assuming that Cooper needs a very strong turnout among traditional Democratic constituents and voters, you know, young voters will help Cooper, Hispanic and Black voters will help Cooper,” he said. “The fact that they turned out reasonably well and supported Democrats yesterday was a good sign for him.”

After Tuesday’s losses, Republicans have sought to capitalize on the victory of Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayor’s race to paint all Democrats as radical socialists, including in North Carolina.
On Election Day, for example, the subject line of a press release from the National Republican Senatorial Committee warned of next year’s election: “Roy Cooper Would Bring Mamdani Radicalism to the U.S. Senate.”
Bitzer doesn’t think that’s likely to work well in North Carolina.
“I think if any North Carolina voter looks at that and says, you know, ‘Well, I just can’t vote for Roy Cooper because he’s like the New York mayor,’ they weren’t going to vote for Roy Cooper to begin with,” he said, laughing. “Roy Cooper has a very long history in this state. He has proven time and time again that he’s able to win in North Carolina.”
Democrats gain in NC towns and cities
While North Carolina had no statewide elections in 2025, Democrats performed better than expected in municipal elections in the state. Bitzer, Cooper and McLennan all highlighted Democratic strength in races in cities, suburbs and small towns.

In Cary, for example, longtime Republican council member Jennifer Robinson was unseated by challenger Brittany Richards. Democrats won mayoral races in typically Republican areas like Burlington and Warsaw, and defeated multiple-term Republican incumbent mayors in Wake Forest, Graham, and Fuquay-Varina.
“What a lot of people took as a surprise is a larger trend of people who live in municipalities leaning increasingly left,” Cooper said. “We’ve known that’s true for a long time for Charlotte, for Raleigh, for Asheville, for Wilmington, but I think what we saw is the same thing is also true in some small towns, right? That just the act of being in a municipality means you’re selecting more left-leaning voters.”

That trend has played in reverse in the state’s rural areas in recent years, McLennan said, with voters outside of towns and cities increasingly moving toward Republicans, as has been the case throughout the country. Because most of them did not have the opportunity to participate in an election this year in North Carolina, how they may vote in the midterms remains unknown.
McLennan said Democrats did especially well running on an economic message in this year’s races. “They won on talking about prices, jobs, that sort of thing,” he said. “I think it has to give Democrats confidence going into 2026.”
Whether those apparent strengths are enough to help Democrats win unexpected House victories in North Carolina, however, remains an open question. Under the state’s new congressional map, there are no traditional swing districts in the state — the closest two seats, the 1st Congressional District and the 11th Congressional District, were won by Trump by about 12 and 10 points in 2024, respectively.



Cooper said “it’s going to be tough” for Democrats to win in these districts, adding that the party’s increased margins in Virginia and New Jersey this year still wouldn’t be enough to flip them on their own.
“What the Democrats are going to have to do is to improve upon how much Spanberger improved upon Harris to be able to flip these districts,” he said. “And so they’re just these districts that are resistant to almost any electoral shock.”
Whether the coming year will help or hurt Democrats as they seek to build on those results remains “the great unknown,” Bitzer said, but so far, conditions have proven favorable. “If you want to be in one of two camps when it comes to next year’s midterms, I think Tuesday shows you want to be on the Democratic side.”
“If we see this kind of level of energy and enthusiasm and interest on the Democratic side and it’s not there on the Republican side, I think the size of a Democratic wave could be one that could overcome some of these hurdles that the district lines have created,” he said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7262871-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-06 15:17:30.688497

Central Vermont residents voted overwhelmingly against a $149 million measure to build a new technical education center on Tuesday. 
Across the 18 towns in Washington County that form the Central Vermont Career Center District, about 60% voted against the ballot item, while 40% voted in favor of it, according to results collected by the Barre Town Clerk’s office. 
The district proposed the bond as a response to the lack of space and inadequate facilities at the career center’s current home at Spaulding High School in Barre. For the current school year, the district received 414 applications for 228 spots, according to district data. 
District Superintendent Jody Emerson said last month that the career center also hoped a standalone building would allow it to offer additional programs and expand opportunities to younger grades. Two consulting firms drew up plans for a 167,000-square-foot facility at a currently vacant lot in Graniteville. 
But central Vermont residents raised concerns about the cost of the bond at an informational meeting in October. According to district projections, the bond was expected to raise property taxes between $99 and $420 per year on a $300,000 home. 
The district had set a target date of September 2029 to open the facility if the bond was approved, according to its website. Emerson has said if the bond failed, the district may be able to come back to voters at a later date with a different plan. But what that plan looks like depends on the future of the education redistricting proposals and school construction aid proposals being discussed in the Legislature this year. 
After the results were announced, Emerson said she was grateful for the high turnout because it provided information for the district to determine what its next steps should be. 
She blamed the failure of the vote on the state’s cost-of-living issues and the uncertainty around the future of redistricting, rather than opposition to technical education. “I know the voters support our kids,” she said.

The fund is intended to offset the budget impacts on rural areas due to sweeping Medicaid cuts. However, the temporary fund could only offset a little more than one-third of the package’s estimated $137 billion cut to federal Medicaid spending in rural areas over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan health research organization KFF.Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Dr. Mehmet Oz said the program “moves us from a system that has too often failed rural America to one built on dignity, prevention, and sustainability” in a Thursday statement alongside the announcement. Oz said “every state with an approved application will receive funding so it can design what works best for its communities — and CMS will be there providing support every step of the way.”Each state was asked to “design a plan for transforming its rural health care system” and outline in proposals how they “intend to expand access, enhance quality, and improve outcomes for patients through sustainable, state-driven innovation.” The program allocates $25 billion equally to approved states between fiscal years 2026 and 2030. CMS said states meeting the baseline criteria will then “undergo a rigorous, data-driven merit review” for the remaining half of the funds. In September, when announcing the application opening, CMS said the remaining half of funds would be administered to approved states based on “individual state metrics and applications that reflect the greatest potential for and scale of impact on the health of rural communities.” CMS said approved awardees will be notified by Dec. 31.",,,,2025-11-06 14:56:28.809904

On Thursday, the FAA ordered airlines to cut 10% of their flights at 40 of the country’s busiest airports, including the Philadelphia International Airport, the Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport and the Washington Dulles International Airport. 
Neither Pittsburgh International Airport, Harrisburg International Airport, nor Lehigh Valley International Airport are affected. Major airports in both New York and New Jersey are also included. 
“We expect the vast majority of our customers’ travel will be unaffected, and long-haul international travel will remain as scheduled,” American Airlines said in a Thursday release. “… Disrupting customers’ plans is the last thing we want to do. To provide additional flexibility during the impacted travel period, customers whose flights are cancelled for any reason or who choose not to travel will be able to change their flight or request a refund without any penalty.”

The order came on the 37th day of the federal shutdown, which began Oct. 1 and is the longest in the country’s history. During much of that time, air traffic controllers, customs officers and Transportation Security Administration agents have worked without pay. Last weekend was the worst weekend for traffic controller staffing since the shutdown started, according to CNN. 
The FAA oversees more than 44,000 flights daily, a number that includes passenger, cargo and private aircraft. 
Nearly 31 million people flew through Philadelphia in 2024, according to the airport, across more than 17 million flights. That number doesn’t include cargo planes delivering mail or freight. BWI saw more than 26 million passengers in 2023, while Dulles reported nearly 54 million passengers last year.

“Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) remains open and operating. We encourage all travelers to check flight status directly with their airline and sign up for text or email alerts for the latest flight updates,” the airport tweeted Thursday.
Dulles released a lengthier statement, affirming that non-government services like parking, concessions, customer service and public safety continue to operate as normal.

(File photo by Dan Reynolds Photography/Getty Images)Five homebuilders will construct 130 new homes in South Carolina and sell them for far less than the state’s median price.
The state Housing Finance and Development Authority began the effort, called the Made It Home! program, in August to expand the inventory of affordable homes in the state.
While the builders are still finalizing locations, the $175,000 to $200,000 homes are largely expected to be spread across Richland, Orangeburg, Dorchester, Florence, Darlington, Spartanburg, and Sumter counties.
The companies include:

McGuinn Homes, building 45 homes
D.R. Horton’s Myrtle Beach office, building 40 homes
Gainey Construction of Sumter, building 15 homes
Oak and Ave Property Group, a real estate company that has pushed to increase affordable housing in Spartanburg, will provide 15 homes
Housing Development Corporation of Rock Hill, a low-to-moderate income focused nonprofit, will provide 15 homes

National housing expert: US must build its way out of housing crisis

How it works
The participating firms will build either 1,000-square-foot homes with two bedrooms or 1,200-square-foot homes with three bedrooms. Both sizes must have two bathrooms.
The builders must price the homes at or below $175,000 for a two-bedroom and no more than $200,000 for a three-bedroom.
By comparison, the median listing price of a home in South Carolina is $350,000, according to data from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank.
In exchange for the reduced price, SC Housing will subsidize the construction with a $12,500 payment to the homebuilder for each home constructed.
The state housing agency also will help families buy them.
SC Housing, working with its lending partners, will provide the eligible homebuyers with $25,000 in forgivable down payment and closing cost assistance. The agency also will require buyers to take out a 30-year mortgage through one of its partner lenders. To qualify, the buyers must have household incomes of $135,000 or less, depending on the county.
The buyers must then live in the home and not rent it out or use it as a second home.
The Legislature put $5 million toward the program in this year’s state budget, allowing SC House to more than quadruple its original plans for a 30-house pilot program.
Making it happen
The state’s Home Builders Association expressed concerns early on about whether builders would be able to make the deal pencil out as building costs, land prices and local taxes and fees have soared.
But Howie Mason, the regional construction manager for McGuinn who is leading the project for the firm, said the agency took builders’ feedback on the program into account, which has helped.
For example, Mason said the agency relaxed some of its requirements on the types of materials builders can use. Those rules were largely outdated, he said, and companies now have access to items that are both better quality and more affordable.
Those adjustments coupled with developers willing to give McGuinn a small discount on some of its lots has made participation possible.
“Plus, we want building community to be not just something we advertise but something we do,” Mason said or McGuinn’s decision to get involved.
The company has watched as its primary customer base has shifted over the past couple years. McGuinn had once appealed to first-time homebuyers, but now many of those buyers have been priced out due to higher costs and interest rates.
SC bill would wipe eviction records clean. Advocates say it could help people find housing.

The first homes
Mason said McGuinn plans to start building its first 10 to 15 homes in the Lower Richland area, south of Columbia in a neighborhood called the Reserves at Mill Creek. Construction begins in January, and the homes will hit the market in the spring.
In addition to meeting the bedroom and bathroom requirements under the program, Mason said the homes will have a one-car garage. And while they might not come with certain extras, such as a fenced yard or blinds in the windows, the homes will largely look the same as every other house in the neighborhood.
Next, SC Housing has asked McGuinn to look for lots in Orangeburg County, where the existing housing stock tends to be older and built on larger lots. Because there are fewer homes available and more land under the ones that do exist, Mason said it can be nearly as hard to find a place to live in these more rural counties as it is in the state’s larger metro areas.
With offices in Greenville and Hilton Head, as well as Columbia, Mason said McGuinn might also build some of its allotted homes near Spartanburg or Beaufort as the program continues.
Mason also said this is not McGuinn’s first foray into affordable housing. The builder has worked with the Greenville County Redevelopment Authority and the Columbia Housing Authority in the past.
As for the Made It Home Program, Mason said McGuinn’s executives and investors like the way it was designed, and he thinks it’s something the state should be able to repeat for years to come.
“It puts more power and ability into the hands of the builders,” he said. “And if you let us help, we will.”

In a three-page letter posted to social media, Uthmeier demanded the American Bar Association not “horsewhip” St. Thomas University, a Catholic law school in Miami that the ABA in August declared to be out-of-compliance with the association’s anti-discrimination and equal opportunity standards.

“Admittedly, you currently have considerable power. But reform is in the air,” Uthmeier wrote, addressing St. Thomas University. “Your treatment of STU Law looks like religious discrimination under Florida civil rights law. Leave STU Law alone.”
He accused the ABA of engaging in “woke,” left-wing political activism, claiming the body “hates” religious values.
“It cannot use its accreditation monopoly to put law schools to the tortuous choice of accepting the ABA’s discriminatory, repugnant standards or suffering the fallout of withheld accreditation,” he continued.

The ABA is a national agency that serves as the primary accreditor for multiple states. In Florida, it’s been the sole accrediting body for law schools recognized in the state Supreme Court since 1992, according to the Florida Bar. Losing ABA accreditation would affect STU’s access to state bar exams and could impact the school’s legitimacy.
But the Florida Supreme Court in March created a workgroup to propose alternatives to the ABA in the Bar admissions process, partially because “reasonable questions” have arisen about the ABA’s accreditation standards on “racial and ethnic diversity in law schools and about the ABA’s active political engagement.”
This comes as the Texas Supreme Court announced its plan to end reliance on the ABA for law school oversight, and as Gov. Ron DeSantis moves to create a new accreditation system for state universities.
In August, the ABA found that St. Thomas fell out of compliance with an accreditation standard requiring law schools to not discriminate, to treat people equally and to be fair in hiring, admissions and retention, the ABA reported. That standard requires law schools to “provide the reasons—such as state or federal laws, other authorities, or university policy—which limit the inclusion of any specific group” during their accreditation review.
This follows notice the ABA’s notice in June alleging that St. Thomas Law fell out of compliance with another standard, which requires ABA-accredited law schools to “maintain a budget reflecting anticipated financial resources and expenses for the current and subsequent three fiscal years.”
The ABA also asked the law school to submit a report by Oct. 20 and appear before the ABA council at its February 2026 meeting. St. Thomas Law did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
87.3% of St. Thomas’ students taking the Bar for the first time passed the test in July 2025. This was above the state average of 82.8%.

The state stands to receive up to $800 million through the new Rural Health Transformation Program. Its application narrowed in on stabilizing hospitals, preventative health and technological tools. 
The post Wyoming hopes to bolster health care workforce, services, access with federal health funds appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s application for up to $800 million in federal money earmarked for rural health care focuses on stabilizing hospitals, bolstering preventative health, growing the workforce and using technology to improve access. 
The state submitted its application Wednesday for money from the Rural Health Transformation Program, a new federal initiative created by President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Wyoming will learn its fate at the end of the year with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services expected to announce winners Dec. 31. 
“Wyoming is taking full advantage of the Rural Health Transformation Program championed under President Trump,” Gov. Mark Gordon said in a statement Wednesday. “These funds will help us transform care for Wyoming families and keep critical services local, where they belong.”
The availability of federal funds comes at a time when Wyoming’s gaps in health care access have grown more conspicuous. From the long distances patients travel for care to nursing shortages to affordability concerns in hospitals, Wyoming has a laundry list of needs and challenges related to its health care network. 
New health policies, such as the expiration of Affordable Care Act tax subsidies at the end of this year, are expected to exacerbate barriers to health care for many residents by hiking costs. 
The opportunity 
The Rural Health Transformation Program is designed to funnel $50 billion to states to stabilize and strengthen rural hospitals and providers. Program funding is intended to support priorities like chronic disease prevention, sustaining health care access, workforce development and technical assistance. Funding will be dispersed over five years.
The application was released in September, which created a short timeline for health officials to collect public feedback and determine the state’s priorities.

Starting in September, Wyoming Department of Health staff hosted eight in-person and three virtual meetings on the topic. Meetings took place from Newcastle to Lander, Buffalo to Saratoga. The state also received 1,300 responses to an online survey it circulated. 
Five priorities emerged from the public meetings: 

Improve the financial viability of small rural hospitals to provide basic services. 
Expand affordable health insurance options. 
Recruit and retain primary care physicians.
Train and recruit more nurses and direct care workforce. 
Strengthen OB-GYN services, labor and delivery and related care so women can safely deliver babies. 

Health department staff condensed the priorities into four initiatives in the application. 
The first is “improving access to basic medical care.” That entails consolidating and right-sizing Wyoming’s rural hospitals and EMS systems around sustainable payer sources with a focus on basic services, including maternity care. 
The second is building up the state’s health care workforce. This initiative would expand educational opportunities for nurses, paramedics and other health professionals to smooth career pathways. 
Third is improving residents’ health by promoting healthy diets, exercise and lifestyles. This would help Wyoming fight back against high diabetes and cardiovascular disease rates and alleviate pressure on the health care system.  
The fourth initiative involves using technology to improve health care access and management of chronic disease. 
“Our application reflects a clear vision for Wyoming’s healthcare future,” Gordon said in his statement. “Just as we have done with other transitory federal programs, we recognize this money is not forever and it is taxpayer money. So the investments we make must stand the test of time and not further burden our grandchildren.”
The holes  
At the same time that the Big Beautiful Bill created the rural health fund, it also made changes that many say will make health care less accessible and less affordable, weakening the system and harming communities. 
The act is projected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years, resulting in an estimated 10.3 million fewer people enrolled nationally. The cuts in the federal bill could cost Wyoming nearly 200 jobs per year and shrink the state’s economy by $140 million over five years, an economic analysis finds. 
Enhanced premium tax credits on the Affordable Care marketplace are set to expire at the end of 2025 — and the act did not renew them. That will result in significant premium spikes for some patients, who are just seeing this week what their new plan costs will be. According to Healthy Wyoming, a 60-year-old couple with an annual income of $82,000 will face an increase of $37,422 in annual health care costs due to the tax credit loss. The premium increase for a 45-year-old who earns $62,000 annually could be upwards of $6,000.
Between 11,000-20,000 state residents are at risk of losing their coverage due to the anticipated marketplace cost increases, according to Healthy Wyoming.

In the maternity care landscape, Banner Health announced in September that it would pause labor and delivery services at Platte County Hospital in Wheatland. It marked the fifth Wyoming hospital in recent history to shutter a birth facility.
A legislative committee will bring two bills in the 2026 session aimed at fortifying maternity care. 
One would authorize freestanding birth centers to be covered by Medicaid for births handled by midwives. 
The second bill, a divisive measure that ignited lengthy debate, would set rules and regulations aimed at protecting pregnancy centers, which are typically intended to discourage women from seeking abortions.

The updated website and A-F rankings are aimed at making it easier for families to better understand how their districts and schools are performing, according to an ADE press release.
“They also allow school leaders, district administrators, researchers, and policymakers to dig deeper into the data and identify where improvement is needed so we can direct resources and support to the students that need it most,” Hope Worsham, ADE’s assistant commissioner for Public School Accountability, said in the release. 
Education officials developed district rankings as a result of the Arkansas ACCESS Act, a wide-ranging 2025 education law that, among other things, directed the education department to develop a new formula for determining a letter grade ranking for public school districts and education service cooperatives. 
Under the new formula, each district receives an overall score out of 900 based on achievement, growth and readiness, which is then converted to a letter grade, according to ADE. A district’s letter grade cannot be higher than the highest-performing school or lower than the lowest-performing school in that district. 
The education department released ratings for individual schools under a revised formula in September. On Thursday, ADE announced it was awarding $7 million to 151 schools that “displayed exceptional performance in student achievement and growth” through the Arkansas School Recognition Program.
The formula used to calculate rankings for individual high schools was applied to school districts. Using that formula, education officials reported that 23 districts received an “A,” 98 received a “B,” 98 received a “C,” 24 received a “D” and 11 received an “F.” 
Education Secretary Jacob Olivia told reporters on a virtual call Thursday morning that having both district- and school-level rankings is useful because, while a district might be performing well overall, there may be one school within that district that’s struggling and needs more help.
Oliva mentioned a North Little Rock school that’s had an “F”-ranking for a dozen years as an example of a school where change is needed.
“It’s time for us to start having conversations about how we’re going to close that school and make sure those kids are afforded the high-quality teachers and a high-quality learning environment,” he said. “We have failed a generation of kids by letting districts hide behind individual school grades, so that’s no longer acceptable.”
Arkansas education board approves performance levels for new student assessment

Debates over school accountability have extended to private schools and home schools in recent years with the creation of the Educational Freedom Account program, a school voucher program that allows state funds to be used for allowable education expenses, such as private school tuition. 
Students in the EFA program are required to take an annual assessment, but it doesn’t have to be the same statewide test administered to public school students, the ATLAS exam. The Arkansas Teaching, Learning & Assessment System (ATLAS), which was developed by state education officials, replaced the discontinued ACT Aspire and was first administered to students in spring 2024. 
Because private and homeschool students receiving EFA funds may not take the ATLAS exam, it’s difficult to make an even comparison between students. However, ADE officials said Thursday they’re working on that. 
About 2,000 homeschool students are expected to take the ATLAS exam in the spring, Worsham said. Additionally, ADE is working with the University of Arkansas’ Office for Education Policy to conduct a study that would convert scores from a handful of the more popular assessments to what those scores would be on the ATLAS exam. Worsham said they expect to work on that process during the summer.

(Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey has sent another $2.5 million to state food banks, which are seeing increased need as the federal government shutdown continues to delay SNAP benefits.
The state of West Virginia has now directed a total of $11.1 million to the Mountaineer Food Bank in Gassaway and Facing Hunger Foodbank  in Huntington to distribute to pantries and feeding programs across the state. 
“Every day we’re looking at the situation closely,” Morrisey said in a news release Thursday. “At this time, it was prudent to send another infusion to the food banks so that they stay ahead of the demand. As the Schumer Shutdown continues, we’re going to keep working to ensure that no one goes hungry.” 
The federal government has been shut down for 37 days, causing SNAP benefits to be delayed and leaving federal employees without pay.
Democrats in Congress have repeatedly voted against stopgap funding bills to reopen the government because they want a guarantee that certain health care subsidies will be extended and funded. Republicans don’t want those subsidies included, which are set to expire at the end of the year.
If they do expire, West Virginians will be particularly hurt, with thousands potentially losing their health insurance. Others could see premiums increase by an average of 133%.
Morrisey has said the state would direct $14.1 million to the food banks, and then call in the Legislature for a special session to appropriate more funds if the need exceeds that amount. He’s also asked West Virginia residents and businesses to match the money the state has contributed by donating to Facing Hunger and Mountaineer Food Bank.
The governor has directed the West Virginia National Guard to continue to support food banks, pantries and other programs with logistics and distribution efforts.
“We stand ready to support our state partner agencies, local food banks and nonprofit organizations with critical logistical support to assist West Virginia families and individuals who face food insecurity,” Major General Jim Seward, adjutant general of the West Virginia National Guard, said in the news release.
About 275,000 — nearly one in six — West Virginia residents rely on SNAP. 
The Trump administration initially refused to use contingency funds to pay the benefits during the shut down. The benefits would have been issued Nov. 1. After two courts ordered the administration to do so, the White House announced that it would partially fund the benefits during the month of November.
In court filings on Thursday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, said benefits would be reduced by about 35%, a smaller reduction than it initially estimated, according to reporting by States Newsroom. 
State officials have not given a timeline for when West Virginians might have their benefits.

(Courtesy of the Indiana Department of Health)Nearly 50 Indiana Department of Health staffers face being furloughed starting next week because of the ongoing federal government shutdown.
State health officials confirmed Thursday it had notified 48 employees that they could temporarily lose their jobs effective Nov. 9 if the federal shutdown that began Oct. 1 isn’t resolved.
Those employees work for the department’s Consumer Services and Health Care Regulation Commission, which has functions funded by both state and federal sources, agency spokeswoman Lisa Welch told the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
“Since the shutdown, these employees have focused primarily on state-funded responsibilities, which has reached its limit,” Welch said in an email response.
The Consumer Services and Healthcare Regulation Commission’s work includes health care facility licensing and certification, health care quality and ensuring radiation safety and protection among health care providers, according to the Health Department’s website.
The Health Department has nearly 900 total employees, according to the Indiana Transparency Portal.
The state will cover the employer portion of insurance premiums for the furloughed workers and they will be eligible for unemployment benefits, Welch said. Those workers, however, will not be eligible for back pay which federal employees have typically received following furloughs during previous government shutdowns.

About 39% supported the prospect, but just 23% ""strongly"" backed it.","Voters mark their ballots during the presidential election on Nov. 5, 2024 in Tryon, North Carolina. (Photo by Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images)Hoosiers who oppose early redistricting are more vehement in their convictions than proponents, a new poll says.
Indiana lawmakers will meet in December to consider redrawing the state’s two blue congressional districts red ahead of the 2026 midterm elections — following a months-long pressure campaign by President Donald Trump and his administration officials for a mid-cycle flip.
In a statewide survey of 800 registered voters, 51% didn’t want redistricting now — with 45% “strongly” opposed. About 39% supported the prospect, but just 23% “strongly” backed it.
Virginia-based Bellwether Research, led by prominent Hoosier pollster Christine Mathews, performed the survey for Indiana Conservation Voters. The group is against redistricting.
“The negative intensity on the opposition is 2-to-1 over the positive intensity,” Matthews said. “So what I’m saying about this is: the folks who are are really against this, are really against this. And the folks that say they support it are mildly supportive of it.”
During a Thursday news conference, she said the sample “is robustly reflective” of Indiana’s GOP voters, noting, “I have seen the other polls on redistricting. I think our survey is probably the most solidly Republican … in terms of sample composition.”
Of the 800 respondents, 49% were Republicans, 35% were Democrats and 16% were independents.
Pollster Christine Matthews presents the results of a survey during a virtual news conference. (Screenshot of virtual meeting)
The poll was conducted Oct. 29-30 and Nov. 1 — after Gov. Mike Braun announced a special session — with an overall margin of error of 3.5%.
Bellwether Research also targeted more than 600 voters living in the state’s 40 Republican-held Senate districts. Of those, 48% opposed redistricting — with 43% “strongly” against it. About 42% professed support for redistricting, with 26% feeling “strongly” in favor.
Indiana’s Senate has become a potential stumbling block for early redistricting proponents. While the House’s GOP leader has confirmed enough support within his caucus to pass new maps, his counterpart in the Senate has repeatedly said the votes “aren’t there.”
Other findings
Voters are generally aware of the redistricting push, per the poll.
Most respondents — 63% — reported following redistricting news “fairly” or “very” closely, with Democrats more likely than Republicans to be keeping up on developments.
Bellwether Research also looked at how voters’ sentiments could translate into action at the ballot box.
Asked how they’d feel if their state legislator voted to redraw the maps, 43% said they would disapprove and be less likely to vote for them. About 6% would disapprove but wouldn’t change their vote.
Meanwhile, 27% said they would approve and be more likely to vote for that legislator. About 12% wouldn’t pay much attention either way.
Some questions were asked only of Republican voters.
New Indiana polls show Hoosiers losing faith in both parties — and their own leaders

Bellwether Research presented them with a pair of options, for example. One proclaimed that GOP lawmakers who oppose redistricting are “standing up for fairness” and “keeping politics out” of the process, and the second asserted those lawmakers are “betraying” Trump and “helping Democrats keep power.”
Republican respondents were fairly split, with 38% choosing the “fairness” perspective, 37% choosing the “betrayal” version and 26% unsure. That’s although 90% of them viewed Trump positively.
The survey also tested various anti-redistricting arguments, ranging from a proposed focus on kitchen-table issues — which voters found most convincing — to accusations of D.C.-led election-rigging.
“If I were state legislator, I would not be worried about where I stood on redistricting in terms of backlash,” Matthews said. “I would be worried about not doing enough for voters in their real lives.”
She described little evidence that Hoosiers are connecting their support for the president to state lawmakers’ actions.
“I know that the folks who want Republican legislators to do this are threatening retribution, but I’m not seeing in the data that individual voters are going to be incredibly responsive to that,” Matthews said. “… They could run candidates against these folks, but I don’t see average, rank-and-file Republicans in Indiana getting super fired up about this.”
Indiana’s elections are largely uncompetitive, so many races are decided at the primary election in May — and primary voters tend to lean further one way or the other on the partisan spectrum.
Still, Matthews said, “I’m not seeing a lot of evidence that even when you shrink this down to a low-turnout, Republican primary election, that this is going to be the kind of issue that is a single-issue determinant.”
The poll also asked voters how they feel about the country and state’s top two political leaders.

Trump: 50% favorable, 45% unfavorable
Vice President JD Vance: 50% favorable, 42% unfavorable
Indiana Gov. Mike Braun: 32% favorable, 50% unfavorable
Indiana Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith: 16% favorable, 32% unfavorable, with many unsure or unaware of him.

The results echo other surveys conducted in October by North Star Opinion Research on behalf of Independent Indiana, and in August by the left-leaning Change Research.
District lines are typically reconfigured every 10 years, after the release of new decennial census data. The Statehouse’s GOP supermajorities constructed the current 7-2 maps in 2021.

She pointed to an increase in scores statewide but acknowledged there is more improvement to be had (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri public schools showed continued improvement in annual performance reports released by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education Thursday, with 56% of districts and charter schools raising their scores.
The state is in its fourth year of the Missouri School Improvement Program 6, which education officials deem “more rigorous” than the previous iteration of the program. In 2022, the system’s pilot year, 112 school districts and charters scored lower than 70% — the score required to be fully accredited by the education department.
Accreditation decisions based on the MSIP6 scores are a year away, but the number of districts at risk for a lower classification has decreased dramatically in four years.
Based on districts’ three-year composite scores, which the department will use to determine accreditation, 29 school districts are in range to be provisionally accredited. None scored below 50%, which would put them at risk for being unaccredited.
Three charter schools scored below 50% and 29 scored below 70%, but these scores will not be part of next year’s classification decisions. Despite MSIP6 being used to score charters, they have separate methods of accreditation.
“I am so proud of our educators and students,” Commissioner of Education Karla Eslinger said in a press conference Thursday afternoon. “You must take some time to celebrate the good, but we also know there is room for improvement.”
The scores include a variety of factors, like standardized test scores, student growth and career readiness. Student performance comprises 70% of the score. The other 30% is based on continuous improvement measures.
Of the 553 districts and charter schools in the state, 152 raised their score by at least 5% this year. Some showed dramatic improvement.
Neosho School District boosted its score from 61.5% in 2024 to 85.5% this year. Superintendent Jim Davis, who took the role in August 2024, told The Independent that the improvement is largely because of a district-wide focus on proficiency and literacy.
“There was a lot of work that was put into it to get us to take that jump,” he said, “but we’re proud of that, and we’re expecting to continue moving up with the systems that we built here.”
Classroom instruction in Neosho is expected to meet grade-level standards, he said, which pushes struggling students to catch up.
“Students expedite their academic growth when they are given grade-level content,” Davis said. “So the more time that we spend in grade-level content, the faster they’re going to move.”
The district is one of 32 districts and charter schools in Missouri’s Comprehensive Literacy State Development program, a grant program which provides literacy resources and professional development among other assets.
The district received top scores for student growth in reading, math and science and received 50% of the points possible for social studies growth among the full student population. It got a quarter of the points possible for social studies growth in student groups deemed “historically underperforming” by the education department, such as low-income students and English-language learners.
“We want to create success,” Davis said. “But also we have got to continue developing our team so that, moving forward, all students can be successful.”
The Southern Boone School District in Ashland also showed dramatic improvement, going from 78.9% in 2024 to 95.9% this year. It is one of 22 school districts with a score of at least 90%.
“You can contribute our growth to continued work with our teams of teachers and administrators on our curriculum development and making sure that we’ve got the right resources for kids and teachers to use, along with making sure that our teachers are well-prepared,” Superintendent Tim Roth told The Independent.
The district has invested in new textbooks and software to bolster curriculum. At the middle school level, the district has instituted an assessment system that gives continuous checks on student achievement. Teachers review the results regularly and brainstorm ways to improve in small-group settings, Roth said.
The district received 100% for student growth on standardized tests across subject areas. It also earned top scores in attendance.
“Something that stands out for us is just the value that our parents and community put on education,” Roth said. “With our students being here on a regular basis, we’re very happy that we have that support and that learning is a priority.”
Eslinger told reporters that attendance and literacy are a focus for the department.
“We are on the right track,” she said. “Our data points are showing improvement, but we still have work to do.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110625_Eslinger1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-11-06 14:01:46.372455

Green International Airport officials are urging travelers to check with their airlines, even as the Warwick airport so far remains unaffected by the Trump administration’s plan to cut flights starting Friday to ease pressure on unpaid air traffic controllers during the federal shutdown.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced Wednesday the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) would restrict air travel in 40 “high-traffic” areas beginning Friday. The Associated Press on Thursday reported a list of affected airports, which includes Boston Logan International Airport and airports in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.
T.F. Green is not on the list, but airport spokesperson Bill Fischer said in a statement that “every airport in the country will likely be impacted by this situation in some manner.”
“We are working with every airline that services PVD to understand local impacts,” Fischer said. “Each airline will have to make independent decisions on how they will operate.”
Airlines that serve the T.F. Green are Allegiant, American Airlines, Breeze Airways, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest, Sun Country, and United.
Breeze Airways spokesperson McKinnley Matson said early indications suggest a minimal impact to the airline’s operations at its growing base of operations at T.F. Green.
“The safety of our Guests remains our top priority and we’re committed to working with those who are impacted to ensure they’re fully supported. We’ll transparently communicate any updates to our Guests as we learn more.
Reached for comment Thursday, the FAA issued an automated response that due to a lapse in funding, the agency is not responding to routine media inquiries — though it did include a statement on air traffic controller staffing.
“As Secretary Duffy has said, there have been increased staffing shortages across the system,” the automated response stated. “When that happens, the FAA slows traffic into some airports to ensure safe operations.”
Air traffic controllers have worked without pay since the shutdown began Oct. 1, many logging six-day weeks with mandatory overtime.
“It’s pretty tragic,” Sal Corio, president of the Rhode Island Pilots Association, said in an interview Thursday. “I can’t imagine having to go home from work each and every single day and not taking in any pay.” 
That’s why the association is in the midst of collecting money to support the 39 Rhode Island air traffic controllers and their families amid the ongoing shutdown. Corio declined to share how much has been collected for gift cards but said the total will be announced at the group’s annual meeting Tuesday, where some controllers will speak about their work.
General aviation pilots don’t often rely on the system of controllers, except when flying through inclement weather. But Corio said without the air traffic controllers, the system falls apart.
“They’re essential workers,” he said.

Jim Pillen, left, shakes hands with Attorney General Mike Hilgers after signing a new executive order shutting off Medicaid dollars for abortion providers in Nebraska. Nov. 6, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen signed an executive order Thursday cutting off state tax dollars from medical service providers in Nebraska that offer abortions.
Local abortion clinics primarily receive state aid through Medicaid funds, which supports various services beyond abortions, including birth control and cancer screenings. This summer, Congress cut off federal funds to Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers and restricted Medicaid funds going to abortion providers through the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”
Under the order, Pillen said any abortion provider terminated from another state’s Medicaid program will have their enrollment terminated in Nebraska.
“We’re not going to let abortion providers skirt accountability while claiming our money,” Pillen said.
Planned Parenthood officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Kenny Zoeller, director of the governor’s Policy Research Office, said Nebraska abortion providers currently receive about $250,000 per year in state tax dollars.
“From my seat, $1 is too much,” Pillen said.
Pillen announced the executive order at a press conference alongside Attorney General Mike Hilgers and Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services CEO Steve Corsi.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Hilgers clarified that state and federal law already prohibit tax dollars from supporting abortion procedures, but the executive order expands that restriction to cut off funding for any services offered by an abortion provider.
Hilgers said state officials have considered taking this action for some time but were waiting on the results of the U.S. Supreme Court case Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic. The high court’s ruling prohibits Medicaid enrollees in any state that excludes Planned Parenthood from using their Medicaid coverage to obtain other services from Planned Parenthood, including contraception..
Hilgers said the ruling gave Nebraska “unassailable ground,” to enforce Pillen’s order.
“It is quite clear that Nebraska can take the action that it is taking today,” Hilgers said.
The executive order is titled, “Protecting the Life, Health, and Welfare of Pregnant Women, and Unborn Human Life.” The order specifically names Planned Parenthood, but Hilgers later clarified that the restriction would also apply to Bellevue’s abortion clinic, CARE Reproductive Health.
Though Planned Parenthood has two clinics in Nebraska — one in Omaha and the other in Lincoln — the Lincoln clinic’s website specifies that it does not offer abortions. Hilgers said the order will only apply to clinics that provide abortions. However, Pillen speculated that any Planned Parenthood clinic has the ability to provide abortions.
Both Hilgers and Pillen noted that Nebraska has a collection of other clinics that offer services to pregnant women but don’t offer abortions. They argued there are plenty of resources for pregnant women to access care in Nebraska. They were likely referencing pregnancy help centers, which have been both praised and criticized for steering people away from abortion clinics and other reproductive care.
The executive order was met with praise from anti-abortion lobbying groups, including Nebraska Family Alliance and the Nebraska Catholic Conference. In an email statement, Nebraska Family Alliance Executive Director Nate Grasz said “Nebraska is rightfully taking action to protect life and uphold our state’s pro-life values.”
“(Planned Parenthood) is not an organization that deserves public money or public patronage,” Marion Miner, assistant director of pro-life and family for the Nebraska Catholic Conference, said in a separate statement.

Delaware Leaders Host “Unified by Service” Fireside Chat Honoring Veterans and Military Families
By Jamie Kleman| Delaware LIVE | November 6, 2025
The Delaware Department of Human Resources, in partnership with the Delaware Department of Veterans Affairs and the Delaware National Guard, hosted a “Fireside Chat” in New Castle this week to honor veterans and military families while highlighting their impact on Delaware’s workforce and communities.
The event, held in recognition of Veterans Day and National Veterans and Military Families Month, gathered state officials, service members, and families for a candid conversation themed “Unified by Service.” The discussion focused on supporting veterans transitioning into civilian careers, the strengths they bring to the workforce, and ways Delaware can continue to empower military families.
Panelists included Brig. Gen. (Ret.) Karen Berry, Secretary of the Delaware Department of Veterans Affairs, and Maj. Gen. James A. Benson, Adjutant General of the Delaware National Guard. The conversation was moderated by Richard M. Potter Jr., Director of the Division of People and Culture within the Department of Human Resources.
Berry, who has long championed Delaware’s veteran community, reminded the audience that the skills veterans develop through service are invaluable to both public and private employers. “Veterans and their families give so much every day,” she said. “Their leadership, discipline, and problem-solving abilities strengthen every organization they join.”
Benson echoed that message, noting that military experience shapes individuals who thrive under pressure and value teamwork. “Our service members carry the values of leadership, teamwork, and resilience into every part of their lives,” he said. “When they return to their communities, those qualities make Delaware stronger.”
Governor Matt Meyer offered his gratitude in a recorded message, emphasizing the importance of recognizing not only veterans but also the families who serve alongside them. “Delaware is stronger because of the commitment and service of our veterans and their families,” Meyer said. “We owe them more than thanks; we owe them opportunities to succeed.”
Potter encouraged attendees to continue building bridges between state agencies and the veteran community, highlighting how Delaware is working to make employment more accessible for service members and their spouses. The Department of Human Resources has introduced programs aimed at improving hiring practices, mentorship, and awareness across state agencies to ensure Delaware remains a leader in veteran-friendly employment.
Audience members, many of whom were veterans working in state departments or family members of active-duty service members, shared personal experiences and discussed ways to strengthen outreach efforts. The conversation concluded with a moment of recognition for Delaware veterans who have transitioned into leadership roles within state government.
Organizers said the “Unified by Service” initiative will continue through additional events and forums that celebrate the contributions of veterans and military families while addressing the challenges they face in the workforce.

A decade ago, a group of engineers and water experts from the Netherlands visited Hampton Roads and helped reshape the region’s approach to rising tides.
The group met with local leaders in a series of summer 2015 workshops known as the Dutch Dialogues, sharing lessons learned from managing water in the low-lying country.
The event helped inform and inspire numerous flood control projects across Hampton Roads, such as stormwater parks and reconstructed wetlands.
“The original Dutch Dialogues challenged us to see water not as an enemy to defeat, but as a neighbor to live with,” Scott Smith, coastal resilience engineer with the city of Hampton, said Wednesday at a conference in downtown Norfolk.
“That shift from resistance to relationship has transformed plans, projects and partnerships across the region. We’ve made real progress.”
This week’s event, Dutch Dialogues: Life at Sea Level, celebrates the 10th anniversary of the landmark event and charts a path forward.
 ‘Living with water’

The Netherlands has been battling water for centuries.
About a third of the country along the North Sea is below sea level, and the rest is not much higher.
Victoria Elema, who works for the country’s Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management and the Netherlands International Water Ambition, said they used to focus on “gray” infrastructure – hardened, manmade structures such as large storm surge barriers.
“Gradually, we also saw that just fighting water wouldn’t be sufficient, so we changed our approach a little bit to also living with water,” she said in an interview at the conference. “Give the river more space, give water more space, show people that it’s nice to have water in your surroundings, and water is not your enemy, things like that.”
The Dutch have become renowned for extensive water management techniques, including a series of dikes and dams, canals, floating houses and windmills that pump water.
“We’re in the process of looking forward to the years to come, because we are facing increasing sea level rise,” Elema said. “So we’re not done yet. Water is part of our DNA in the Netherlands, so we will always work with that and think of new solutions.”
They also want others to learn from their mistakes, she said. That’s how they ended up in Norfolk, which is also deeply tied to and threatened by water. (Even the Hague water body in Norfolk has connections: Two Dutchmen helped develop Ghent in the late 1800s.)
David Waggonner, founder of the New Orleans-based architecture firm Waggonner & Ball, helped develop the Dutch Dialogues program. After the city’s levees failed during Hurricane Katrina, he tagged along with a group looking at flood defenses in the country.
The Dutch Dialogues were first held in New Orleans before coming to Norfolk and later Charleston. Waggonner said the goal was to keep spreading lessons learned.
“You can’t maintain awareness if you’re inside your own bubble,” he said. “You have to look outside.”
The 2015 event focused on boosting Norfolk’s application to the federal government in the National Disaster Resilience Competition.
Working with the nonprofit Wetlands Watch, students from Old Dominion and Hampton universities had been working in the Chesterfield Heights neighborhood to identify potential solutions to chronic flooding.
Their ideas helped inspire Norfolk’s grant application and the Dutch Dialogues helped refine it, leading to the $112 million Ohio Creek Watershed Project completed in 2023.
Smith said the discussions shaped the last 10 years of his career in the resilience field, including the Resilient Hampton initiative. Hampton’s City Council codified the “Living with Water” concept as a strategic priority.
“We realized the threat and now we’re working to see how we can adapt,” Smith said.
For example, Hampton is working on the Big Bethel Blueway, transforming an existing drainage canal into public green space while adding storage capacity.
At this week’s conference, local leaders acknowledged challenges, such as how to effectively and equitably move people out of harm’s way and how to fund investments.
 Moving forward

Much of Virginia’s resilience work has relied on money and leadership from the federal and state governments, said Ben McFarlane, chief resilience officer for the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission.
“That model is no longer going to work anytime soon,” he said. “The impacts that we’re already seeing in terms of flooding on our communities demand that we model new approaches to decision-making, to planning, to designing, to building infrastructure to help our communities deal with these issues.”
Protecting Hampton Roads is not just a local issue, he said. The concentration of military facilities also makes it a matter of national security. Officials have worked regionally on resilience, such as agreeing to regional stormwater design standards that incorporate sea level rise.
But more needs to be done, “piloting new solutions to old problems,” McFarlane said.
Carol Considine, director of applied projects at ODU’s Institute for Coastal Adaptation and Resilience, said the Dutch Dialogues prompted many flooding projects.
To maximize time and money, the region needs to prioritize projects with broader advantages, she said, such as greenery that protects people from extreme heat, buffers pollution and absorbs excess water.
“Hard conversations will hopefully happen here about how we need to be getting multiple benefits out of solutions, and not addressing one piece of climate change, which is flooding,” Considine said.
Smith said he hopes this week’s event will “re-energize” local officials.
“We don’t want to become complacent,” he said. “We want to advance.”

By Staff Writer | Delaware LIVE | November 6, 2025
As winter approaches, the Delaware State Fire Marshal’s Office is urging residents to protect themselves and their families from the silent killer of carbon monoxide during National Carbon Monoxide Awareness Month.
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas produced by fuel-burning devices such as furnaces, generators, fireplaces, grills and vehicles. Because it cannot be detected by human senses, it can pose a hidden threat in homes, garages and other enclosed spaces.
High concentrations of carbon monoxide can be fatal within minutes, while lower, long-term exposure can cause lasting health problems. Symptoms are often mistaken for flu or fatigue and may include headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, shortness of breath, weakness, blurred vision, or sleepiness.
The Delaware State Fire Marshal’s Office emphasized that awareness and prevention are the best protection and shared several safety reminders for households:

Install carbon monoxide alarms in your home, garage or any area with fuel-burning appliances, especially near sleeping areas.
Take a portable carbon monoxide alarm when traveling, as some hotels are not required to have them.
Know the difference between alarms. A carbon monoxide alarm typically beeps four times in a row, while a smoke alarm beeps three times.
Test alarms monthly and replace batteries as recommended by the manufacturer.
Schedule annual inspections of furnaces, fireplaces and chimneys, and keep vents and exhausts clear of snow or debris.
Use generators safely, keeping them at least twenty feet from buildings and never operating them indoors.
Never use a gas stove or oven to heat your home, and do not run a vehicle inside a closed or attached garage.

Officials reminded Delaware residents that carbon monoxide incidents are completely preventable when basic safety measures are followed. The risk rises during colder months as families use heaters, fireplaces and backup power sources more often.
The Fire Marshal’s Office encourages homeowners, renters and travelers to check their alarms this month and review safety steps with all members of the household.

The report, which was prepared following an executive directive from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, draws on data from several state departments, including Agriculture & Rural Development, Transportation, the Housing Development Authority and others.



 Key Highlights

In Michigan’s agriculture sector, the report notes a sharp drop in exports: wheat exports declined 89%, cherries down 62%, apples down 58%, and soybeans down 46%.
Rising consumer food costs: the report estimates a 3.6% increase in food prices this year due to tariffs, with households in the bottom 10-20% income bracket facing as much as a 5% drop in disposable income.
In the housing market, tariff-driven material cost increases are estimated to raise the price of a new home by about $10,900.
Infrastructure and construction projects are also being affected, with state transportation officials projecting that the combined effects of tariffs and inflation could raise costs up to $218 million for road and bridge projects.




“Michigan families and businesses are all facing rising prices and constant uncertainty because of our chaotic national tariff strategy,” Whitmer, a Democrat, said in a press release. “While I cannot change the national tariff rate, I will continue advocating for Michigan every chance I get so we can keep lowering costs for families.”
The report cautions that higher food prices and rising housing costs may squeeze household budgets, particularly for lower-income families. Additionally, delayed or more expensive public projects could slow job creation and economic growth.
The analysis was released the same day that the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on the legality of Republican President Donald Trump imposing sweeping global tariffs under an economic emergency powers statute.

The order followed reports Wednesday evening of an ammonia leak at the facility.
Yazoo County Emergency Manager Jack Willingham said he wasn’t sure what caused an explosion that led to the leak, but said there was no fire from the burst. There were no injuries or deaths from the event, he said, and all roads are back open after diversions last night on U.S. 49.
“My building’s a mile away, and I could feel it shake,” Willingham said. “And when I walked outside you could see the huge plume. But there was no fire I’m aware of.”
The county lifted the evacuation order, he added, around 1 a.m. on Thursday. There were about 15 families who live along Renshaw and Generette Roads who needed to evacuate, Willingham said. The shelter order applied to everyone living north of 15th Street in Yazoo City.
Gov. Tate Reeves posted on social media Thursday around 9 a.m. that the shelter-in-place order was still in effect, but posted shortly after that it had been lifted. 
Air quality levels were safe in the area as of about 6 a.m. Thursday, the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality said. The agency said it will continue to monitor air levels through the day.

The Cedar Rapids private college announced in a news release this week it has become one of more than 100 colleges and universities across the U.S. to partner with the Google initiative, which provides tools like Gemini and NotebookLM to the college at no cost and offers certificates in different areas of study.
According to the release, AI is something faculty at Coe have begun exploring for classroom work as well as research. Two courses, “AI in the Business World” and “K-12 Teacher Training for AI,” will open for students to take in the spring.

“Faculty across all disciplines have begun to factor AI use, as well as its challenges and limitations, into their course design,” said Coe College Provost Angela Ziskowski in the release. “To be able to utilize AI effectively is an emerging skill that will have applications everywhere and we want our students to be prepared.”
Through a “guided learning mode” embedded in Gemini Pro, the release stated the AI tool will operate as “a learning companion,” asking questions of students and providing support to help students find the answer rather than just generating it. According to the release, Google consulted students, instructors and researchers in developing the mode to ensure it helps with critical thinking skills and finding true understanding of a subject.
Coe College President David Hayes said in the release AI is being used “with intentionality” by professionals and students who know how to “responsibly utilize AI” to bring greater efficiency to the workplace will be a step ahead of their competition for jobs.
“Utilizing this technology builds practical skills students will need for high-paying careers today and tomorrow,” Hayes said in the release. “By collaborating with industry leaders like Google, we are ensuring our students have the resources they need to innovate and succeed while fostering a spirit of innovation on campus.”

(Getty Images)Following community input and critique, the New Mexico Public Education Department this week submitted its final draft of the court-ordered remedial plan for a long-running educational equity lawsuit, meeting the final court deadline.
Advocates say they intend to analyze the plan and meet with community members later this month about it, but some already have noted what they described as its shortcomings.
The plan, ordered by First Judicial District Court Judge Matthew Wilson, marks the latest action taken by the state to improve educational opportunities and outcomes for at-risk New Mexico students, including students with disabilities, low-income students, English Language Learners and Native American students. Wilson ordered the state in April to complete a final plan—as part of the ruling in the landmark Yazzie/Martinez lawsuit—outlining specific steps the education department, Legislature and school districts will take to ensure all students receive quality education. 
The department, along with the Los Alamos National Laboratory Foundation and WestEd, collected stakeholder and community input over the summer and submitted an initial draft plan to the court in early October. The New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty and other educational advocates in the state last month criticized the plan for being too “vague” and not including the voices of all entities that provided input. 
According to a Tuesday PED news release, the department updated the plan to include “clearer outcomes and accountability measures based on feedback from students, families, educators, tribal leaders and community members statewide.” The release also stated that the plan now includes “more specific performance targets and expands support” for the at-risk students identified in the initial court finding. “We listened to what communities told us they need, and this plan reflects those priorities,” PED Secretary Mariana Padilla said in a statement. 
The release stated that the state also revised the plan to include expanded training for educators on “cultural and linguistic responsiveness;” stronger collaboration between the PED, school districts, tribal governments, institutions of higher education and other state agencies and community organizations; and an online “accountability and transparency tool” that highlights funding, implementation of programs and student outcomes.
New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty Education Director Melissa Candelaria said during a news conference Wednesday that while she and her colleagues have not yet completed an in-depth analysis of the latest plan, community experts maintain that what matters the most is culturally affirming curriculum; adequate staffing; wraparound services; behavioral health support; “robust” resources for multilingual learners and students with disabilities; and addressing funding inequities.
“Our communities have long shared a vision for a world class education: one that is grounded in the rich cultures, languages, histories and values of New Mexico,” Candeleria said during the news conference. She said the organization, which represents the plaintiffs in the Yazzie/Martinez case, will analyze the newest version of the plan this month and will meet with students, teachers and community experts on Nov. 21 to discuss what it lacks.
Andrew Montoya, director of Community Schools for the National Education Association’s New Mexico chapter, said during the news conference that the PED’s plan does not make adequate changes that will improve student support and outcomes. 
“The Public Education Department’s plan treats equity as an add-on, misses the mark on community collaboration, is constitutionally insufficient and will accelerate the educator exodus already harming our students,” Montoya said. 
He pointed out that his department’s analysis found that the plan added five to 10 more hours of work for teachers without removing current duties; between $400 and $500 million of unfunded obligations; and did not take into account teacher retention and why educators leave their positions. 
“This plan also omits the tribal remedy framework entirely, ignoring requests from New Mexico’s pueblos, nations and tribes for indigenous-led curriculum and training centers,” Montoya said. “We urge the Public Education Department to reject this plan as-written; rebuild it with students, educators and tribal leadership at the table; and fund the support our students and teachers deserve. When we fight for student-led solutions, fair pay, manageable work loads and respect for tribal sovereignty, we’re not protecting the status quo, we’re fighting for educational justice for every child in New Mexico.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/teacher-in-a-classroom-1536x864-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-06 13:02:04.777855

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Candidates for office may not need to close and open a bank account each election cycle, according to two draft opinions from the Oklahoma Ethics Commission.
In both opinions, the Commission recommended that those running for reelection for the same office in a subsequent election cycle not be required to open a new bank account. They would still be required to close and reopen a campaign committee with the commission.
Rep. Judd Strom, R-Copan, requested clarification of the Commission’s existing rule in September. 
Strom wrote that the current rule, as he understands it, requires a candidate or officeholder to close their current bank account, open a new one and transfer carry-over funds each election cycle, even when running for reelection of the same office. 
“I have found the action to be cumbersome, be confusing, and possibly lead to the unintended consequence of observers being misled by the transfer of funds,” he wrote. 
The first opinion also proposes that the campaign committee’s bank account can be opened with a bank without specifying a year on the account’s name. 
The commission is expected to hear written or oral public feedback on the preliminary opinions at its Nov. 13 meeting ahead of any vote to finalize either.

,DC,2025-11-06 17:19:32+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump administration ordered to pay full $9B in November SNAP benefits amid shutdown,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-ordered-pay-full-9b-november-snap-benefits-amid-shutdown,,"This report has been updated.A federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration Thursday to pay roughly $9 billion for a full month of nutrition assistance benefits by the next day.Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr., who was appointed by Democratic former President Barack Obama, said the administration blew its chance to choose to pay only partial benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, when it failed to release funds by a Wednesday deadline.He said a social media post by President Donald Trump showed the president sought to use hunger for political leverage during the government shutdown, which stretched into day 37 on Thursday.Earlier, in a Friday oral order that he expanded in a Saturday written order, McConnell had said the government must either pay full benefits by Monday or partial benefits from a contingency fund by Wednesday. The government did neither, he said Thursday.The administration had argued it was impossible to pay the benefits, which go to 42 million Americans, within a few days, saying that the USDA had never calculated partial benefits and that coordinating new payments for SNAP, a federally funded program administered by the states, was difficult. The administration quickly appealed the ruling to the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.“Today is a major victory for 42 million people in America. The court could not be more clear – the Trump-Vance administration must stop playing politics with people’s lives by delaying SNAP payments they are obligated to issue,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward, co-counsel for the coalition challenging the administration.‘USDA cannot now cry’But McConnell said the department created the problem, in part by failing to prepare for it far earlier. USDA was obligated to spend from a contingency fund to ensure SNAP benefits flowed into November uninterrupted, he said. “USDA did not do so,” he said. “Even when Nov. 1 came, USDA refused to use the congressionally mandated contingency funds. USDA cannot now cry that it cannot get timely payments to beneficiaries for weeks or months because states are not prepared to make partial payments.“USDA arbitrarily and capriciously created this problem by ignoring the congressionally mandated contingency funds and failing to timely notify the states.”McConnell also pointed to Trump’s post on Truth Social on Tuesday that indicated he would not authorize payments consistent with the judge’s order until Democrats agreed to his terms to end the government shutdown.“The day before the compliance was ordered, the president stated his intent to defy the court order when he said, ‘SNAP payments will be given only when the government opens,’” McConnell said Thursday.Child nutrition funding suggestedThe USDA had said it would pay only partial November benefits from a contingency fund holding about $4.5 billion, rather than tap into other money at its disposal, including a $23 billion fund for child nutrition programs.The coalition of cities and nonprofit organizations that sued to force the administration to pay SNAP benefits for November has argued the court should force USDA to pay full benefits for November. In addition to the missed Wednesday deadline, the move violated a fundamental administrative law requiring federal agencies not to make arbitrary and capricious decisions, Kristin Bateman of the Democracy Forward Foundation, which is representing the groups, said Thursday.The child nutrition program would not need its billions of dollars until June, she said, meaning that transferring funds for SNAP would only actually hurt the child nutrition program if the shutdown persists until then.“A decision on such a highly unlikely set of events is not reasoned decision-making,” Bateman said. “It's particularly unreasonable because the defendants have not explained why they would choose to let 42 million Americans, including 16 million children, go hungry now in order to guard against the extreme outside chance that come June, there won't be enough money to fund child nutrition programs.”McConnell agreed that invoking the child nutrition fund was “entirely pretextual,” which was demonstrated in part by Trump’s post and other statements by administration officials.“The defendants’ stated desire to conserve funding for the child nutrition programs is entirely pretextual, given the numerous statements made in recent weeks by the president and his administration officials who admit to withholding full SNAP benefits for political reasons,” he said.McConnell also noted that the case should be resolved as soon as possible to help provide food to hungry people or “needless suffering will occur.”‘A state problem’Tyler Becker, who argued on behalf of the USDA, said the department had done its part by making available to states a table showing how they should allocate partial November benefits for households of differing circumstances.SNAP is a complex program, requiring coordination between the federal government and all 50 states, each of which has a different system for distributing benefits.“The government did make the payments, is making the payments to the states,” he said. “That's all the government does in the SNAP program.”He added that the government had shown earlier in the case some of the administrative difficulties of paying partial benefits.In a separate case in Massachusetts federal court, some states said they could process the benefits immediately, while others cannot.“This is a state problem,” he said.But McConnell cut him off shortly after, saying the federal government was responsible for ensuring people got their SNAP benefits.“The problem that the government identified needed to be resolved one way or the other by Wednesday,” he said. “And if it wasn't resolved by Wednesday, then you had to make the full payments, because that's the only way we could get money to people immediately and alleviate the irreparable harm, whether you could or couldn't do anything about that.”In a Sept. 30 contingency plan about how to proceed during a government shutdown, the USDA itself said it would pay for continuing benefits through the contingency fund, which at the time held $6 billion. The administration later reversed that plan and said it could not tap the contingency fund.In the Massachusetts case, which was brought by 25 Democratic states and the District of Columbia, the states argued Thursday that confusion stemming from a miscalculation the USDA made in determining November partial benefits was a reason to force the administration to pay for a full month.USDA corrects miscalculationThe hearing followed a late Wednesday night filing from the USDA correcting an error it made in calculating the amounts beneficiaries would receive under its plan for partial payments. The department said it will reduce the largest monthly food assistance payments by about 35% in November, down from a 50% cut the department initially estimated.USDA miscalculated how to adjust benefit payments for SNAP to account for a lack of full funding during the government shutdown, a department official said in a filing to the U.S. District Court for Rhode Island. The formula the government initially used and sent to states Tuesday would have resulted in about a 50% cut to the maximum monthly benefits, and left some households without benefits. SNAP pays benefits on a sliding scale depending on the size of a household, the household’s income and other expenses such as housing.

By cutting the maximum benefit by one-half, the department would have spent about $3 billion from a SNAP contingency fund instead of the full $4.65 billion in the fund, which is what the court ordered it to spend.The error was first reported to U.S. District Chief Judge John J.

Kay Ivey speaks at the Alabama County Commission Association convention at the Perdido Beach Resort in Orange Beach, Alabama, on Aug. 20, 2025. Ivey announced Thursday morning that the state has submitted a plan for the Rural Health Transformation Program to the federal government. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Gov. Kay Ivey on Thursday said the state had submitted a plan to secure public money to offset projected cuts in Medicaid funding.  
The Rural Health Transformation Program is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) that was signed into law this summer. It distributes $50 billion in grants to the states over five years for rural health care. According to a brief from KFF, a national health policy research organization, the fund could partially offset just over a third (37%) of the estimated federal Medicaid spending cuts in rural areas, which are projected to be $137 billion over ten years.
Ivey’s office said in a statement that program will have 11 initiatives: Collaborative Electronic Health Record (EHR), IT and Cybersecurity; Rural Health; Maternal and Fetal Health; Rural Workforce; Cancer Digital Regionalization; Simulation Training; Statewide EMS Trauma and Stroke; EMS Treat-In-Place; Mental Health; Community Medicine; and Rural Health Practice.

The governor’s office did not say Thursday how much funding it was requesting; a message seeking comment was left with a spokesperson for Ivey on Thursday. Additional details on each of the initiatives were not provided, but a group of 20 experts and lawmakers will meet on the proposal on Wednesday. 
“My team left no stone unturned as it gathered information to submit our plan,” Ivey said. “It is a thoughtful, strategic plan that must be coupled with state policy changes to maximize effectiveness. Once implemented, the initiatives and policy changes will make meaningful improvements to healthcare in rural Alabama.”
According to the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center, nine rural hospitals have closed in Alabama since 2009. Only 30% of the state’s rural hospitals have labor and delivery units, leaving many expectant parents to drive long distances for care. Alabama is one of ten states that has not expanded Medicaid. Alabama’s hospitals have long pushed for expansion, saying it would help hospitals on the brink of collapse survive, but Republican leaders have resisted it. 
While Alabama House leaders have signaled openness to a public-private hybrid approach to expansion, the Senate has been hostile, and removed a provision from a 2024 gambling bill that could have provided money for the program.  
The initiatives aim to help rural health care facilities become more financially viable, increase access to critical healthcare services and improve quality of care and patient health outcomes, according to the statement. 
“As someone from Wilcox County, making meaningful improvements in how we deliver health care in rural Alabama is critically important to me,” Ivey said. “Making America Healthy Again begins in rural America, and I look forward to the state and federal governments working together to improve health care across the state.”
Awards are expected by the end of the year, according to the statement, and will be administered by the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs. Half of the $50 billion grant will be evenly distributed to states, with the other half at the discretion of CMS.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0294-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-06 12:03:43.159461

On Wednesday, a jury found Avery Bankston, 38, guilty of first-degree murder for the death of Tyrone Wilson. 
The night of Feb. 23, 2023, the Hinds County Sheriff’s Department and Mississippi Bureau of Investigation found 50-year-old Wilson dead and lying on his back in the cell he shared with Bankston. 
Video camera footage showed both men enter and exit the cell and visible movement from under the cell door: a struggle and a red-sleeved arm reach from under the cell, according to the Hinds County District Attorney’s office. Later, video captured Bankston using a white cloth to clean the inside cell window and door. 
“For our system of law to work, prisons have to be safe. We will not tolerate our detention centers to become battlegrounds,” Hinds District Attorney Jody Owens said in a statement. “Every act of violence behind bars will be prosecuted as aggressively as one on the street.”
Owens said he hopes the verdict will bring closure to Wilson’s family who lives in Illinois and didn’t have the chance to say goodbye to him. 
At the time of the killing, Bankston was being held at the Raymond facility awaiting trial for burglary charges. Charge information for Wilson was not immediately available. 
Bankston’s attorney asked the court to suppress or limit testimony about any alleged previous altercation between Bankston and Wilson as hearsay because no one personally witnessed an altercation, and to limit allegations of Bankston’s prior arrests. 
At least six people have died at the Hinds County Detention Center this year, including the homicide of a man whose body was found in his cell after an apparent assault.

For the past two years, federal clean energy tax credits have offered a welcome relief. Thanks to programs created under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), homeowners across Michigan and the rest of the country were able to save thousands of dollars on solar, home energy efficiency improvements, and other clean energy upgrades. These incentives lowered the cost of everything from rooftop solar systems to home insulation, giving families a chance to reduce their consumption, cut their monthly bills, and insulate themselves from ever rising utility prices.
The scale of the impact was significant. In 2023 alone, more than 3.4 million American families received $8.4 billion in tax credits that reduced the cost of clean energy and efficiency improvements. And many probably don’t realize those solar tax credits pale in comparison to annual subsidies the oil and gas industry continue to receive year after year. Additionally, here in Michigan, more than 117,000 households were among the beneficiaries, collectively saving over $134 million.
These upgrades didn’t just lower bills in the short term; they created lasting savings that will continue for many years to come, along with providing significant benefits to the grid as a whole, reducing demand and helping to slow down ever increasing rate hikes for all Michigan residents.
But now, those credits are being rolled back. Under a recently passed Republican tax bill, key clean energy incentives will expire by the end of this year. Some, like clean vehicle credits worth up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used EVs, have already disappeared. Residential clean energy and home energy efficiency credits will vanish at the end of December.
The result is that families who had been counting on these programs to help with the cost of upgrades will lose access altogether.
The consequences of eliminating these programs are serious. According to an Energy Innovation analysis, the Republican “Big Beautiful Bill” will raise annual energy bills by $20 billion in 2030 and $37 billion by 2035. Instead of giving families tools to lower their bills, the rollback forces them to pay more for the same energy. Experts estimate that, had the credits remained in place, Americans would have saved $38 billion on electricity bills by 2030. Now, those savings are off the table, all while oil and gas corporations will continue to receive $10-40 billion in annual subsidies.
These changes come at a time when energy costs are already rising faster than inflation. Nationally, one in six households is behind on electric or gas bills. The combination of higher rates and the loss of federal support means that more families will face difficult choices about how to cover their energy needs.
There are broader challenges on the horizon as well. Energy demand is increasing sharply, driven in part by the growth of data centers. Between 2021 and 2024, the number of U.S. data centers nearly doubled and grid operators are starting to sound alarms. PJM Interconnection, which oversees power across 13 states, warned for the first time that it may not be able to reliably meet demand in the future. If clean energy investment slows, the pressure on the grid — and on family budgets — will only intensify.
Industry leaders are also voicing concern. Energy companies warn that scaling back clean energy tax credits will make electricity more expensive in the long run. One clean energy CEO put it bluntly: “If you take renewables and storage off the table, we’re going to force electricity prices to the moon.”
For Michigan households, the stakes are clear. Federal clean energy credits have provided real, measurable relief from high energy bills. Without them, families will not only miss out on upfront savings but also face higher costs in the years to come.
The coming months represent a narrowing window of opportunity. Families who were considering clean energy or efficiency upgrades need to be aware that the federal support that has made these projects much more affordable is disappearing. Once the credits expire, so will the chance to capture thousands of dollars in savings. And unfortunately for most this window has passed, as wait times and schedules for installations are pushing into the very end of the year.
The silver lining is the fact that as rates continue to climb, especially during peak demand time frames during summer afternoons, solar alone provides the best path to reduce these spiking demand charges and to be insulated from future rate increases. Because solar produces the most energy for system owners at the exact time when energy costs the most. So, as rates climb faster and faster with demand outpacing supply, solar energy systems will only get more and more valuable in the coming years.
Overall, the bottom line is simple: at a time when utilities are raising rates faster than ever and energy demand is putting pressure on the grid, cutting back on clean energy incentives will only make life harder and more expensive for Michigan families. These programs were designed to lower costs, promote energy independence, and build a stronger grid for the future. Losing them now means losing one of the few tools that has actually worked to keep household energy bills under control.
But, no matter how much pressure is applied to slow solar adoption, it cannot be stopped because the return on investment will simply be too good to overlook with rapidly rising utility rates, and it is one of the keys to unlocking a successful collective future for us all.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/clean-energy-saves-money-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-06 11:04:06.439654

On Wednesday, Put Missouri First reported two $50,000 contributions — one from the National Republican Congressional Committee and the other from the Republican National Committee. It marks the first contributions to the PAC, which was created last week to counter the referendum campaign seeking to put the state’s congressional map on the 2026 ballot.
The Democratic National Committee announced in September that it would contributing staff and financial resources to bolster a referendum effort.
Matt Belz, a St. Louis attorney serving as treasurer of Put Missouri First, could not be immediately reached for comment.
Missouri’s new congressional districts are part of President Donald Trump’s push for Republican states to revise maps to increase the GOP majority in the U.S. House before next year’s midterm elections.
State lawmakers returned to the Missouri Capitol in September to redraw the map to ensure Republicans have an advantage in seven of the state’s eight districts. The new map carves up the 5th District, based in Kansas City and represented by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver since 2005, to make it easier to flip the seat for Republicans.
Immediately after the map was approved, a PAC called People Not Politicians filed a referendum to place it on the ballot. The group has until Dec. 11 to turn in at least 106,000 signatures in order to force a vote on the plan. On Wednesday, it said it had already exceeded 200,000 signatures.
The referendum campaign faces a lawsuit filed by Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway claiming it is unconstitutional and numerous procedural hurdles enacted by the secretary of state’s office.
But People Not Politicians has raised more than $3 million in just two months, mostly from out-of-state groups. And it is getting help from the Missouri AFL-CIO, which led the referendum campaign in 2018 that collected 300,000 signatures and repealed the state’s a right-to-work law.
“We’re continuing to gather signatures because Missourians want their voices to be heard. We will not stop collecting or be deterred,” said Richard von Glahn, executive director of People Not Politicians. “Every attack from politicians trying to silence us brings us more volunteers and more support.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesotans voted on Election Day to approve 60 out of 96 referendums from 70 school districts asking for more funding through higher taxes.
The referendums give more taxpayer dollars to school districts that will use them for operating, building and capital improvements for the state’s schools, including maintaining staffing and academic programs for students.
Several referendums are renewals of previous referendums that expired thanks to the state’s law that referendum funding can only last 10 years, said Kirk Schneidawind, executive director of the Minnesota School Boards Association.
The number of referendums this year was higher than average but not unusually high, Schneidawind said. He added that part of the driving force behind schools needing more money is high inflation “in almost every sector of their business from transportation to labor costs to health insurance.”
School districts are also financially preparing for uncertainty in federal funding, said Monica Byron, president of Education Minnesota, the state’s largest teachers’ union. Byron pointed to cuts in special education services as a particular concern.
St. Paul, one of the largest districts in Minnesota, approved a $32.7 million tax levy for its schools. The tax levy will “help us avoid millions of dollars in budget cuts that would be detrimental to our schools and the people who work so hard to help our students thrive,” St. Paul superintendent Stacie Stanley said in a statement.


Rural and urban school districts alike voted yes — 80% of referendums passed in rural districts, including in small districts such as Badger Public Schools in northwestern Minnesota. Badger, which currently enrolls 223 students according to Minnesota Department of Education data, approved a $429 levy increase per pupil, along with $5.3 million for school building improvements.
“We know that investing in education, especially during these uncertain times, helps our communities build this skilled workforce that we need and can build economic stability,” said Byron of the teachers union.
Also on Tuesday, the state’s largest school district, Anoka-Hennepin, re-elected three incumbents for a politically split six-person school board in an election that received over $400,000 in campaign spending. The north metro school district is split between progressives and conservatives and frequently faces gridlock over budget and curriculum choices, Sahan Journal reported.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250617_0007-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-06 11:04:06.439654

More than a dozen residents since received 'notices to quit.'","Residents of several apartment complexes in New London are facing eviction, just weeks after a corporate landlord purchased the properties.
In October, Shelton-based Alpha Capital Funds bought five apartment complexes in New London previously owned by a local landlord. In total, the buildings have 61 units, according to Connecticut Tenants Union Vice President Luke Melonakos-Harrison.
By late October, more than a dozen residents on month-to-month leases received notices to quit, marking the first step in the eviction process. The evictions are in buildings on Redden Avenue and Williams Street, Melonakos-Harrison said.
“They’ve issued 14 notices to quit so far, and they’ve told the city of New London that they plan to issue 26 total,” Melonakos-Harrison said. “So we’re kind of bracing ourselves to see who else is going to get hit.”
All of the evictions qualify as “no fault,” meaning the new landlord chose not to renew the leases without stating a specified reason. It’s something housing advocates have petitioned against in the state legislature in recent years.
Connecticut’s existing Just Cause eviction law protects residents who are at least 62 years old or have a disability from being evicted from their home without being given a reason, such as nonpayment of rent or a violation of the lease agreement.
Alpha Capital Funds is known for purchasing apartment buildings not listed for sale and seeking evictions or rent raises, according to Melonakos-Harrison. Last year, a similar situation played out in Niantic, Connecticut, when Alpha Capital Funds purchased an apartment complex and tried to increase rents by as much as $900.
Across Connecticut, Alpha Capital Funds owns more than 400 apartments, including buildings in Middletown, Wallingford, Bridgeport and Groton.
The company’s owner, Tyler Smith, is unwilling to recognize the unions or negotiate, according to Melonakos-Harrison. Smith did not agree to an interview with Connecticut Public.
“It’s not only the individual tenants being threatened with eviction who are damaged by this, but it’s the social fabric of neighbors who have developed a safe environment in their long term home,” Melonakos-Harrison said.
So far, the buildings on Redden Avenue and Williams Street banded together to form tenants unions.
Michael Duffy has lived in his Redden Avenue apartment for eight years and received a notice to quit.
“On the back of the notice, it said we are here to help, and it confused the hell out of me, because if you’re here to help, then why are you giving me a notice to quit?” Duffy said.
Duffy said he’s always paid his rent on time and done landscaping maintenance around the property.
Residents are now waiting on Alpha Capital Funds to recognize the unions, or for local lawmakers to try and mitigate.

Read this story in English.
Los subsidios que ayudan a reducir los costos de los planes de salud de la Ley de Cuidado de Salud Asequible (ACA) expirarán a finales de año y, sin la intervención del Congreso, se prevé que las primas aumenten en 2026.
Los subsidios mejorados para las primas han estado en el centro de atención en las últimas semanas debido a la prolongación del cierre del gobierno federal.
Los Demócratas están presionando para que se extiendan nuevamente los subsidios con el fin de asegurar sus votos en un proyecto de ley que reabriría el gobierno y pondría fin al cierre que ya dura un mes. Pero muchos Republicanos lo consideran un gasto excesivo del gobierno y quieren, al menos, abordar el tema por separado de la financiación gubernamental. Se prevé que los aumentos de las primas entren en vigor el próximo año si los créditos fiscales caducan después del 31 de diciembre.
La incertidumbre sobre los créditos fiscales coincide con el inicio del período de inscripción abierta para comprar planes para el próximo año, en el mercado de seguros del Estado, Access Health CT. La inscripción abierta para los planes que entran en vigor a principios del próximo año comenzó el 1 de noviembre y se extiende hasta el 15 de diciembre. Los residentes tienen hasta el 15 de enero para inscribirse en planes que comienzan en febrero.
Esto es lo que necesita saber:
¿Qué son los subsidios y por qué expiran?
Los subsidios mejorados para las primas se crearon en virtud de la Ley del Plan de Rescate Estadounidense, la legislación federal de 2021 que los Demócratas del Congreso aprobaron para brindar ayuda durante la pandemia de COVID-19.
Los inscritos pueden calificar para varios subsidios para reducir los costos de atención médica según sus ingresos. Los hogares que ganan entre el 100% y el 400% del nivel federal de pobreza son elegibles para recibir ayuda financiera para pagar los planes.
El proyecto de ley de 2021 amplió la elegibilidad a quienes ganan más del 400% del nivel federal de pobreza, limitando el costo de un plan de referencia al 8.5% de los ingresos anuales de ese hogar.
Para calificar para cualquier subsidio, debe ser ciudadano estadounidense o tener residencia legal. También debe presentar la declaración de impuestos conjuntamente si está casado.
Según el Plan de Rescate Estadounidense, los subsidios mejorados habrían expirado un año después, en 2022. Pero el Congreso logró extenderlos por otros tres años en virtud de la Ley de Reducción de la Inflación de los Demócratas. Esa ley estableció la expiración de los créditos fiscales para el 31 de diciembre de 2025.
¿Veré un aumento en mis primas si expiran?
Es probable que vea un aumento en su prima si el Congreso no toma ninguna medida antes de fin de año. Para quienes ganan menos del 400% del nivel federal de pobreza, es probable que reciban menos asistencia. Pero aquellos que superen el 400% verán desaparecer por completo su ayuda.
Recientemente se enviaron cartas a las personas que tienen planes a través de Access Health CT informándoles cuánto más podrían tener que pagar cuando expiren los créditos.
Si los subsidios caducan a finales de diciembre, los residentes de Connecticut podrían ver aumentar sus primas en un promedio de $2,380 por año, o alrededor de $198 al mes, según las estimaciones de mediados de octubre proporcionadas por Access Health CT. Un hogar de cuatro personas vería aumentar sus primas en un promedio de más de $10,000 por año.
El mercado de seguros de salud estatal atribuye estos aumentos de primas a la expiración de los subsidios mejorados, además de los aumentos generales de tarifas para los planes de 2026.
Access Health CT dijo que utiliza dos factores para determinar las primas: la edad y el condado. Para las personas mayores, las tarifas de las primas suelen ser más altas porque se espera que utilicen los servicios de salud con más frecuencia.
¿Quiénes se verán afectados en Connecticut?
La expiración de estos subsidios afectaría a quienes compran planes de salud a través de Access Health CT. No afecta a quienes obtienen cobertura a través de planes proporcionados por el empleador, Medicare o Medicaid.
Pero no todos perderán por completo el apoyo financiero y otros subsidios que ayudan a reducir los costos para las personas que compran en el mercado de seguros del Estado.
Alrededor de 143,000 afiliados en Connecticut reciben algún tipo de subsidio para ayudar a cubrir los costos de las primas. De ese número, casi 32,000 afiliados califican para el subsidio mejorado y, por lo tanto, perderían por completo su asistencia financiera el próximo año. Los 111,000 restantes seguirán recibiendo apoyo financiero, pero este disminuirá.
Actualmente, un total de casi $105 millones mensuales se destinan a la reducción de las primas para los afiliados en el Estado.
Los estadounidenses mayores y los jubilados con anticipación podrían experimentar algunos de los mayores aumentos en sus primas, según Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF). De las personas en Connecticut que corren el riesgo de perder toda la ayuda financiera, poco más de un tercio tienen entre 55 y 64 años.
¿Ampliará el Congreso los subsidios antes de fin de año?
Actualmente, el Congreso está inmerso en una prolongada disputa sobre cómo y cuándo abordar la expiración de los subsidios, que es el eje central del conflicto que ha provocado el cierre parcial del gobierno.
No está claro si el Congreso votará para extenderlos o si caducarán el próximo mes. Existe un debate sobre la duración de cualquier prórroga, o incluso sobre si se deben renovar. Algunos Demócratas quieren que sean permanentes. Pero algunos Republicanos que están a favor de su renovación solo quieren una extensión temporal y límites de ingresos.
Los Demócratas quieren abordar la extensión de los créditos fiscales al mismo tiempo que la financiación a corto plazo, conocida como resolución continua, para mantener el gobierno en funcionamiento. En su propia versión del proyecto de ley de financiación, los Demócratas buscan que los subsidios sean permanentes, entre otras disposiciones relacionadas con la atención médica y Medicaid.
Los Republicanos por su parte, argumentan que deberían tratarse por separado. El liderazgo Republicano no ha apoyado la extensión de los subsidios, pero algunos miembros del partido sí lo han hecho. Existe un proyecto de ley liderado por los Republicanos que los extendería por un año más, el cual ha sido rechazado en gran medida por los Demócratas.
Debido a la incertidumbre sobre lo que hará el Congreso y al cierre parcial del gobierno, los funcionarios de Connecticut han recomendado posponer la inscripción inmediata en los planes de 2026 para ver si la situación se resuelve.
“Si pueden, esperen un poco más”, dijo James Michel, director ejecutivo de Access Health CT, a finales de octubre. “En lugar de inscribirse el 1 de noviembre, denle más tiempo, porque sé que se están llevando a cabo conversaciones para intentar resolver el tema de los subsidios”.

(Photo by Rob Levine for The Minnesota Reformer)TOPEKA — China’s plan to increase soybean and sorghum purchases moved the market in a positive direction and gave Kansas farmers a measure of relief amid high input prices and tariff challenges.
“It was great to see that America’s farmers, our soybean producers especially, were a priority in conversation last week with China,” said Kaleb Little, CEO of the Kansas Soybean Association. “September 1 started that new crop year, and up until last week, China had bought zero new crop soybeans from the U.S.”
China has traditionally been the largest international purchaser of U.S. soybeans, but this year’s trade tariffs caused the country to cancel all purchases.
China buys 20% to 25%, or about 25 to 30 million metric tons, of the U.S. soybean crop in any given year, Little said. Trade agreements made in Washington, D.C., last week indicate China committed to purchasing 25 million metric tons of soybeans annually from 2026 through 2028, and this year they will buy 12 million metric tons, he said.
That leaves sales to make up this year, and Little said the soybean industry is diversifying and expanding sales to other countries. About half of U.S. soybeans are sold domestically and the other half internationally, he said.
 
Sorghum crops
China also pledged to resume sorghum purchases, which Kansas State University grain economist Daniel O’Brien said on K-State’s Grain Outlook program offers potential relief to Kansas farmers who are at least able to cover production costs with current prices.
Kansas is the leading sorghum-producing state, planting 3 million acres of the grain crop, and produces a direct economic impact to the state of $686 million, according to K-State’s extension office.
“We take whatever we can get over direct costs of production for grain sorghum and then we apply it to machinery and to land and to family living,” O’Brien said. “I think the thing to watch over the next month or so will be the strength with which China would come into the sorghum market.”
If China comes into the market with enough purchases to improve prices, that could mean improved sales for Kansas farmers, who have had a good crop this year, O’Brien said.
 
Missing federal reports
The federal government regularly puts out agricultural reports on a variety of topics that help farmers make decisions and various entities track ag production.
But the government shutdown has canceled multiple reports, including crop reports that Little usually accesses to understand where Kansas soybean farmers are in their harvest. Anecdotally, he believes farmers have harvested 60 to 70% of their crop, which is about typical for this time of year, Little said.
In the K-State crop program, O’Brien expressed concern that lack of federal reports could affect farmers and their decision-making processes well into next year, depending on when the government shutdown ends.
For instance, information isn’t available on whether hard red winter wheat exports are strong, something usually available on a weekly basis from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, O’Brien said.
“I think we’ve no doubt had some buying, but I’d be really curious to see once we do get that information back, what the pace had continued to be during that time frame,” he said.
Even more concerning is that right now is when the USDA agricultural statistics teams would be going to field to collect samples for yields.
“They’d be sending out surveys to farmers to find out what their expectations are, what they’ve observed from their harvest numbers,” he said.
That process would have started Nov. 1, and the information would have contributed to important reports that would come out in mid-November.
But the missing data will probably “push” reports out to reports that normally occur in December.
“We typically don’t have much happening during that report, but given the different extraordinary circumstances we’re facing this year, the importance of that December report could be really heightened,” O’Brien said.
If that report is also delayed and crop production numbers aren’t available in December, O’Brien said, the uncertainty could cause crop volatility if farmers are unsure of data they use to make decisions.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/soybean_harvest_4-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-11-06 10:17:43.203462

Pelosi had a hand in crafting what was known as Proposition 50  in California to redraw the state's congressional districts, in response to Republican redistricting efforts in Texas to gain more GOP seats in the House.  The remap passed, and Democrats swept major state races across the country, including the governorships in Virginia and New Jersey.In a video posted to social media, Pelosi, 85, thanked her constituents in her San Francisco congressional district. “I will not be seeking reelection to Congress,” Pelosi said. “With a grateful heart, I look forward to my final year in service as your proud representative.""",,,,2025-11-06 09:57:01.341274

Her retirement, which comes amid Democrats’ cries for a new generation of leadership, sets the stage for a showdown between a progressive challenger and a well-known moderate state senator. 


Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, the trailblazing lawmaker who made history as the first woman to lead the U.S. House of Representatives and a singular force in Democratic politics, announced Thursday that she will retire at the end of 2026 and not seek a 21st term in Congress. 
Pelosi, 85, who has represented San Francisco in the House since 1987, announced her decision Thursday in a nearly six-minute cinematic love letter to the city and her constituents. 
“I’ve always honored the song of St. Francis — ‘Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace,’ — the anthem of our city,” Pelosi, who is a devout Catholic, says near the end of the mini film. “That is why I want you, my fellow San Franciscans, to be the first to know: I will not be seeking re-election to Congress.”
Interspersed with the montage of San Francisco scenes were nods to Pelosi’s signature legislative accomplishments, including the passage of the Affordable Care Act under President Barack Obama and the passage of former President Joe Biden’s infrastructure and climate agenda. 
Pelosi is known for her political prowess, strict leadership and laser-focused vision that made her an exceptionally effective and fearsome speaker. She frequently twisted arms within her own party, quelling an uprising from the progressive flank of the Democratic caucus known as “the Squad” in 2018 and even backchanneling the pressure campaign that led to Biden’s exit from the 2024 presidential race.

She also gained a reputation for her not-so-subtle sass of President Donald Trump, going viral for ripping up his State of the Union speech and mockingly giving him the now-iconic “Nancy clap” of disapproval. Her antagonism of the president also made her a target for political violence. When Jan. 6 rioters stormed the Capitol in 2021, many were looking for her specifically. Pelosi’s husband of more than 60 years, Paul Pelosi, was brutally beaten by an intruder with a hammer who’d broken into the couple’s San Francisco residence looking for her. 
Her video features clever shout-outs to the wide array of industries and interests that have supported — and tangled with — her over the years: labor unions, tech companies, public transit and housing advocates, environmentalists and entrepreneurs. She also notes the city’s struggles, focusing on the recovery from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the AIDS crisis. 
“Here we don’t fear the future, we forge it,” Pelosi says. “From the Gold Rush to the miracles of science and technology, our city has always been the cradle of innovation, buzzing with optimism and creativity.”
Pelosi is a longtime force of the city and the Democratic Party, serving as chair of the California party from 1981 to 1983. She raised five children and was active as a volunteer in local politics for years, but didn’t seriously consider running for office until her 40s. She has spoken often of her Catholic upbringing in Baltimore, where her father served as mayor for 12 years. Her brother later followed in his footsteps. 
Her announcement comes amid an outcry from Democrats to let a younger generation take the helm. State Sen. Scott Wiener, who has called Pelosi his mentor, announced last month that he would seek her seat next year. 
Wiener joins a race that also includes progressive challenger Saikat Chakrabarti, the former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York. 
Her idyllic video notably steers clear of any mention of Trump, who has threatened repeatedly to send troops and immigration agents to San Francisco.
“San Francisco, know your power,” Pelosi says. “We have made history, we have made progress, we have always led the way, and now we must continue to do so.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/062323_Nancy_Pelosi_REUTERS_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-06 09:16:40.919024

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The number of people working in Alaska’s famed seafood industry has set a new record low, surpassing last year’s record low, according to figures published this month by the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development in its magazine, Alaska Economic Trends.
In 2024, an average of 5,393 people were employed as fishers, processors or other seafood workers each month in Alaska, wrote analyst Joshua Warren. That’s down by 443 jobs from the same figure in 2023.
Alaska remains the No. 1 seafood producer among U.S. states, according to federal statistics, and produces more seafood than every other state combined.
The state department of labor has kept a monthly tally of seafood jobs in the state since 2001, and industry employment has been in a steady decline since 2019 due to a variety of factors, including a lack of available fish, competition from cheaper international sources, and high operating costs that can make fishing uneconomic. 
Since the start of 2001, the high point of fishing employment was in 2015, when an average of 8,501 people were employed in the seafood industry each month.
Historically, seafood employment was significantly higher due to reduced rates of automation and the fact that Alaska seafood tended to be processed and packaged locally. 
The modern trend has been toward direct export and processing internationally, where wages are lower.
Seafood employment in Alaska is extremely seasonal, with a peak in June and July during the salmon season and a low ebb in December, before a new season of fishing in federal waters offshore.
In July 2024, only 17,361 people worked in the Alaska seafood industry, the lowest annual peak on record since January 2021. In July 2013, the highest peak, more than 25,000 people were employed in the state’s seafood industry.

Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
Career and technical education programs in Washtenaw County will get a big boost after voters approved a tax increase to add a new funding stream for the programs.
The passage of the special tax proposal may be a good sign across Michigan, given that 41% of schools have limited CTE opportunities for students. The Michigan Department of Education describes these areas as CTE deserts, because data show participation in career tech programs is lower than expected. Tax measures like the one that passed Tuesday in Washtenaw County mean the career programs will have a steady stream of funding.
The proposal passed with 35,947 votes in favor and 29,676 opposed.The tax measure will last 10 years, at which voters would have to approve renewing it.
“This investment by our community will help shape a generation of hope,” said Ryan Rowe, the career and technical education director for the Washtenaw Intermediate School District.
“Our goal is for every student to cross the stage at graduation with an informed and inspired plan for what comes next, whether it’s college, an apprenticeship, the military, or a high-skill career,” Rowe said. “This funding allows us to build stronger pathways, connect learning to the real world, and help students see their future within reach.”
The outcome wasn’t as good for school districts that are part of the Cheboygan-Otsego-Presque Isle intermediate school district in northern Michigan. A similar career and technical education tax proposal failed, according to the Cheboygan Tribune. It would have allowed for the expansion of CTE programs and for funding to allow students to travel to and from school districts in the three counties to take CTE classes.
CTE is particularly limited in Washtenaw County. A report from the University of Michigan’s Youth Policy Lab said access in the county is inequitable, and that students from low-income homes and Black and Hispanic students “have less overall access to CTE programming compared” to more affluent and white students.
At Ypsilanti Community High School, Principal Chelsea Harris-Hugan told Chalkbeat last month that the school would add more CTE programs based on student interest if the measure passes.
“The millage is incredibly important to our students and to our community,” she said. “It provides a bigger pathway and a better opportunity for our students.”
Officials from the Washtenaw Intermediate School District, which will oversee the funding from the tax measure, told Chalkbeat recently that the additional money will allow the ISD to sustain current programs across the county, expand those with waitlists, and create new regional programs. Much of the initial efforts will expand access in Ypsilanti and Whitmore Lake school districts, because they have significantly fewer CTE opportunities than other districts.

From CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday considered whether President Donald Trump is exceeding his authority in imposing wide-ranging tariffs on imports from most of the rest of the world.
The nation’s highest court heard arguments about the Trump administration’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify his tariffs. Some justices expressed skepticism about the president’s ability to act on tariffs unilaterally.

Chief Justice John Roberts: “Imposition of taxes on Americans … has always been the core power of Congress. So, to have the president’s foreign affairs power trump that, that basic power for Congress seems to me to kind of at least neutralize between the two powers, the executive power and the legislative power.”

California filed a similar lawsuit over Trump’s tariffs earlier this year. That suit is essentially on hold pending the high court’s decision on this case, which was brought by a dozen other states and some small businesses. 

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, outside the Supreme Court after arguments on Wednesday: “American people deserve not to be the victim of unlawful taxes. Tariffs are taxes.”

The Consumer Technology Association, whose members include some of California’s biggest tech companies, co-submitted an amicus brief with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The president’s tariffs are “causing irreparable harm” to the groups’ members and in some cases are “threatening their very existence,” they said in the brief.
If the Supreme Court decides the president does not have wide-ranging tariff authority under the law he has cited, the U.S. government will have to issue an estimated $90 billion in refunds to businesses that have paid the tariffs — which Justice Amy Coney Barrett speculated would be “a complete mess.”

Prop. 50 serves multiple purposes for Newsom

For years Gov. Gavin Newsom fended off speculations that he was eyeing the presidency, an ambition that appeared to be a longshot at many points during his governance. But Proposition 50 has catapulted the governor onto the national stage again — and potentially as a frontrunner for the Democratic presidential candidacy.
As CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang explains, Newsom’s national prominence wasn’t always a guarantee, despite his efforts to confront Republicans outside of California, such as debating them on Fox News. In 2023, he urged other states to follow his lead for a constitutional amendment on gun control, though none heeded the call.
But since Prop. 50, Newsom’s national standing has risen: This year, for the first time, he acknowledged he’s considering a possible run for president. The tens of thousands of new nationwide donors who supported his ballot measure could also now serve as a roster of supporters for a potential campaign. And in his Prop. 50 victory speech on Tuesday, he called on other Democratic-led states to advance their own redistricting efforts — and essentially follow his lead.

Celinda Lake, Democratic pollster and strategist: “It was a really outside-the-box idea, implemented well, implemented fast, united the party. And it also showed he was tough.”

CA Republicans plan legal action against Prop. 50

Speaking of Prop. 50, CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller dives into the notable takeaways of its overwhelming victory and what comes next for California.
Hours after Prop. 50 passed, the California Republican Party said it plans to sue over Prop. 50, arguing that it is unconstitutional because it carves out districts in favor of Latino voters, at the expense of other ethnic groups. The U.S. Supreme Court could also issue an upcoming ruling that would give Republicans a big advantage in the South.
Five California Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives are also at a higher risk of losing reelection next year, raising questions about whether they should run in their current, redrawn district; switch to a new one; or drop out entirely. 
That includes Rep. Ken Calvert, whose 41st District that he has represented for more than 30 years in Riverside County will be redrawn eastward into Los Angeles County. On Wednesday he said he would run for reelection in the neighboring 40th District, setting up an intraparty clash with GOP incumbent Rep. Young Kim.

California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: With paperwork to run for California’s next governor opening next month, the field of would-be Newsom successors is even cloudier — especially since U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla decided to opt out of the race.
More Walters: The passage of Prop. 50 has kicked off a litany of political and possibly legal maneuvers that will determine whether increasing Democratic congressional members becomes reality.

Gavin Newsom has been looking for a way to win national attention. Proposition 50 puts him “light-years ahead.”,"In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom has been looking for a way to win national attention. Proposition 50 puts him “light-years ahead.”


Gov. Gavin Newsom has a message for Democrats around the country: Follow my lead. 
Declaring victory for Proposition 50, his Democratic redistricting ballot measure, he named five other states led by Democrats and urged their governors to tilt their own congressional maps in favor of the party and help it secure the U.S. House in next year’s midterms. 
“We need to see other states, their remarkable leaders that have been doing remarkable things, meet this moment head-on as well,” he said. “We can de facto end Donald Trump’s presidency as we know it, the minute Speaker Jeffries gets sworn in as speaker of the House of Representatives. It is all on the line.”
It had the decisive air of a politician claiming the national mantle. And though he nodded to House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries’s role, the subtext was clear: Newsom was the one who just delivered the party the likelihood of five new seats in Congress. 
With Prop. 50’s overwhelming passage, the governor has vaulted — for the moment — into the role of Democratic favorite in the 2028 presidential campaign. Newsom’s national ambitions have never been veiled, but this year he for the first time acknowledged he’s considering it. Having amassed more than tens of thousands of new donors nationwide to support his ballot measure, he also now has a roster of supporters to call on in a potential campaign.
Cable news shows lit up with mentions of the governor’s success at pulling off the redistricting gambit. MSNBC commentator and former Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill declared Newsom has “moved to the front of the pack” among potential 2028 Democratic presidential contenders  such as Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker. 
“He’s in the top tier,” said Democratic pollster and strategist Celinda Lake. “It was a really outside-the-box idea, implemented well, implemented fast, united the party. And it also showed he was tough.”
Yet one victory in an off-year election driven by the nationwide mood of angry Democrats decidedly set against Trump does not necessarily predict a future successful campaign. Prop. 50 was purely anti-Trump, and Democratic strategist Matt Rodriguez said Democrats still need an independent vision to win back Congress or the White House. 
But looking at possible 2028 contenders, “there’s no question (Newsom is) light years ahead of everyone else.”
“He’s the only one driving his own news,” he said. “Everyone else is like a moth to flame.”
‘Iterating’ a vision and a message
Newsom’s prospects for national prominence weren’t always so bright. For years, he’s been experimenting with how to get attention by confronting Republicans on the national stage, challenging them to debates on Fox News and bankrolling red-state billboards advertising California’s reproductive rights. In 2023 he similarly called on other states’ lawmakers to follow his lead for a constitutional amendment on gun control. No other state joined the effort.
In the first few months of 2025, as Democrats struggled with how to recover from the 2024 loss to Trump, Newsom was podcasting with right-wing activists and mulling their successes. It was the latest in a series of his efforts to try on new political approaches, which the governor frequently describes to reporters as “iterating.”
When Texas Democrats approached Newsom for support over the summer as they tried to fight off a Trump-backed GOP gerrymandering effort there, a counter-proposal from California was considered an extraordinary political risk for the governor. 
It wasn’t clear all Democrats in California’s congressional delegation or the state Legislature were on board, let alone a majority of the state’s voters. But by the end of a 10-week campaign, so many people had donated to support the measure that Newsom told them to stop sending money, while two opposition campaigns failed to capture attention with a cohesive message. 
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen the entirety of the left of politics in California come together in this way in a campaign,” said Neel Sannappa, an organizer with the left-wing California Working Families Party and chair of the California Democrats’ Progressive Caucus.
A knack for trolling
Newsom succeeded, strategists said, by taking a risk in an almost impromptu way that was well-timed with voters’ mounting alarms about Trump’s deployment of the National Guard to American cities, aggressive immigration raids and redistricting efforts in other states. 
It didn’t hurt his own standing that he was also engaging in a social media trolling campaign against Trump, adding to perceptions that he was willing to embrace the brash, unconventional politics that led to the president’s own rise. The posts — often AI-generated, sometimes crude, and always extremely online — have delighted Democrats in a way even skeptical progressives like Sannappa commended. 
“He was thrust into the spotlight as a result of this particular situation (with Texas) and I think he made the most of it,” said Brian Brokaw, a strategist who advises Newsom. “One of his greatest strengths is his ability to evolve with changing times and changing dynamics … It’s reflected in the positive results of last night.”
Months ago, Newsom already acknowledged that one day the tweets will get old, and he would need a new strategy.
“We’re iterating,” he said at an August event hosted by Politico. “That’s been the cause of my life.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110425_Newsom-Election_JK_CM_04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-06 09:02:21.592601

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Funding for a Head Start program in South Dakota is delayed because of the federal government shutdown, forcing the program to obtain its own temporary funding and consider a potential closure next month.
Aberdeen-based Northeast South Dakota Head Start expected to receive just over $3 million on Nov. 1 for its fiscal year 2026. The program is funded almost entirely by the federal government, serving 265 children and employing 70 people in eight towns across 13 counties. Children from low-income families receive free early learning, health and family well-being services. 
The program remains open because of a line of credit through Dacotah Bank, said Juli Schultz, executive director of Northeast South Dakota Head Start. The credit will cover the cost of food and staff salaries for November.
States, donors and schools scramble to keep Head Start centers open — for now

If the shutdown continues into December, Schultz said the program will temporarily close.
“The shutdown needs to stop. People here are not puppets,” Schultz said. “What’s happening is they’re playing with our lives, and they just need to move forward.”
Head Start programs are funded annually, though at different times of the year. If the shutdown lasts until December or later, more programs would see their funding run out. 
Eight of South Dakota’s 16 Head Start programs are tribally operated. None of the other non-tribal Head Start programs has been affected yet, said Schultz, who is president of the South Dakota Head Start Association board. South Dakota Searchlight reached out to all tribal organizations, with three responding that their grants have not yet been impacted.
Nationally, about 140 Head Start programs have been affected since the beginning of the shutdown last month; 21 programs in 18 states and Puerto Rico have closed temporarily, according to the National Head Start Association. Other programs have not been affected yet, or have stayed open thanks to a line of credit or because they’ve been able to secure funding through philanthropic organizations.










The shutdown needs to stop. People here are not puppets. What’s happening is they’re playing with our lives, and they just need to move forward.


– Juli Schultz, Northeast South Dakota Head Start


Launched six decades ago as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty, Head Start programs provide a range of services beyond early education, such as medical and dental screenings, school meals and family support to children from low-income households who can’t afford other child care options. Northeast South Dakota Head Start provides preschool classes, along with breakfast, lunch and a snack.
Schultz said the federal government had never previously failed to fund her program by the beginning of the Nov. 1 grant cycle. 
Schultz worries about the effects on children and families if she has to temporarily close the program next month. In addition to providing many children “one main nutritious meal” for most of the week, Head Start is a safe space for children and provides families with child care and help accessing resources within the state and community.

For many of them, the cost will go up next year if Congress doesn’t extend particular tax credits.","Senate Minority Assistant Whip Jen Plumb, D-Salt Lake City, is pictured on the first day of the legislative session at the Capitol in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, Jan. 16, 2024. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)More than 1 in 10 Utahns relies on the Affordable Care Act marketplace for health coverage. For many of them, the cost will go up next year if Congress doesn’t extend particular tax credits. 
On Wednesday, a Democrat in the Utah Legislature and two in Congress urged Republicans in Washington, D.C. to agree to keep the subsidies going so Utahns don’t get priced out. The enhanced tax credits are at the center of the federal government shutdown, the longest in the nation’s history. 
Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said in a virtual news conference that more than 421,000 Utahns get their health insurance through the marketplace.

Brian Schatz. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)
If the subsidies end, a 60-year-old Utah couple earning about $83,000 will see their premiums increase by more than $19,000 per year, Klobuchar said. For a family of four bringing in $64,000, she said the cost would triple, going up by more than $2,500. 
“That’s a real gut punch,” Klobuchar said, reiterating points she’s made recently in North Carolina and Iowa. 
With the end date approaching, Salt Lake City filmmaker Stan Clawson said he’s worried. 
“I’m really looking to the future, as many other people are, and wondering, will I be able to afford a doubling of my premiums?” Clawson said during the news conference. 
Clawson fell 49 feet while rock climbing almost 30 years ago, injuring his spinal cord and paralyzing him below the mid-torso, he said. He uses a wheelchair and catheters, and his insurance helps keep the costs of medical equipment low.  
Still, he’s spent about $12,000 out of pocket on medical expenses this year, he said, on an income of about $42,000.

“This tax credit going away really impacts me and my business,” Clawson said. 
State Sen. Jen Plumb, D-Salt Lake City, said Utah’s hospitals and emergency rooms will take on a bigger burden if thousands drop their insurance because it’s too expensive. 
Plumb, an emergency room pediatrician, said she already sees patients on a routine basis who can’t afford coverage and wait until they’re in crisis to seek medical attention.
“This isn’t like an abstract policy concept,” Plumb said. “It’s what we see on the faces of patients every shift.” 
Sen. Ron. Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, foresees ripple effects. Even those insured through their jobs, not the Affordable Care Act, could see their rates go up due to cost shifting, Wyden said. 
Some Republicans, including Utah Sen. John Curtis, have said the enhanced credits were meant to be a short-term solution during the COVID-19 pandemic and keeping them in place could add to rising health care costs. 
“A lot of Republicans are very sympathetic to increasing premiums. We’d love to have a discussion about that,” Curtis told reporters last month. But he does not believe the current enhanced subsidies should continue for those at four times the poverty level, he said – $63,600 for an individual; $128,600 for a household of four. 
Utah Republican Rep. Mike Kennedy, a physician, told reporters on Monday that he wants to see the premium increases discussed in Congress, but blamed Senate Democrats for not opening the government first.
“To me, this is an essential issue for us to work through, and I’m committed to understanding how important these premium increases are to people,” Kennedy said. “Not to negate the issue, but as we debate and discuss that issue, if you would like to tell me why five Democrats aren’t willing to open up the Senate side of the government, and then we can have these discussions.”
Klobuchar said the COVID-19 pandemic did drive up medical costs, and “our job is to make this affordable, and it’s not affordable when the premiums double.”
With a monthly average tax credit of $463, the monthly average marketplace plan premium for Utah residents is $70, according to a report from the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute.

Without an extension of enhanced tax credits for the Affordable Care Act, Alabamians will see a surge in premium costs.(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Alabamians could see major surges in the cost of Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans without enhanced tax credits for ACA premiums, which lie at the center of the federal government shutdown. 
According to a report from KFF, a nonprofit health policy research organization, ACA premiums are estimated to increase 114% on average nationwide. 
An analysis by KFF found that most of ACA enrollees live in Republican Congressional districts and in states won by President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. In Alabama, about 478,000 people, about 9.3% of the population, get insurance through the Affordable Care Act.  
The number is about 10.5% in Alabama’s 1st Congressional District, represented by Barry Moore, R-Enterprise, and in the 2nd Congressional District, represented by Shomari Figures, D-Mobile. 
Debbie Smith, the director of Alabama Arise’s initiative Cover Alabama, said in an interview Wednesday that while a 114% increase is the average, she has heard from Alabamians whose monthly premiums will increase by 980%.
“We also have someone who reported in from DeKalb County that her current premium is $35.33 and it will go up to $343 in 2026,” she said. “Almost 10 times the amount.”
She said another ACA participant in Geraldine, also in DeKalb County, who works at a small business will have a $636 monthly premium. In 2025, it was $363 per month.
For the most part, ACA enrollees in Alabama are employed, but their employers don’t offer insurance. Some are older enrollees who are not eligible for Medicare yet. She said the yearly premium for a 60-year-old couple making $85,000 per year will increase from $7,000 to $32,000 per year. 
“That’s insane, $7,000 to $32,000, you might as well not even have health coverage at that point. And I’d say that’s a pretty moderate income for a household of two,” Smith said. “So where else are these individuals supposed to go?”
The tax credit that Democrats in Congress want to keep allows anybody to purchase health care through the government. It was established by Democrats in 2021 as part of a  COVID-19 relief package, and was extended in 2022 through the Inflation Reduction Act. They are set to expire at the end of 2025.
The possible loss of the premiums are at the heart of the federal government shutdown that began in early October. Republicans, who do not have the votes to overcome a Senate filibuster, want to pass a budget bill. Democrats said they will not pass a bill without an extension of the credits. Republicans say they will not discuss extensions until a budget bill is in place.
The tax credits currently allow those enrollees to have no premium in a silver plan, which has “moderate” deductibles, according to healthcare.gov. Smith said that 252,644 Alabamians fall in this category, about half of all Alabamians enrolled in the ACA.
“A lot more people being uninsured like that is not good for, obviously the people who are impacted, who don’t have access to healthcare, being able to see a doctor when they want to, but also for the system as a whole,” Smith said.
Without the enhanced tax credits, only Americans who make less than 400% of the federal poverty level will be able to purchase coverage. That is an annual income of about $62,600 for an individual and $106,600 for a family of three.
While Cover Alabama does not keep track of how many Alabamians enrolled in Obamacare make less than 400% of the poverty level, Smith said she is more concerned about those who make between 100% and 138%.
“If they lived in a different state, they would be on Medicaid. Since we haven’t expanded Medicaid, healthcare.gov, fills in the gaps for us big time,” Smith said.

Padilla elects not to run for governor, leaving a cloudy field of candidates",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/11/senator-padilla-run-for-governor/,Sen. Alex Padilla joins other prominent people who elected to not seek California's highest office. Now there's no clear frontrunner — so far.,"In 362 days California voters will choose a new governor. That’s just around the corner in political terms, given the expense and organizational lift a statewide campaign requires in the nation’s most populous state.
The winner almost certainly will be — as certain as anything in politics can be — a Democrat. If nothing else, the passage of Proposition 50, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s mid-decade congressional district gerrymander, confirms anew that California is a one-party state.
But which Democrat?
As the 2026 election cycle gears up — candidates can start filing paperwork next month — the field of would-be successors to Newsom is becoming even cloudier.
U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, who political media had been portraying as leaning toward running for governor, abruptly dropped out of consideration Tuesday during a Washington press conference to discuss the federal government shutdown.
“It is with a full heart and even more commitment than ever that I am choosing to not run for governor of California next year,” Padilla said. “I choose not just to stay in the Senate, I choose to stay in this fight.”
Had he opted-in, Padilla would have been the immediate frontrunner. By opting-out, he adds himself to the list of seemingly heavyweight contenders who decided governing California isn’t an attractive career move.
Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis was the first to go, dropping out in August, four months after announcing her candidacy. She was followed by former Vice President Kamala Harris, who wrote a book to explain how she failed to win the presidency last year. Toni Atkins, former president pro tem of the state Senate, also exited, acknowledging she probably couldn’t succeed.
Padilla’s decision leaves a handful of announced Democratic hopefuls still running, but none with anything close to dominant status, along with a few more potentials who have yet to declare one way or the other.
Of those who have announced, former Congresswoman Katie Porter had an early lead in polling, although under 20% support, but she was heavily damaged when videos surfaced of her harsh reaction to a reporter’s question and snapping at one of her staffers. Porter apologized but the incidents undermined her likeability, no small thing in political terms. 
At the moment, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Attorney General and Biden cabinet member Xavier Becerra seem to have the best prospects among the declared candidates, but once again we’re waiting for other potential candidates to get in or get out.
All eyes are on businessman Rick Caruso, who’s weighing whether to seek the governorship or run again for mayor of Los Angeles. He lost his first mayoral bid to Karen Bass, but her popularity has waned due to her handling of the city’s disastrous fires.
Austin Beutner, a businessman and former superintendent of Los Angeles Unified School District, has already declared that he’ll challenge Bass, which puts some pressure on Caruso to make his intentions known.
Wealthy investor Tom Steyer, who ran for president in 2020, pumped millions of dollars into his own campaign for Proposition 50, sparking speculation he might run for governor.
Caruso and Steyer could easily finance campaigns for governor, freeing themselves from the chore of raising money and thus incurring political debts to supporters. That alone would make them viable candidates.
Former state Controller Betty Yee and Tony Thurmond, the state superintendent of schools, are still declared candidates but don’t appear to be gaining traction.
Finally, there’s some buzz in political media about Bay Area Congressman Eric Swalwell, after one private poll included his name.
Until the field becomes clearer, political media, would-be campaign contributors and California voters will just have to twiddle their thumbs.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/092425_Padilla-SD-Court_AH_CM_06.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-06 08:17:08.918036

Joe Lombardo. (Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo is slated to attend a $5,000-a plate fundraiser in his honor Thursday in Washington, D.C., as close to half a million Nevadans struggle to make do with a fraction of federal food assistance benefits, another 100,000 face the prospect of unaffordable health insurance, and an unknown number lose jobs or go unpaid as a result of the federal government shutdown. 
President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans have refused to negotiate with Senate Democrats, who have thus far held fast against passing a continuing resolution to reopen the government unless Republicans negotiate a plan to address skyrocketing Affordable Care Act premiums. Expanded premium tax credits that previously made policies affordable are set to expire at the end of the year, leaving some with lower credits and higher premiums, while others lose eligibility for the subsidy. 
Nevadans who get their health care through the ACA could see premiums increase by 26%, though Democrats as well as industry researchers warn the additional costs will be much higher for many people if they no longer receive enhanced premium tax credits. A 60 year-old couple in Nevada could see annual premiums rise by $18,100, the New York Times reported last month.
In addition to curtailed food assistance programs and rising costs, Nevada is confronting other economic headwinds, including visitation to Las Vegas plunging 8.8% in September, the ninth straight month of declines this year. Would-be tourists are contending with uncertainty as industry and government officials juggle a barrage of presidential edicts, including aggressive immigration enforcement actions, and shutdown fallout, such as a shortage of air traffic controllers.
Last week, Trump directed the government to renew nuclear weapons testing, which took place for decades at the Nevada Test Site, just 65 miles from Las Vegas. Lombardo, who said last year he opposed revived testing, has not commented on Trump’s directive.
Lombardo’s office did not respond when asked whether the governor considered cancelling his fundraiser in light of challenges facing Nevadans. 
Special session looms
The governor’s trip comes amid criticism from members of Nevada’s congressional delegation and State Treasurer Zach Conine regarding Lombardo’s response to the loss of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funds, and as state lawmakers wait to learn when he will schedule an anticipated special session of the Nevada Legislature, and whether augmenting SNAP will be on the agenda. 
Attorney General Aaron Ford, a contender in the Democratic primary for governor, joined other Democratic attorneys general in suing the Trump administration for suspending SNAP payments, and won. 
Ford’s campaign declined to comment on Lombardo’s trip to D.C. 
Invitation to Lombardo fundraiser.
“Lombardo is doing exactly what we’ve learned to expect from him in this moment of crisis. He’s gone and kissing Trump’s ring,” Washoe County Commission Chairperson Alexis Hill, who is also running in the Democratic primary race for governor, said via text. “This state needs leadership. There’s no place I’d rather be than serving my community in Nevada.” 
There was no indication Lombardo was expected to see Trump while in Washington.
It’s the second time in recent months that Lombardo has put critical state business on the back burner and prioritized his reelection effort over an emergency. 
In August, the governor missed the first news conference on a cyberattack of state computer systems and the resulting shutdown of state government offices to attend a campaign event in Elko. Some government services were disrupted for weeks.    
‘Problem-solving outsiders’
“I sure hope the people of Clark County know how hard I’m working,” then-Sheriff Lombardo told the Current in 2022 when he was running for governor. A review of data from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department at the time indicated Lombardo was showing up at the office roughly three times a week over a 14-month period, from Jan. 1, 2021 through March 25, 2022, during his first campaign for governor. 
Lombardo, who generally mentions Washington D.C. only to note its tangled bureaucracy, is being hosted at an undisclosed location by former Republican Governors Association Executive Director Phil Cox, according to an invitation provided to the Current.  
Cox, who has led numerous Republican campaigns, is an opponent of expanded Medicaid, and as head of the RGA, opposed the Affordable Care Act and issued statements from Republican governors in opposition. 
In 2013, Cox told The Hill a then-ongoing federal government shutdown “is giving Republican governors with White House ambitions a new opportunity to burnish their credentials as problem-solving outsiders armed with solutions to Washington’s dysfunction.”
Last year, Cox began a leadership role at America PAC, which was founded and funded by Elon Musk to support Trump’s 2024 campaign to the tune of $250 million.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pondrous-joe-1024x731.jpg,,,2025-11-06 08:17:08.918036

Lawmakers said that Tuberville is politicizing the situation, while also faulting Republicans for enacting laws that made the city more vulnerable to violent crime, particularly gun violence.
“Cities are not ‘war zones,’” said Rep. Kenyatte Hassell, D-Montgomery, in an interview on Monday. “It is an injustice to say that about any of our cities. We have working-class citizens who work in the city every day. I live in Montgomery. I don’t hear gun shots every day.”

Alabama’s senior senator made the remarks in a video released on Oct. 27, referencing a mass shooting that left two people dead and 12 injured.
“We are not a third world country,” Tuberville said in the video. “But Montgomery has been turned into a war zone. We must take ACTION to keep Alabamians safe.”
In the video Tuberville also said that “residents need to feel safe in our capital city, and right now that is not the case.” He then said he would help make the downtown area a “safe zone.”
The senator has had a history of making inflammatory and racist statements.
In 2022, he compared the descendants of those who were once enslaved to criminals. Earlier this year, Tuberville said in an interview that he would allow President Donald Trump latitude for his actions he wants to take against metropolitan areas that attract immigrants.
“‘President Trump can do anything he wants when it comes to the federal,” he said in an interview in June. “Again, these inner-city rats, they live off the federal government. And that’s one reason we’re $37 trillion in debt.’”
About two weeks earlier at a Montgomery Area Chamber of Commerce event, Tuberville said he had received notice from Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, that additional FBI agents would be deployed to Montgomery.
“They will not be noticeable,” he said in an interview with the media following his speech. “There will be more investigative people, people coming in and backing up local law enforcement. They have done that in several cities; it is nothing new.”
Alabama has some of the nation’s highest mortality rates from firearms. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 1,300 people died from gunfire in 2023, a rate of 25.6 per 100,000 that was the fourth-highest in the nation. The total number of gun deaths in Alabama was higher than in New York State, which has four times Alabama’s population.
Cities such as Montgomery, along with Birmingham and others, continue to deal with persistent crime, particularly with incidents that involve firearms. Democrats point to some of the laws enacted by the Legislature that made the state more vulnerable to gun violence.
In 2022, lawmakers repealed a law requiring Alabamians to purchase permits to carry a concealed weapon. Law enforcement said it endangered and have since lost a key source of revenue used for training and to buy equipment.
Republican lawmakers said they passed the legislation because residents should not have to pay for their constitutional right to carry a firearm.
“When you stop politicizing an issue, you can start to focus on what the major problem is, and if you talk to most law enforcement who are responsible for patrolling our streets, they will you the streets got much less safer once we passed permit less-carry because it became very difficult to differentiate who can legally carry and who can’t,” said Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, said in an interview on Monday.
In the spring, Republicans in the statehouse passed a series of measures that eliminated bail and enhanced penalties for people who were allegedly involved in crimes that involve firearms. Most Democrats opposed the proposals but for one that made it a state law to convert a semi-automatic pistol into a fully automatic weapon.
“If making more crimes and incarcerating people is the answer to the crime problem, then we should be the safest place in America, in the world,” England said. “The bottom line is, the same old approaches are producing the same, old results.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0255-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-06 08:17:08.918036

Councilor Ed Flynn, who represents a section of the city that includes the vulnerable Seaport district along with other coastal parts of the South End, introduced the nonbinding resolution to push for financial relief for homeowners, renters, and businesses with flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program.  
CommonWealth Beacon reported last week that Boston missed a 2021 self-imposed deadline to join FEMA’s Community Rating System program, which rewards flood insurance policyholders with discounts on their premiums in communities that are taking proactive steps to minimize flood risk above and beyond minimum national standards.  
The result since the city missed that goal four years ago: The 5,770 Boston residents and businesses insured through the NFIP have paid at least $785,000 in total unnecessary flood insurance costs, according to state data analyzed by CommonWealth Beacon.  
It’s a substantial financial blow amid high costs of living statewide exacerbated by the increasing precipitation and sea level rise caused by climate change. As more catastrophic storms occur, more Massachusetts residents are purchasing flood insurance.   
Chris Osgood, director of Boston’s office of climate resilience, previously told CommonWealth Beacon that the city has not yet joined the program because of the administrative burdens associated with applying, a perceived barrier shared by several other municipalities and floodplain management experts. Joining the Community Rating System requires robust documentation of construction certificates of buildings in the floodplain and developing a plan to address “repetitive loss” properties.  
Flynn said in a statement that he heard “serious concerns” from his constituents about the city’s failure to apply to FEMA’s Community Rating System program and how that “inaction has left residents prone to higher flood insurance premiums.”  
“It was critical that City Council spoke in one voice today – to say that Boston needs to make this a top priority, and potentially save millions of dollars for policyholders,” he said. “A difficult application process is no excuse for us to delay certification any longer, especially with rising costs for those living in the flood map.” 
Boston isn’t alone. Just 22 municipalities in Massachusetts are enrolled in CRS and receiving flood insurance discounts. Nationwide, only 1,700 communities have joined the program out of 22,600 municipalities that could participate. Coastal cities in New England like Portland, Maine, and New Haven, Connecticut, are participating in CRS.

(Photo: Getty Images)Moapa residents opposing a planned mine and cement manufacturing facility in the area were handed a win Tuesday after the Clark County Planning Commission unanimously voted to deny a plan to rezone hundreds of acres of residential and agricultural land to industrial use.
The Moapa Valley quarry and cement plant project, proposed by Utah-based Bridgesource, would cover nearly 2,200 acres of private and public land east of the unincorporated town of Moapa located about 50 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
Bridgesource is seeking to rezone about 380 acres of recently acquired private land from agricultural and residential use to heavy industrial use. The zoning change would clear the way for a cement plant to be built within four miles of roughly 500 homes, two elementary schools, and two community parks and recreation facilities in Moapa. 
The company is also looking to build a limestone mine on about 200 acres of public land near Moapa in order to supply the raw materials needed to produce cement at the planned facility. Bridgesource said they expect the limestone deposit at the site to provide enough material to last up to 80 years. 
All seven members of the Clark County Planning Commission voted to deny Bridgesource’s application to make changes to the county’s Comprehensive Master Plan that would redesignate the area for industrial purposes.

While the vote was a welcome development for residents of Moapa who oppose the project, it’s not the end for the project. 
The Board of Clark County Commissioners – who also serve as the Zoning Commission – could overrule the Planning Commission’s vote when they meet on December 3rd.
Merrill Squire, the director of project development for Bridgesource,  also said the company was open to building the cement plant on public land, which would not require a zoning change.
The Clark County Planning Commission vote came after more than two hours of testimony from Moapa residents who overwhelmingly opposed the project, citing fears of air pollution, noise, and the facility’s proximity to residential neighborhoods. 
During public comments, Moapa residents argued the land use amendments and rezoning changes to the county’s Master Plan sought by Bridgesource were inconsistent with the plan’s goals and standards.
“This is probably the largest and most organized objection to an application that I’ve seen,” said Clark County Planning Commissioner Michael Roitman.
Moapa residents said they feared potential adverse health effects from dust and other air pollutants that would be generated from both the mine and the cement plant. Residents argued the project would degrade the community and natural environment by building a massive industrial project in the midst of their rural agricultural community.
Residents also raised concerns about the impact the mine and cement plant would have on water in the area. The project would be adjacent to the Muddy River, often considered the lifeblood of Moapa Valley and a Nevada tributary to the Colorado River.
During public comments, the Sierra Club highlighted the project’s potential negative impacts on endangered species like the desert tortoise and the Virgin River chub, urging a delay in zoning changes until a full environmental impact assessment is completed under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
Since the proposed limestone mine would be on public land it will need to undergo a strict environmental review process under NEPA.
“I am moved by the concern for the heritage and the environment,” Roitman said. “I’m also skeptical that folks want to build a community around a cement plant and a mine.”
Squire, the director of project development for Bridgesource, argued the cement plant and limestone mine would create economic development for the rural community. The plant is expected to employ 150-200 full-time workers and generate $10 million in tax revenue annually for the first 10 years, said Squire.
Clark County Planning Commissioners said while they don’t oppose mining or industrial development in the Moapa Valley, they questioned the location of the project.
Squire said the company chose the location because it has large quantities of chemical-grade limestone the company has mining rights to, and easy access to a major highway and rail infrastructure.
“Every good job is important, but I don’t think that 100 jobs, or 150 jobs, would outweigh the opposition that I’ve seen here tonight,” Roitman said. “This seems kind of like a raw deal for them, even though it may be a good deal for the applicant.”
The Moapa Band of Paiutes also expressed concerns about the lack of an environmental review and tribal consultation for the project. Ivan Reel, the chairman of Moapa Band of Paiutes, asked the Clark County Planning Commission to deny Bridgesource’s application after the company failed to consult the tribe. 
Squire said the company reached out to more than a dozen tribes in the area, four of which helped advise a cultural survey of the area.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2155895591-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-06 07:56:23.761921

The ordinance, proposed by Mayor Shelley Berkley and Councilwoman Nancy Brune, prohibits the sale of dogs, cats, rabbits, pot belly pigs, and guinea pigs. 
“Pet stores have a well-documented track record of mistreating animals and selling unhealthy pets to unsuspecting customers,” Nevada Treasurer Zach Conine wrote to the council. “Additionally, animal shelters face an overcrowding crisis and are at risk of euthanizing animals for space.”
Nevada Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Executive Director Lori Heeren, a privately funded no-kill shelter, told the Council that on Tuesday, the organization had to stop accepting dogs for lack of space. 
The NSPCA website, she said, has “lots of breeds, including purebred dogs and puppies. We literally have people turn puppies into our shelters with their receipts, including receipts from Pet Land, because the puppy has grown up,” and the owner lacks the resources to care for it.  
 Chris Giunchigliani, who formerly served in the state Legislature and on the Clark County Commission, reminded the council that its predecessors passed a ban on pet sales, only to rescind it a year later. 
“All of the jurisdictions have increased animals coming into shelters and rescues from illegal breeders, causing taxpayers and animal rights people to bear the burden of paying for the inaction,” she said, adding that illegal puppy mills are operating in Nye and Elko counties. “You could liken it to human trafficking, only it’s with animals.”
Giunchigliani suggested that in the next three years, the city obtain addresses of local breeders that provide animals to pet stores. 
“I’m a second generation small business owner, and I don’t feel comfortable, and I don’t think it’s the proper role of government to unilaterally take business licenses away,” said Councilwoman Francis Allen Palenske, one of two council members to vote against the measure. 
The other member to vote against the measure, Councilman Brian Knudsen, suggested the proposed regulation “would probably put several of the businesses in my ward out of business.”  He argued existing pet stores should be permanently allowed to sell pets. “I haven’t taken money from anybody. I asked my veterinarian what I should do.” 
Knudsen did not respond when asked to identify his veterinarian. 
A proposed state law to ban the sale of pets died in the Nevada Legislature this year. The lobbyist representing the pet stores that opposed the ban was Alisa Nave, whose family business owns more than a dozen veterinary practices in Southern Nevada.
Berkley, who was praised by her colleagues for gaining majority support on a contentious issue, apologized for not achieving a unanimous vote. 
“I kind of feel I let everybody down by not working harder to make this more palatable for every member of the city council,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/beagle-in-research-lab.png.avif,,,2025-11-06 07:56:23.761921

(Anne-Marie Caruso | New Jersey Monitor)Hudson County’s GOP leader said it was on Saturday when he started to believe Republicans might lose the governor’s race.
That was the first of November, the day people normally would have started receiving their monthly food stamp benefits — benefits cut off by the ongoing federal government shutdown. Jose Arango, the Hudson County Republican Party chairman, said he grew worried then that voters who helped propel Donald Trump to the White House again last year wouldn’t be as energized to vote for the GOP this time around.
“I started feeling a twist on the community, the Spanish community. And when I saw that, we couldn’t stop it — the car had already left the station, we were where we were, and it was something we couldn’t control,” he said. “The Republican Party in New Jersey couldn’t control what was going on in Washington.”
Republicans grappling with the dismal results of their party in Tuesday’s gubernatorial election told the New Jersey Monitor that the outcome says less about Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli than it does about the national political climate. Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman, was handily defeated by Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D), 56% to 43%.
“We were outplayed,” said Sen. Mike Testa (R-Cumberland).
A referendum on Trump
The ongoing federal government shutdown, the longest in the nation’s history, hung heavily over the race in the last month, as did other actions by the Trump administration.

Ciattarelli, who maintained some distance from the president in past bids, broadly refused to criticize Trump as he ran for governor for a third time. During a debate with Sherill, Ciattarelli was asked to grade Trump and gave him an “A.” Democrats seized on that moment.
Sen. Vince Polistina (R-Atlantic) noted his county is home to a federal military base, and families impacted by the shutdown are anxious about the economy. He said New Jersey’s rejection of Ciattarelli was not only a referendum on Republicans, but a message to federal leaders not to create hardships for people, “from a health care perspective or food insecurity.”
“Clearly, the electorate spoke and blamed Republicans, and we took a beating for it,” he said.
Some Republicans were blunter in their analysis.
“This was a referendum on Donald Trump and the reaction in New Jersey, a blue state, to Donald Trump, and since Jack was 100% MAGA, he was part of the referendum on Trump,” said Sen. Jon Bramnick (R-Union), a moderate and frequent Trump critic who was among Ciattarelli’s rivals for the GOP gubernatorial nod. “Things aren’t very complicated in politics sometimes.”
Assemblyman Brian Bergen (R-Morris), a conservative member of the lower chamber, said it appears voters this year cared more about what Trump is doing than what’s happening in New Jersey. He cited Trump’s push to demolish the east wing of the White House to build a ballroom and the president pulling funding for the Gateway project, which Bergen said happened at “the most untimely time for our election.”
“I’m getting the sense from everybody that, more or less, it’s directly connected to that type of stuff,” Bergen said. “And it has very little to do with anything happening in New Jersey, to be honest, and that sucks.”
Ciattarelli should have praised Trump where their platforms overlapped and split on policy where he disagreed, said Bramnick. Not doing so risked straining voters’ credulity or alienating them altogether.
Bramnick noted that during a GOP gubernatorial debate earlier this year, his opponents competed to be the candidate who loves Trump the most.
“I sat there while everybody was saying that they couldn’t find anything that they disagree with the president. I said, ‘Look, nobody believes that,’” Bramnick said. “People want authenticity. Authenticity is sometimes you disagree.”

Testa disagrees that Trump shoulders the blame for Tuesday’s results. After endorsing Trump in the GOP primary, Trump did not appear in New Jersey for any general election campaign events, Testa noted. But Democrats had a better message about the government shutdown than Republicans, he added.
Republicans have sought to reopen the federal government without addressing a spike in health care costs caused by the lapse of federal subsidies for plans purchased on the individual marketplace. Democrats have argued that any budget measure that would end the shutdown should include those subsidies.
The lapse in federal funding for food stamps, in particular, hurt Republicans, according to Testa. Trump has said he won’t tap into an emergency fund to pay out food stamp benefits until the shutdown ends.
“Nobody wants to hear about children potentially going hungry without food, without proper nutrition,” Testa said.
Testa blames GOP consultants on the Ciattarelli campaign for missing a swell of anti-Trump voters coming to the polls, saying bad data enabled ineffective messaging.
“The Republican consultant class in the state of New Jersey, particularly those who were working on this campaign, should never be hired again in the state of New Jersey,” he said.
Moving on
Ciattarelli’s loss was not the only bad news for the GOP on Tuesday. Sherrill’s win helped flip a handful of Assembly seats now held by Republicans, giving Democrats an even firmer grasp on the 80-seat body come January.
Sen. Doug Steinhardt, Warren County’s Republican chairman and a former state GOP chair, said the party failed to energize GOP voters who rarely turn out to vote, including in the 23rd Legislative District, which Steinhardt represents. The district is a conservative area in the northwestern part of the state.
Democrats have not won a legislative race in the 23rd since the 1970s, and though results there were not especially close Tuesday, Republicans’ margin of victory was less than half of what it was in almost every race since at least 2009.

“Speaking for my own county — and I was critical of it last night and again this morning — we didn’t do as good a job as our Democratic counterparts making sure our low-propensity voters were getting to the polls,” he said.
Testa said New Jersey Republicans need to unite around a better message, but it’s too early to say what that message is. Bergen said his party needs to improve on protecting itself from “external factors.”
“We need to build a strong foundation within our party where we’re trusted and people will err on the side of going with us even if crazy sh*t’s happening in the world,” he said.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Secretary Julie Moore and Commissioner Kerrick Johnson: Vermont’s housing needs require decisive action, so step up or step away.","This commentary is by Julie Moore, secretary of the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, and Kerrick Johnson, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Service.


Vermont faces a housing crisis that threatens our economic future and the ability of working families to remain in our state. The cost of housing has skyrocketed with median home prices in Vermont more than doubling in the last 10 years, putting both homeownership and rentals out of reach for many. Vermont needs 30,000 new homes by 2030, requiring 8,000 units per year for the next four years. At current rates, we’ll struggle to hit even 25% of that goal.
In response, Gov. Phil Scott recently issued a housing executive order that directs a set of measured yet impactful steps to accelerate housing development timelines and reduce costs.
The governor’s executive order doesn’t eliminate regulatory review or ignore legitimate concerns. It balances the need for affordability with environmental objectives for housing projects in areas identified for development. These are modest, commonsense reforms designed to provide regulatory certainty, moving projects more quickly from planning to construction while maintaining needed protections.

Sadly, if predictably, a number of environmental interest groups and other groups have responded with reflexive opposition.
In voicing their opposition to the executive order, environmental advocacy groups have offered no actionable alternatives. They haven’t proposed how to accelerate permitting while maintaining protections. They haven’t suggested which regulations could be modernized or consolidated. They haven’t identified specific areas where housing could be fast-tracked. Instead, they’ve defaulted to criticism without contribution — the easiest position to maintain and the least helpful for Vermonters struggling to find housing.
This matters because housing isn’t an abstract policy debate. These are real problems affecting our neighborhoods, communities, businesses and schools. It’s about whether a teacher can afford to live in the community where they work. It’s about whether a young couple can start a family here instead of moving to New Hampshire or North Carolina. It’s about whether businesses, from the smallest engineering firm to the general store to our beloved universities are able to thrive right here in Vermont.
Without housing, we cannot recruit and retain staff for our nursing homes, clinics and hospitals as there simply aren’t places for them to live.
Yet in the face of the governor’s modest but concrete measures that should reduce the cost and speed the timeline for constructing homes, these interest groups retreat to familiar talking points and procedural objections. Their response reveals an uncomfortable truth: their real interests lie in preserving the existing regulatory barriers rather than meaningful problem-solving.
This dynamic exemplifies what Ezra Klein, an award-winning columnist with the New York Times, explored in his recent work on abundance: our regulatory systems have become so byzantine, so weighted toward one-off objections and appeals rather than progress, that we actively obstruct the very things we claim to want most.
We say we need affordable housing, then create endless opportunities for delay. We claim we want walkable downtowns and community schools filled with children, and then make land-use policies that limit density and put homeownership out of reach for young families. We declare climate emergencies, then enact policies without regard for the cost of implementation. We bemoan economic stagnation, then strangle development with process.
Within the broader environmental community there is clear expertise and legitimate perspectives. But expertise wielded not to provide constructive input and alternatives but to instead assert picayune process objections is mere obstruction.
Vermont needs an abundance agenda — one that recognizes we can protect our environment while building the housing our communities desperately need. We can say yes to appropriate development while conserving what makes Vermont special. But this requires solving problems rather than simply scoring political points.
To the environmental groups criticizing this executive order: please show us your plan. Tell us how you would accelerate housing production. Identify specific regulatory reforms you support. If you cannot or will not, then most Vermonters will understand your opposition for what it really is — political theater performed at the expense of working families searching for places to live and businesses struggling to bring new hires to the state.
Gov. Scott has taken action. We stand ready to implement solutions. The question now is whether environmental interest groups who claim to care about Vermont’s future will contribute to solving this crisis or perpetuate the status quo.

(Courtesy U.S. Forest Service)An analysis of U.S. Forest Service data by a wildland firefighter advocacy group shows that wildfire mitigation efforts in New Mexico— including prescribed burns and other hazardous fuel treatments—are down by 53% since President Donald Trump took office in January.
When compared to yearly averages over the Biden Administration, the data shows that the U.S. Forest Service is significantly behind on wildfire mitigation in the country’s national forests.
In 2023, for example, the federal government treated just under 203,000 acres of forest for flammable fuels ranging from dead trees and dried up brush to grasses and twigs in New Mexico alone. In 2025, that number dropped to just over 68,000.
“The reason we want to thin and prescribe burn and do the pile burning is because we want a healthy forest, and we want to keep it safe so we don’t lose so when there’s a fire, we don’t lose the entire forest,” said Bobbie Scopa, executive secretary of the advocacy group Grassroots Wildland Firefighters. Scopa also spent 45 years as a firefighter.
Overall, the advocacy group’s data analysis found that the crucial hazardous fuels reduction work done by the Forest Service was down 38% in 2025 compared with the same period over the previous four calendar years.
A crucial part of forest ecosystems, land managers use hazardous fuels reduction such as thinning and controlled burns to curb the severity and intensity of future forest fires that could spread to nearby communities.
In a letter to Democratic U.S. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon last month, U.S Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz blamed “operational challenges” for the lack of prescribed burn work, in addition to ongoing wildfires in both Canada and the U.S. as a drain on otherwise available resources.




Scopa told KUNM that there are other reasons for the dip – including the Trump administration’s aggressive downsizing of executive agencies in tandem with severe budget cuts and the ongoing government shutdown, which is now the longest in U.S. history.
That makes it highly unlikely that the Forest Service will make up this gap before the end of the year.
“It’s like a chess game, trying to manage to get the work done,” Scopa said.
However, Scopa notes that the current fuels work snafu is adding to an already existing 80 million-acre backlog of forest management projects, compounding a large problem with an increasingly diminishing workforce.
“They’re killing themselves. Literally,” Scopa said. “People are ending up in the hospital, not only from the smoke and ruining their joints from carrying weight up and down mountains, but dying from mental health issues because the pace of the work is unhealthy and unsustainable.”
The past few years have been an uphill battle for federal wildland firefighters, who only just recently won a yearslong fight for a permanent pay raise amid rampant issues with agency staffing, low morale, and non-existent protective equipment.
Additionally, these findings come as weather officials predict New Mexico might suffer from a drier and warmer winter as a consequence of the ongoing “weak” La Niña weather pattern, potentially extending this year’s fire season.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/fire-controlled-burns-u.s-forest-service.jpg,,,2025-11-06 07:20:34.607796

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Nuclear energy leaders from across the country and world converged on West Lafayette Wednesday to reenergize an industry they hope will meet booming energy needs.
“Now’s the time. Indiana is the place,” said Indiana Energy and Natural Resources Secretary Suzanne Jaworowski. The state is “ready, and willing, and able to deploy nuclear.”
She spoke on the first of a two-day Global Nuclear Energy Economic Summit at Purdue University’s Loeb Playhouse, which was the launchpad for a flurry of announcements.
There, AES Indiana President Brandi Davis-Handy announced the company — one of the state’s “big five” investor-owned electric utilities — would study the feasibility of building small modular reactors at its Eagle Valley and Petersburg power plants.

The analysis will look at licensing, construction and operations, she said, plus siting factors like how the population is distributed, whether there’s water nearby for cooling, if transmission infrastructure can handle the power generated and emergency planning considerations.
The study will “guide the selection of the most suitable site and provide a clear growth path for future progress,” Davis-Handy said. It’s expected to be done by mid-2026.
Nuclear isn’t part of AES Indiana’s “current preferred portfolio,” spokeswoman Mallory Duncan said in a statement to the Capital Chronicle, but “we remain open to considering it in the future if it becomes more economically viable and aligns with the best interests of our customers.”
First American Nuclear staff also flocked to the stage to celebrate Tuesday’s announcement that the company will site its headquarters, manufacturing facilities and a specialized energy park in Indiana. That park will be the first in the country to operate in “closed-fuel cycle,” meaning that spent nuclear fuel will be reprocessed and reused, according to FANCO.
Purdue also launched a new Institute for Energy Innovation and announced the nation’s first online credential program in small modular reactors. University President Mung Chiang further celebrated a research and development agreement with nuclear manufacturer BWX Technologies.

Chiang later joined Indiana Gov. Mike Braun to headline the summit with a “fireside” chat.
“I feel confident that, if we play our cards right, Indiana will be … first on SMRs, on having data centers without burdening the average taxpayer,” Braun said.
Nuclear development takes years to come to fruition.
A Boston University study found that runaway construction costs and delayed timelines stymie many energy projects.
Nuclear power plants are the worst offenders, with an average construction cost overrun typically twice as much as expected, and the most extreme time delays. To be exact, the average nuclear power plant has a construction cost overrun of 102.5% and ends up costing $1.56 billion more than expected.
Supply chain woes
Panelists repeatedly lauded Indiana’s approach to nuclear.
“It’s going to take a village to do what we’re talking about, and the village in Indiana is strong,” said Brendon Baatz, who works on energy market development at Google. 
He cited “strong state leadership,” supportive utility companies and a pipeline of nuclear engineers coming out of Purdue’s program.
A stunted supply chain could be among the industry’s greatest challenges.
“If there’s going to be a big problem with a project in the future, it’s going to be because of a failure in the supply chain,” said William Magwood IV, the director-general of the Nuclear Energy Agency. 
One supplier missing a deadline could cause a chain reaction, he said, and “that’s when we have these big overruns, and that’s when we cancel projects.”
For Theodore Garrish, the assistant secretary for nuclear energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, a nuclear reactor fuel crunch was top of mind.

He highlighted an ongoing shortage of high-assay low-enriched uranium. It’s set to worsen, as a ban on Russian uranium imports takes full effect in 2028.
“We have really relied, up to 25% in our country’s (uranium) enrichment, on the Russians. When this happens, we are going to have a huge gap that we’ve got to meet,” Garrish said. The federal government will soon award $2.7 billion to develop domestic production, he added.
Getting parts in on time is a “tightrope dance,” said Stephen McKinney, vice president for U.S. commercial operations at Westinghouse. The company is working with Google on an artificial intelligence-powered project to optimize when equipment is needed.
“If you’re waiting on a certain component to arrive at the site, you could have a large amount of labor sitting there,” he said, driving expenses higher.
Eric Williams, the executive vice president and chief operations officer at TerraPower, called for the country to bring back heavy manufacturing from overseas — and develop the American workforce’s skills and knowledge.

The months-long wait on equipment from Asia or Europe “does not fit into a tight schedule,” he said.
Speakers indicated the industry’s pause four decades ago — after the 1979 meltdown at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania and the 1986 explosion at Chernobyl nuclear plant in what’s now Ukraine — has limited American expertise.
Julie Bentz, a nuclear policy and safety adviser to FANCO, recalled graduating from college at a time when about 60 universities had affiliated research reactors. That dropped by half when she returned to university a decade later for graduate-level work.
“You have an unusual 20-year gap in this profession, and when we look at supply chain, that’s going to have an impact across every single component,” she said. Experts, for example, are typically either aged 60 and older or 40 and younger.

(Photo by Glen Stubbe/Minnesota Reformer)After growing up in foster care, Mary Davis extricated herself and her son from domestic abuse in Chicago and landed in a Minneapolis homeless shelter in 2011 — then quickly found stable housing and enrolled in support programs to receive a stable income and health care. 
“I had to grow up really quick…so that’s always been the way I looked at things — like, no one is going to care as deep as I care about what’s going on in my situation, so I have to get out there and get it,” Davis said. 
But the expiration of funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps Davis buy groceries for herself and her 15-year-old son, is testing the resiliency that helped Davis go from the shelter to stability. 
Davis gets $456 on an electronic benefits transfer card every month on the 10th, she said, and supplements the food she purchases through SNAP with trips to food shelves. Her only income is from Social Security — around $1,100 per month — because she is disabled; blind in one eye from domestic violence and diagnosed with several chronic health conditions. 
Davis’ son is on human growth hormones, so she’s trying to feed him plenty of nutritious food. SNAP helps her buy foods at the grocery store that are harder to come by at food shelves, like meat and produce.

The federal government shutdown means SNAP funding has run out. Democratic-led states and advocates have sued the Trump administration to pay out the benefits during the shutdown using emergency funds, and as part of the lawsuits the administration agreed to pay out partial benefits. 
But it’s not clear when the money will get to recipients — Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has said it could take “several weeks” to execute partial payments; the state Department of Children, Youth and Families said Tuesday it does not have a timeline. 
Around 440,000 Minnesotans rely on SNAP; 152,000 children are children, 72,000 are seniors and 52,000 are adults with disabilities. Nearly half of recipients live outside of the Twin Cities.
Davis doesn’t know when she’ll receive her next round of grocery money. Until then, she said, she’ll be looking for free food wherever she can get it — and is considering taking out loans or using risky “buy now, pay later” services to make ends meet. 
And she’ll pray about it. 
“Really that’s the only other option I have,” Davis said.

Food shelves already feeling the pressure
At the Neighborhood House food shelf on Montreal Ave. in St. Paul on Tuesday morning, families loaded carts with food and household items. It was much busier than usual.
For the first time since it opened in June of 2024, volunteers turned families away. There wasn’t enough food for everyone. 
“We have been anticipating this,” said Janet Gracia, president and CEO of Neighborhood House.
Demand at food shelves had already risen in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic, thanks to food inflation. Neighborhood House opened up the Montreal Avenue food market — its second location — and doubled the food budget over the year and a half it’s been open. 
That was all before the government shutdown and impact on SNAP.

The majority of the people served by Neighborhood House rely on SNAP benefits and have been using the food shelf to supplement their shopping, Gracia said. By early November, some Minnesotans were already missing their November credit; those who get their benefits later in the month may have already run out of their October credit.
Neighborhood House is expanding its hours and making emergency food bags available more frequently to its clients who need help.
“The people that you are seeing in our food markets right now…they already have empty shelves and empty pantries in their home,” Gracia said.
Moo Ehpaw is a 28-year-old mother of three who relies on SNAP and food shelves to feed her family. Her husband works at a turkey processing plant, and she stays home with their two-year-old.
She’ll be increasing her efforts to find free food when the benefits run out. 
“I think a lot of other people, they worry too…they are aware of the cuts that are happening,” Ehpaw said in Karen through an interpreter.
Language barriers can be an impediment to immigrants who are searching for food resources, said Mu Lweh, a St. Paul resident who also speaks Karen.

A nightmare for the state
A court order requiring the Trump administration to use emergency funds to pay out partial SNAP benefits isn’t likely to alleviate recipients’ hunger any time soon. 
Guidance sent to Minnesota and other states from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Tuesday outlines how states must implement the reduced benefits.
Recipients will receive a maximum of half their usual monthly benefits, but some new applicants may have 30% of their net household income deducted from their (already-reduced) credit amount, according to the guidance.
“It requires a complete recalculation and a complete recoding of our system,” said Tikki Brown, commissioner of the Department of Children, Youth and Families during a media briefing Tuesday.
DCYF employees are running through “a variety of solutions,” but the department doesn’t yet know when it will distribute the reduced benefits. 
“Initially we were hoping for the least burdensome, cleanest way for us to issue benefits, and unfortunately, the information that we received today is a really highly complex calculation,” Brown said.
(Complicating the situation: President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social after the USDA issued its guidance that SNAP benefits “will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government.”)

Democrats are refusing to vote for Republican-authored spending bills that would reopen the government unless the GOP includes extensions of subsidies that lower the cost of health insurance plans purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. 
Davis, the single mom, blames Republicans for the SNAP predicament and shutdown. 
“I definitely get why [Democrats] are holding back. Like, it all goes together — if your health is not in order, none of it works,” Davis said.
This government shutdown is now the longest in history. There is still no end in sight.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/14-SNAP-1125-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-06 07:20:34.607796

“I didn’t know these people,” she said of festival performers that also included a klezmer band and Hawaiian falsetto singers, “but I’ll never forget them.”
Mayo, local manager for the 82nd National Folk Festival, wants fellow Jacksonians and capital city tourists to grab and take away the same thrill, surprise and bliss when the free, three-day festival takes over downtown Jackson Friday through Sunday. 
The National Council for the Traditional Arts partners with host communities, in this case the city of Jackson, to produce the National Folk Festival around the country, and this is the first one in the Deep South. 
“It’s like the festival is coming home,” council Executive Director Blaine Waide said, noting Mississippi artists’ frequent presence at different festivals it produces, and the state’s impact on American music and musical history. “It’s a really appropriate place to have the festival.”
Jackson remains the host city for the 83rd and 84th National Folk Festivals in 2026 and 2027, laying the groundwork for a locally produced festival after the three-year National Council for the Traditional Arts   residency ends. Ergon/Alliant is the presenting sponsor of the 82nd National Folk Festival.

Mississippi artists hold a vibrant role at this year’s festival as well, Those on the roster include Jackson blues icon Bobby Rush, Bentonia bluesman Jimmy “Duck” Holmes, Greenville blues musician Keith Johnson, Clarksdale’s James “Super Chikan” Johnson, Bay Springs Southern soul artist Ms. Jody, singer/guitarist Vasti Jackson of Hattiesburg and even the Sonic Boom of the South.
“At our event, we’ll have, obviously, what’s near and dear to us, which is the blues and gospel,” Mayo said, “and you’ll hear some new things like go-go music out of D.C., you’ll hear Irish fiddling, you’ll hear so many different types of music presented from world-class musicians.”
The National Folk Festival celebrates traditional arts — the music, dance and crafts of many different communities and cultures that may have roots in farflung places, but call America home. The knowledge, skill and artistic expression are passed down informally, through families and in community. 
“They’re key to identity,” Waide said. “When people think about, ‘Who am I? What defines me?’ it’s often those traditional expressions that have been passed down across generations.
“Folk and traditional arts isn’t just banjo and fiddle music,” he said. It is that, but it encompasses much more. The tremendous sweep of cultural expression enlivening the festival in Jackson also includes zydeco, salsa dura, South Asian qawwali (sung poetry, a meditative form of Islam), cowboy and western, trío romántico, Korean pungmul, flamenco, Cabo Verdean (blend of African and Portuguese influences, familiar in New England), sacred steel gospel, klezmer, West African balafon and more.
“Absolutely amazing performers,” Waide pegged them. “People are going to come to this festival because they want to see Bobby Rush, or they’re going to come to see Ms. Jody or E.U., and they’re going to walk away, going, like, ‘Holy crap, I didn’t know Korean percussion and dance was so cool.’” Many of the artists perform multiple times over the three days.
The closest equivalent to the National Folk Festival is probably Jubilee! JAM, the large-scale, ticketed music festival with a family-friendly, all-ages appeal in downtown Jackson that took place from the late 1980s through early 2000s. Notable differences: the National Folk Festival is free, and it has no “headliners,” or at least performers touted as such.
“The festival is the star,” Waide said, emphasizing that the event’s rich and varied cultures and sheer range of artistic expression constitute its primary draw. “It’s not about elevating any one artist over other artists. There are no headliners, there’s no main stage. It’s about experiencing the whole thing.
“The message is that these folks are all around us, that this level of artistry and creativity across different cultural communities is there in America and it’s a chance to celebrate and honor that.”
The festival presents a chance to riff on that, too, as artists come together and creative sparks fly. Mayo recalled the magical synergy that bubbled up among a zydeco singer, blues band and Beat Ya Feet dancers at one festival, “And, it was one of the wildest things that I’ve ever experienced!” she said with a happy laugh. “You’ll never see that again.”
The National Folk Festival is free to make it accessible and set in downtown Jackson to make it centrally located.
“There’s the symbolic idea of the public square, and welcoming everybody in that space and offering a program that is as representative as possible so that everybody there feels that it belongs to them,” Waide said. 
The pedestrian-only festival site stretches from State Street to Farish Street, and Pascagoula Street to Yazoo Street, with six outdoor stages and a dance pavilion. Concrete barriers will prevent vehicular traffic on the site. Performers take to the streets, too, with Capitol at Congress a prime spot to catch them offstage, including krump dancing from Leaving Legacies in Jackson or New Orleans Black masking craftsman and stilt dancer Chief Shaka Zulu.

Parking options, free and paid, are available at downtown public parking decks and garages outside the festival site. Free festival parking is available at the southwest corner of the State Fairgrounds with a shuttle or walk to the festival site, as well as a free park-and-ride shuttle service from Smith-Wills Stadium.
Food and drink (soft drinks, lemonade, water, beer, seltzers, canned wine) will be for sale at the festival. Food selections, too, reflect a range of cultures, including Jamaican, Southern, barbecue, Mediterranean, Mexican, Colombian, fair food and more, with strong representation from local eateries (including Hen and Egg, Campbell’s Bakery, Hal & Mal’s, Green Ghost Tacos and Lee’s Heavenly BBQ & Soul Food).
A Festival Marketplace highlights traditional and contemporary handmade creations from state and regional artists and craftspeople, including quilts, pottery, jewelry, woodwork and more.
“One of the best parts about the festival is that it’s going to bring everyone together around the arts,” Mississippi Arts Commission Executive Director David Lewis said.
The festival welcomes cultural communities from across the nation to Jackson, plus showcases many right here in Mississippi, particularly in the City with Soul Mississippi Folklife Area and stage on the Old Capitol Green. This year’s “Legacies of Empowerment” theme ties into the centennial of the births of blues legend B.B. King and civil rights champion Medgar Evers. In addition to blues and gospel, hear hip hop, punk and Mexican huapango music, enjoy Choctaw social dancing and see demonstrations of pine needle and Choctaw basketry, and Super Chikan’s guitar-making skills.

“Visitors have an opportunity not only to learn from the artists, but also participate actively in creating something communally as part of the festival,” Kristen Brandt, the folk and traditional arts director at the Mississippi Arts Commission, said. Zinesters lead visitors in creating their own mini-magazines, for example.
The folklife focus also wraps in groups bound by community and culture that may surprise some to find at the arts-heavy festival, such as skateboarders with Skate Jackson, the Motor Mouse Motorcycle Club from Indianola and a fourth generation farming family from Sledge.
The “Legacies of Empowerment” theme echoes, too, in the Family Area in Smith Park, where children can make their own personalized little Lucilles in a nod to King’s famous guitar, and make-and-take buttons reminiscent of the civil rights movement. Traditional Choctaw games and crafts, animal ambassadors from the Mississippi Museum of Natural Science, family crest or flag making and storytelling, and Mississippi State University’s cyber-education team’s STEM trailer all entice engagement from the younger set. Performers such as the Acme Miniature Flea Circus, Leaving Legacies krump dancers and Vasti Jackson with his Soul of Jimmie Rodgers program keep steady entertainment on the park’s stage.
The National Folk Festival’s join-in fun hits its peak at the Welcome to Jackson Dance Pavilion where Pearl and State streets meet, music rules and feet move to klezmer and country western, go-go and zydeco and plenty more.
“That’s going to be the hot spot, the entire weekend,” Mayo said of the pavilion. “You can dance anywhere, but that’s where you learn and that’s where you can participate. There will always be some sort of music that will make you move your body at the dance tent.”
The event, built on partnerships, requires 800 to 1,000 volunteers for efficient operation in backstage support, beverage sales and transportation, and as artist ambassadors, members of the Bucket Brigade collecting donations to help keep the festival free, and more. 
“Really, the festival is about community engagement, civic participation and public service,” Waide said. “It takes the whole community to get behind it.” 
Mayo witnessed the strong, years-long family engagement at other festivals. 
“I talked to one daughter who started volunteering with her mom when she was 6. She’s 22 now, and that story’s not rare in the folk festival world. This is an opportunity for our families here … to build new traditions,” Mayo said.
Stakeholders see potential benefits stretching far beyond this weekend. 
“We have an opportunity to demonstrate to people what a wonderful place Jackson is. It’s not hard to find a lot of negative narratives about the city, but what gets missed is all the wonderful things that are in Jackson,” Jackson Redevelopment Authority Executive Director Christopher Pike said.
“I think it’s going to be a catalyst. You’re going to get people to come to Jackson who’ve never been to Jackson before, and they’re going to fall in love with the things that we have, that we do well here, and you might see other investments to come out of that.”

The initiative would broaden who pays to support conservation beyond just hunters, trappers and anglers. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department to pursue new ‘public access’ license amid ‘financial restructuring’.","The Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife’s workload has expanded in recent decades, and costs have risen, while a primary source of revenue — the sale of hunting, trapping and fishing licenses —  has declined.
Year after year, those trends make budgeting a difficult task. 
Now, the department is pursuing a financial restructuring and plans to push for a new license that would be required for anyone recreating on Fish and Wildlife land, according to its leaders. That new source of funding would include people like kayakers, birdwatchers and hikers, all of whom utilize wildlife management areas and boat launches.
“For the last hundred years, conservation has been paid for by hunters and trappers and anglers,” Andrea Shortsleeve, the department’s chief of operations, said in an interview last week. “Now, (we’re) trying to get everyone else who is using and benefiting from those areas to also pay in.”
Amid historic cuts to federal funding, Vermont’s budget writers are anticipating tough choices this year for departments across state government.  
But Fish and Wildlife’s challenges predate the funding cuts from President Donald Trump’s administration and don’t just involve economic headwinds. 
The Fish and Wildlife Department’s more than $31 million annual budget draws on three roughly equal sources: federal funding, the state’s General Fund and department funds. The latter includes revenue sources like motorboat registrations, timber sales and license fees — which brought in about $7 million last year. 

Over time, that balance has shifted, with licenses and timber sales making up a smaller percentage, leading the department to rely more on the General Fund, the pot of money filled by state taxes.
Despite occasional spikes, annual sales of hunting, trapping and fishing licenses have been on the decline in Vermont for decades. At the same time, lifetime licenses of different types have become increasingly popular, with one in five children born in Vermont receiving one. While that popularity raises money for the department, the funds sit in a special account and limit the number of people who pay annually. 
The worrying financial trends have forced the department to begin restructuring financially, Jason Batchelder, Fish and Wildlife commissioner, told VTDigger. With the help of consultants, the department will compare itself to its counterparts in peer states nationwide. The department is also soliciting bidders to complete a fish culture modernization study, which will recommend new efficiencies to the state’s hatchery system. 
As inflationary pressures on expenses like health care, vehicles and rent have outpaced revenues, Fish and Wildlife’s mission has changed, too. Rather than focusing solely on a handful of game species — deer, turkey and trout — the department’s mission has grown over decades to encompass the 45,000 species that inhabit Vermont and the public and private lands they call home.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fishing-access-4-20251104-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-11-06 07:20:34.607796

He is shown in a 2024 photo when he was a state senator (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).If Missouri’s newly gerrymandered congressional map makes it to the ballot next year, Republican Secretary of State Denny Hoskins wants to tell voters it “better reflects statewide voting patterns” and replaces a “gerrymandered” version that “protects incumbent politicians.”
Hoskins on Friday sent the proposed ballot language for a referendum petition to Republican Attorney General Catherine Hanaway, who must issue an opinion on the wording within 10 days. Unless it is changed, it will be challenged in court, said Richard von Glahn, director of People Not Politicians, which is seeking to put the new map on the statewide ballot next year.
“I don’t think this is going to pass the smell test on whether or not it’s accurate or unbiased or likely to create prejudice,” von Glahn said.
People Not Politicians has until Dec. 11 to submit petitions seeking a vote on the map approved in a September special legislative session. If there are enough signatures distributed among six of the state’s eight congressional districts, the map would not become effective until a statewide vote.
The language Hoskins proposed would read:
“Do the people of the state of Missouri approve the act of the General Assembly entitled ‘House Bill No. 1 (2025 Second Extraordinary Session),’ which repeals Missouri’s existing gerrymandered congressional plan that protects incumbent politicians, and replaces it with new congressional boundaries that keep more cities and counties intact, are more compact, and better reflects statewide voting patterns?”
Chiefs in, Royals out: Missouri secretary of state once again catches flak over ballot summary

If a court finds the language is insufficient or unfair, a new state law will give Hoskins three chances to revise it. If Hoskins strikes out on his three attempts, the courts can prepare a new ballot title. Earlier this year, Hoskins wrote two revisions for a constitutional amendment reinstating Missouri’s abortion ban before it was accepted by the courts. He’s also been accused of exploiting the new law to delay initiative petition campaigns.  
Statewide voting patterns in recent elections give Republicans about 60% of the vote and Democrats about 40%, von Glahn said. The new map would give Democrats 12.5% of the state delegation instead of one-quarter, he added.
“Maybe the secretary of state doesn’t understand the definition of the term gerrymandered,” he said.
Hoskins will not respond to von Glahn’s criticism due to the likely litigation, spokeswoman Rachael Dunn wrote in an email to The Independent. Hanaway’s job reviewing ballot language is “to ensure it is neither argumentative nor likely to create prejudice for or against the measure.”
At the insistence of President Donald Trump, Missouri lawmakers met over two weeks in September to redraw congressional districts so Republicans would have an advantage in elections for seven, instead of their current six, seats. The plan targeted the 5th District, held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City since 2005.
Lawsuits over the special session began before legislators started meeting and a case over the ballot title would add a new layer of litigation to the pending cases. 
There are three lawsuits — two in Jackson County and one in Cole County — asking the courts to declare lawmakers had no authority to revise district boundaries without new census data. The Cole County case is set for trial next week. 
In another case, also originating in Cole County, the Missouri NAACP asked the courts to declare that Gov. Mike Kehoe had no authority under the Missouri Constitution to call lawmakers into session for congressional redistricting and altering the majority needed to pass constitutional amendments proposed by initiative. 
Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh denied the request and the NAACP says it intends to appeal the ruling.
The referendum effort itself is the subject of two lawsuits, one in Cole County and another in federal court in St. Louis.
Arguments in the Cole County case, where People Not Politicians is suing over petitions rejected before Kehoe signed the bill, were postponed Monday due to a judge’s illness.
In the federal case, Hanaway argues that redistricting plans are not subject to referendums because the federal Constitution vests power to draw lines solely with legislatures, not the people of individual states. That case is set for trial Nov. 25 in St. Louis.
To succeed, a referendum petition must have at least 106,384 to 115,720 signatures from registered voters, depending on which six districts are used. On Wednesday, People Not Politicians said it had already exceeded 200,000 signatures.
Of that number, 92,000 are for a referendum proposal rejected by Hoskins as premature because it was submitted before Kehoe signed the redistricting bill on Sept. 28.
Gerrymandering is a word coined soon after the establishment of the U.S. Constitution to describe a district drawn to achieve a particular result. In the case of the map drawn during the special session, that result is to win a seat for the Republican Party.
Gerrymandering can also be used to prevent minority candidates from winning office or to preserve the power of political or economic interests. 
A map representative of Missouri should have five districts where Republicans are likely to win, two where Democrats have the advantage and one that is a battleground, von Glahn said.
“What you’re looking at here is dividing the largest metro area in the state into thirds and drawing them in with people 250 miles away,” he said. “It is the definition of manipulation in order to achieve an outcome.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/051724_hoskins1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-11-06 07:20:34.607796

As Missourians pack away the costumes and candy, our state’s anti-abortion politicians are still playing dress-up, hoping to trick voters into giving up the rights we fought to win just one year ago.
A year ago this week, Missourians made history. We became the first state in the nation to end a total abortion ban through a vote of the people. It was a moment many said would never come, but Missourians proved them wrong. We organized, gathered signatures and showed up at the polls. We made it clear that decisions about pregnancy should be made by individuals and families, not by politicians in Jefferson City.
That victory wasn’t a fluke. It showed who we are as a state. Missourians value freedom, fairness and honesty. We believe in minding our own business and letting others do the same. And yet, just one year later, the same politicians who ignored the will of the people are back at it again.
They’ve rewritten the ballot language for a new abortion ban planned for 2026, and they’ve done it in a way that turns the truth on its head. The new summary hides the word “ban” entirely. Instead, it’s filled with talk about “protections” and “exceptions” that don’t actually protect anyone or make abortion care available in any real way.
Let’s call it what it is: a con dressed up in a policy costume.
They know they can’t win honestly. They saw Missourians vote to legalize abortion in 2024, and they know banning it again would be deeply unpopular. So instead of facing us in the open, they’re hoping to confuse us. They’re counting on voters to skim the ballot language and assume it sounds reasonable.
But there’s nothing reasonable about trying to undo the will of 1.5 million voters. There’s nothing fair about rewriting the rules just because you lost.
Don’t forget, abortion is still legal in Missouri today. That’s because of the courage and commitment of Missourians from every corner and across the state. People who had never volunteered before stood in parking lots and farmers markets gathering signatures. Families brought their kids to the Capitol to testify. Friends and neighbors had hard conversations about personal freedom, health care, and trust.
That’s what real democracy looks like. It isn’t flashy and it doesn’t rely on scare tactics. It’s people coming together to do what’s right, even when powerful interests are working against them.
Now those same politicians are hoping we’re too distracted to notice. They’re hoping we’re tired. They’re hoping we’ve moved on. But Missourians won’t fall for the same trick twice.
Strip away the fancy language and it’s the same old ban, just wearing a new costume. And like any Halloween mask, it doesn’t hold up under the light.
As we look back on this past year, we should feel proud of what we’ve achieved together. We changed the law in our state. We reminded the nation that Missourians won’t be bullied or silenced. But we can’t stop now because the people trying to take away our rights haven’t stopped either.
We need to keep talking to our friends, neighbors and coworkers about what’s really happening. The ballot language might be written to trick us, but the truth is simple: politicians are once again trying to ban abortion in Missouri.
Halloween might be over, but the masks are still on in Jefferson City. The only way to stop the tricksters is to shine a light on what they’re doing and refuse to play along.
Missourians deserve the truth, plain and simple. We deserve the freedom to make our own decisions without interference or deception. And we deserve a state government that respects the will of its people.

Frustration simmers as officials tasked with improving alerts to crime victims continue to disagree over how the state’s automated alert system, VINE, should be managed.
The dissent began after the Department of Corrections, which pays for and manages the system, made staffing changes to its victim services unit without consulting others who interact with VINE and are tasked with changing it. 
It isn’t the first time that the Corrections Department has quietly made changes without consulting members of a task force, who were assigned by lawmakers to fix high-stakes errors in victim alerts. And when the department has made changes in the dark, advocates for victims rights have repeatedly said those changes will do more harm than good.

Crime victims in Vermont have the legal right to get timely notifications about the movements of those charged with or convicted of harming them. But conversations with lawmakers this spring illuminated that victims sometimes got incorrect alerts from VINE, which stands for Victim Information Notification Everyday. Victims can receive alerts from VINE via call, text or email. 
But sometimes VINE alerts went out to the wrong people or didn’t go out at all. In some instances, errors in the system caused victims life-altering harm. 
To address the issue, lawmakers created a task force to convene officials from throughout the justice system and survivors who used the system to make improvements to VINE. 
The task force allows employees from other departments to scrutinize VINE and give their two cents on changes. But the fact that the notification system is solely paid for and managed by the Department of Corrections has recently caused tensions. 
On Oct. 15, Jon Murad, commissioner of the Corrections Department, sent out a memo to task force officials proposing that other departments share the cost of the VINE system, which he estimates to cost the department $70,000 annually. Specifically, he sent the memo to officials from the Center for Crime Victim Services, the Department for State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs and the Department of Public Safety. 
“I am seeking feedback from your organizations on whether a cost-sharing model would
support the future sustainability of this technology and ensure all parties can exercise ownership over this critical system,” Murad wrote. 
Further down in the memo, Murad explains that part of making data improvements to its VINE system involves increasing compatibility with the state’s attorneys data system. His department “does not have additional funds or staff to perform unbudgeted IT work on behalf of other parts of state government,” he wrote. 
Murad also wrote that the department “plans to create a fulltime dedicated position to support the operations and maintenance of VINE.” That person will work on fixing errors in the system and educating department staff, he said. 
Then, during a Thursday task force meeting, Meredith Pelkey, who directs corrections victim services, said that instead of filling two vacant victim services specialist positions, the department would fill only one position. The second position would go mostly toward VINE data work. 
Meghan Place, a state’s attorney victim advocate in Windsor County, responded, asking, “We’re cutting a position?” And Pelkey said yes. 
In an interview, Place said she was “shocked” by the change. 
Place formerly worked as a victim specialist at the Corrections Department. And she thinks that having fewer victim specialists will limit options for victims, she said. Victim specialists can provide emotional support for victims, connect them with other resources and provide victims with trauma-informed communication about their offender. 
It’s concerning that a point of human contact is being taken away to work on a flawed automated system, said Jenn Poehlmann, the executive director for Crime Victim Services who chairs the task force. 
Haley Sommer, a spokesperson for the department, said the department made the change because effectively improving the VINE system involves a lot of data management and improving the data quality of the automated notifications. 
“It’s not going to take away services that we provide to victims,” Sommer said. 
VINE is a tool the department uses to meet its legal obligations to serve victims, Sommer said. Other victim specialists, along with other department employees, will be doing the work of that former victim specialist position, she said.
When asked why the Corrections Department didn’t consult with others before making the change, Sommer said it’s routine for government departments to internally repurpose positions to meet their priorities. 
“I don’t think it’s accurate to say that we’re trying to replace human engagement with more technological systems, we’re really just trying to focus on improving the system that we have,” Sommer said. 
Place agreed that VINE is a tool, but emphasized its limitations. Victims have vocally resented the fact that calls through VINE come from a cold robotic voice reading an automated message. 
The automated system lacks the “smooth touch” that real people can provide, she said. 
Tim Lueders-Dumont, executive director of the Department for State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs, said he shot down the idea that his department would share the cost of the VINE system. His department doesn’t rely on VINE to perform its legal duties and can’t afford the price tag, he said. 
Sommer said that cost-sharing the system with other departments isn’t expected to happen this budget cycle after the Corrections Department put out the “feeler” in the memo.

The bills, introduced by the committee’s Chair Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) and Sen. Ruth Johnson (R-Holly), require an appraisal if a conservator is looking to sell their ward’s home. The package also requires a court to find that it is in an individual’s best interest should their appointed guardian seek to change their residence. 
“When you have this sort of situation where someone has someone else appointed to handle their affairs and handle their personal financial details, that process is not just difficult and nuanced for everyone, but it does create opportunities for abuse,” Irwin said.

During her time as both the Michigan Secretary of State and a lawmaker, Johnson said she’d spoken to dozens of families who watched as their loved one was removed from their home without a hearing and their house was sold far below market value. 
“These families have no legal recourse. That’s because once an order is signed appointing a guardian, they have almost completely unchecked control to make these decisions,” Johnson said, noting that there are currently no minimum standards, education, certification or licensing requirements for guardians who are not related to their ward, often referred to as professional guardians. 
As such, there is not an authority where individuals can report unethical behavior, Johnson said. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Testifying before the committee in support of the bills, journalist Gretchen Rachel Hammond pointed to an investigation she’d conducted alongside a team of journalists and forensic accountants examining 2,278 cases filed before all four of Oakland County’s probate court judges, centered on four probate attorneys acting as professional guardians. 
“At the time of our investigation, the wards of whom they were given charge numbered in the hundreds per guardian,” Hammond said. “In 97% of the cases we examined within a month of being declared an incapacitated ward, an individual, or in some cases, siblings or a husband and wife, were removed from their home by the guardians.”

The investigation saw these individuals removed from their homes and placed into “subhuman and dangerous” living conditions, while their property was dispensed of without further oversight from the probate court judge, Hammond said. 
“It is a lack of oversight in Michigan and states across the country that has opened the door for professional guardians to engage in crimes that were frankly shocking, heartbreaking and occurred in plain view of a state and judge who had given them encompassing unchecked power over the lives of their victims,” Hammond said. 
While the bill received support from members of the Michigan Elder Justice Initiative, the Michigan Guardianship Association and Michigan Realtors, which advocates for real estate professionals, some attendees offered their thoughts on how the bills could be improved. 
Alison Hirschel, program director and managing attorney of the Michigan Elder Justice Initiative, asked for some additional protections within Johnson’s Senate Bill 586 to ensure individuals under guardianship are only moved from their residency when it is appropriate, and to a place that meets their needs. 
Hirschel’s proposal would require guardians seeking to move a ward to include details such as the reason for the move, efforts to keep the person in their home with added support, whether the new setting is more restrictive, the move’s impact on the person and their relationships, and whether the individual agrees with it.
Hirschel also requested language requiring the court appoint a guardian ad litem in these cases to act in the ward’s best interest, and set a hearing, alongside laying out the duties of the guardian ad litem to ensure the court makes a determination in the matter that is in the individual under guardianship’s best interests. 
Hirschel also advocated for the court to appoint counsel for a person who is opposing the move, or for whom the move may not be in their best interest. 
Additionally, she requested language laying out procedures so that a judge can determine in situations like a temporary emergency move whether that move should be permanent, while requiring the guardian to maintain their ward’s residence to the greatest extent possible until permission is given. 
“Finally, if a sale is necessary, we want to make sure that the guardian makes reasonable efforts to communicate with the individual and family about preserving some items that are of great sentimental value to the person,” Hirschel said, noting that her group had heard a number of stories where guardians had disposed of items that held enormous meaning to their wards and the individual’s family.

Rana Lechlitner of the Michigan Guardianship Association said that the group appreciates the intent behind the two bills, but noted Irwin’s Senate Bill 585 would require a conservator to pay for an appraisal of their charge’s home out of pocket, adding additional financial strain to an already stressful role. 
Additionally, in most conservatorship cases, the list price for a house is established before the house is placed on the market, Lechlitner said, though the approval process varies widely across counties. 
“We believe there is an opportunity to build on these strong local practices by considering a uniform statewide standard that protects individuals assets without imposing unnecessary costs or delay,” Lechlitner said. 
Jennifer Warnos, the executive director of Guardianship Finance and Advocacy Services also offered her support for the policies alongside suggestions to improve Johnson’s bill, including clarification that a judge can provide approval to move someone under guardianship from their residency after they have already been moved due to an emergency situation. 
Instead of mandating a full court hearing to determine if an individual under guardianship should be moved, Warnos asked if the judge could place their written approval or denial within a case file to meet the bill’s requirements, in order to avoid burdening with the legal fees associated with a court appearance and filings. 
Warnos urged lawmakers to include family members under the two bills’ regulations and to clarify the definition of “residence” in Johnson’s bill, warning it could pose challenges for high-needs wards who move often. She also noted that guardianship clients range in age from 18 and up, not just older adults.
Committee advances policies on water affordability, energy efficiency improvements for low income households
Before taking testimony on the Irwin and Johnson bills, the committee advanced a package of water affordability bills to the Senate floor after similar efforts stalled last session. 
Senate Bills 248–256, led by state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) passed the committee without opposition, though Sen. Jonathan Lindsey (R-Coldwater) opted to pass while voting on several bills in the package. 
The committee also referred another policy, Senate Bill 562, to the Senate floor. The bill would direct more federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program funds toward housing upgrades by removing the state’s 15% cap on weatherization funding and requiring at least 12.5% go to improvements such as insulation, air sealing, thermostat installation and furnace upgrades.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Louisiana stepped in at the start of the month to replace food assistance the federal government was withholding as part of the continuing shutdown. But now that two separate courts have ordered the Trump administration to use a contingency fund to resume assistance, the state has pulled back some of the aid it has already doled out. 
The Louisiana Department of Health said Wednesday it has recalled benefits deposits it has made since Nov. 1 so that those Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients can get more aid from the federal government. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has said it will issue half of the typical monthly SNAP payments it provides for November because the $6 billion emergency fund it will use to pay them won’t cover the full cost. 
That 50% portion is more than the 25% Louisiana had planned to distribute each week in November to SNAP recipients. Last month, Gov. Jeff Landry ordered the Louisiana Department of Health to use $147 million in state funds to provide food aid for the elderly, disabled and families in need, effective Nov. 1.

Rather than issue the entire monthly payment at once, the governor said the benefits would be handed out in 25% portions each week. The elderly and disabled, who usually receive their SNAP benefits during the first few days of the month, would remain first in line, while families would see their payments in numerical order based on their Social Security numbers.  
The governor said any “able-bodied” person who had received SNAP benefits but didn’t fit into one of the priority categories would need to turn to food banks. But with the federal government resuming its payments, all of the nearly 800,000 qualifying SNAP recipients in Louisiana will receive assistance — 50% for the time being — including the 53,000 Landry had pointed to food banks, state officials said.
“We will be waiting for the government to open up and/or additional guidance being published before we make any decision on any further state program expenditures,” Louisiana Department of Health communications director Emma Herrock said when asked whether the state would cover the remaining 50% of SNAP assistance in November.
Before the shutdown, SNAP payments for a family of four averaged $715 per month or just less than $6 per day for each person, according to USDA figures.
Herrock said the people who had state payments removed from their EBT cards are the elderly and disabled recipients who received funds Saturday through Tuesday.
If the D.C. shutdown extends beyond November, the governor can tap into a reserve account the state has set aside for revenue shortfalls. State lawmakers approved a resolution last month supporting the emergency measure.
White House officials said Tuesday the administration would “fully comply” with rulings from federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island that required the USDA to use its contingency funds for SNAP payments. The statement was meant to clarify remarks President Trump made on social media, indicating federal food assistance would not resume until Democrats in Congress acted to end the government shutdown.

(Wisconsin Examiner photo illustration).“Do you ever wonder why there are Black neighborhoods?” Derek Handley, an associate professor of English, African and African Diaspora and Urban studies at UW-Milwaukee, asks his students. How did Milwaukee County become one of the most segregated counties in the country, and what has that meant for the generations of families who either benefited from that bigotry, or were the targets of it?
On Saturday Handley, alongside fellow UW-Milwaukee professor Anne Bonds, will unveil a new project that deeply examines the historic use of racial housing covenants in Milwaukee. From 1-3 p.m. at the Milwaukee Public Library’s Centennial Hall, the professors will present “Mapping Racism and Resistance,” the culmination of three years of work and reflection by thousands of Milwaukee residents.

Racial covenants were legal clauses in property records that explicitly prohibited people who were non-white from living within, occupying, owning or even being present on certain properties. The first covenants in Milwaukee popped up  in the city of Wauwatosa in 1911, 10-20 years before neighboring states established similar practices. Covenants in Wauwatosa and the rest of the Milwaukee area pre-date the practice of redlining,  where financial institutions systematically denied mortgages and financial investments to residents from Black and minority neighborhoods, and which began in 1938. 
In fact, the covenants set the stage for later forms of discrimination like redlining. Bonds explained that redlining was “a process that re-enforced and layered upon racial covenants” and that the level of racism in some communities was so strong it motivated entire neighborhoods to send the message to Black, brown and non-Christian people that they were not welcome. 
Covenants became popular during the 1920s and continued into the 1960s, even after multiple Supreme Court rulings rendered them illegal and, in theory, unenforceable. 
Sometimes the covenants were established before houses were even built in an area. Other times neighbors spent time and money in the courts to create covenants in already developed areas. “It cost money,” said Bonds, “it wasn’t cheap to go and then insert these racial covenants into their property records kind of after the fact.” Not only did covenants root themselves in communities which did not yet have Black residents, there were actually more restrictive covenants than there were Black residents of Milwaukee from 1910 to 1960. Milwaukee had a very small population of Black people when covenants arose, Handley said, adding, “there were three times as many covenants as there were Black people.” Bonds stressed that, “None of this is really passive in any way, shape, or form…It’s a very active whites-only kind thing.” 
That history “disrupts the notion that Jim Crow only happened in the South,” Handley told the Wisconsin Examiner. Never before has a map of racial covenants centralized or visualized those records for study. A network of over 6,000 people helped transcribe and analyze 1.9 million images of deeds, wills, court cases, property records and other Milwaukee County documents from 1910-1960. The records needed to be indexed, converted and checked by five different people to verify that they were covenants. Although computer programs helped organize the bulk of the data, human volunteers were needed to sift out false positives and to verify the findings. 
Anne Bonds, UW-Milwaukee
Mapping Racism and Resistance is both a crowdsourcing effort and a reckoning for the community. Not only does it map where the racial covenants were in Milwaukee County, “but more than anything we wanted the project to be about teaching people more, exposing people to more about the mechanisms and the kinds of techniques that were used to segregate cities,” said Bonds. “And it’s really painful to see this language, and jarring…It’s really jarring. It’s one thing to learn about housing discrimination and to say, ‘Yeah, people didn’t want to live by people who were not white.’ It’s another thing to see that language that says, ‘This home can never be occupied by anybody of the colored race.’ And to see that language inserted in a legal document, it’s pretty eye opening.” 
Mary Roberts, one of the project’s volunteer transcribers who helped upload and verify the covenants, was shocked by what she saw. Having grown up in Sheboygan when the community was essentially whites-only before attending UW-Milwaukee, Roberts had a peripheral understanding of Milwaukee’s housing covenants. Now at retirement age, she was drawn to the project out of a desire to get involved in social justice issues in the city. 
“I have to confess, I did not really understand it,” Roberts told the Examiner. “I understood it in the abstract, but it really deepened my understanding in a way that I just don’t know if I can fully explain. You know, reading in black and white these very calculating and cold and indifferent property deeds…It was incredibly eye-opening to me.” Seeing the racial covenants went far beyond any lesson that can be learned in school, Roberts said. “I was born in 1965, so some of the racial covenants I found were like, they were living, breathing documents in my lifetime. So I went into this thinking that it was really more about history, but it is a living history that was really present in my lifetime. And I think that was very surprising to me.” 










These documents, as I was transcribing, really hammered home to me how systemic the racial inequities were…They were built into the system. And when you read document after document and they’re saying the same thing and you think, every property deed you read is a property, it’s a family, it’s a life, and how widespread it was…


– Mary Roberts, Mapping Racism and Resistance volunteer transcriber on reviewing racial covenants.


A large portion of the covenants reviewed by Roberts were established in Wauwatosa and largely discriminated against Black people. However, she also found covenants from Greenfield, and others which also included Jewish people and other non-Christians including  Armenian people and Asian people. Covenants also existed to the north and east of Wauwatosa, as well as in Milwaukee’s Sherman Park, Sunset Heights and Roosevelt Heights neighborhoods on the South Side near the airport. “A lot of people talk about the way that Milwaukee is surrounded by its predominately white suburbs,” said Bonds. “And certainly when you look at the racial covenants, you can see that pattern playing out, that they surround the city of Milwaukee.” 










Wauwatosa has a significant amount of racial covenants. And folks would know, and Black people would know — and this is across the country — where you couldn’t go, where you shouldn’t go, where you could be, where you can not be. 


– Derek Handley, an associate professor of English, African and African Diaspora and Urban studies at UW-Milwaukee


Roberts noticed that the covenants seemed to put the racial clauses alongside other restrictions like not being allowed to have livestock, or how close a lot could be to a street or property line. She described the covenants as “this very cold, unemotional, sickening language that really is treating people like farm animals, or like an out-building.” 
“So much of the language really was like, you know, no person of African American descent, no one who’s Armenian, could live at this property ever, unless you were a servant. Some of them even excluded servants from properties…It says that in one spot, and then in the next spot it says you can’t have any farm animals at this property. So it was really equating people to really sub-human status, essentially.” 
The Greenfield covenant Roberts found was created by neighbors who’d formed a homeowners association and signed their names to the record. As she transcribed the records, Roberts found herself thinking of her own life, and how the property she lives on now had been passed down through three generations of her husband’s family. “We could never have built the house that we did if we had not inherited land from his dad,” said Roberts. “So it really hammers home in a way that I think other things don’t, that ability to build generational wealth was really denied to a whole class of people in our community. And that those inequities persist today, because that is how things were back then.” 
The same aspect of the project struck Handley when he and Bonds met the descendants of Zeddie Hyler, the first Black homeowner of Wauwatosa. In 1955 Hyler sought to build a home in Wauwatosa, but had to get a white friend to buy the property before he could begin. Local residents attempted to harass him out of the neighborhood, and even resorted to arson. Hyler’s descendants told the professors that Hyler and his brothers were forced to camp out with shotguns in order to protect the house. Hyler died in 2004, and his home has been designated as a historic place.

Handley recalled looking online to compare the value of the Hyler family home with the house he’d moved from in Milwaukee’s Bronzeville neighborhood. “We’re literally talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars, so the racial wealth gap is so significant because of housing discrimination,” said Handley. Resisting racist housing practices took bravery and ingenuity. “Black people in Milwaukee knew about it, NAACP was actively fighting against it,” said Handley.
In the early 1940s, NAACP Attorney George Brawley surveyed plats filed in Milwaukee County and found that about 90 percent of the subdivisions in Milwaukee County since 1910 had some type of restrictive covenant which “pledged the owner not to sell or rent to anyone other than Caucasians.” Wilbur and Ardie Clark Halyard, who founded Columbia Savings & Loan Association in 1924, helped give Black people, poor whites and other disadvantaged groups the opportunity to get a loan to buy a house. While other states focused on winning in court, key players in Milwaukee worked on economic efforts to “break into certain neighborhoods, to provide the economic means for Black people to get the support they need to purchase homes, and then try to find pathways into those neighborhoods,” Handley told the Examiner. 
This history of defiance is also something the professors hope the Nov. 8 unveiling of Mapping Racism and Resistance will reveal to people, especially those who may not believe that the housing covenants really played a role in shaping their community, or who doubt that their legacy continues to endure. Hyler’s story particularly shows how far people would go to maintain whites-only communities. Although the covenants became unenforceable after the 1960s, communities like Wauwatosa maintained racist attitudes. In the late 1980s, a whistleblower exposed that Wauwatosa police officers, firefighters and residents were attending annual Martin Luther King Day parties where attendees wore Black face, distributed fliers suggesting hunting Black people instead of deer, and other racist behaviors. 
In late 2020, Mayor Dennis McBride acknowledged that “the Wauwatosa I grew up in was a racist, almost totally white community,” though he denied that it struggles with racism today. Earlier that year, some Wauwatosa residents received letters which stated: “We Whites must stand together. We must keep Wauwatosa free from Blacks and their lack of morals. We must keep Blacks from destroying our property, raping our wives and daughters, and recruiting our children into street gangs. We MUST keep Wauwatosa great. Together we can keep Wauwatosa White! Together we can keep Wauwatosa safe!” The Wauwatosa Police Department said that it didn’t plan to investigate who distributed the letters, and the department focused on surveilling and disrupting Black Lives Matter protesters that summer. 
Wauwatosa didn’t elect its first Black alderman until 2022. The following year, Wauwatosa’s common council voted to request that the state dissolve its housing covenants, which still exist today as invalid clauses of deeds passed to homeowners upon buying certain properties. Other Milwaukee-area suburban communities, like Brookfield, continue to struggle with accepting affordable housing developments and newcomers.

Bonds cautions against the impulse to erase uncomfortable histories. Most people don’t want to live in a home with racist ownership clauses, Bonds told the Examiner, and “it’s a relic of the past, and something that is obviously really dark.” Yet, Bonds said, “We are wary of erasing the record,” because “removing them today obscures the work that they’ve already done. We can take them out of here now, but it doesn’t mean that they didn’t have an impact. It doesn’t mean that they didn’t do the work that they were set out to do when they were implemented in the first place.” The covenants conferred legal and economic power regardless of whether people who have benefited from them are “able to see it or understand it,” said Bonds.
A fully interactive website planned as part of the project has been delayed due to grant cuts, and Bonds and Handley are also working on a book. Viewers will be able to look up covenants for properties, and get down even to the parcel-level. “I definitely see this as just part of a longer study of trying to understand housing and the availability of housing to all residents of Milwaukee County,” said Bonds. “We really view this as a community project.”  
Roberts says Mapping Racism and Resistance captures an important history for people to see, especially people whose families have lived in communities built on a foundation of covenants and redlining for generations. “It’s important to not look away from that,” said Roberts. “And unless we’re having these tough conversations, I don’t think anything can get better.” Handley agreed, adding, “this is part of Milwaukee’s history, and what we can learn from it, and what we can do moving forward.”

The legislation ranges from restricting how ballots can be returned to county clerks, limiting acceptable voter identification, banning ballot drop boxes, mandating automatic hand recounts in certain instances and upping the campaign filing requirements for independent candidates. 
Most of the legislation comes from the Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee, which held its last off-season meetings Monday and Tuesday in Cheyenne. Elections were the committee’s top priority ahead of the 2026 session. 
While the scale of the legislation pales in comparison to the 45 bills lawmakers filed during the 2025 legislative session earlier this year — only a fraction of which made it into law — local election officials are concerned about having enough time to implement changes ahead of next year’s elections. 
“In a moment of bearing our soul a little bit, there is a lot of anxiety amongst county clerks about the number of bills passed in the last session and have the potential to pass in this session,” Platte County Clerk Malcolm Ervin told the committee. “And some of them have an easier administrative burden, some a significant administrative burden. And so I would ask both sides of this committee really think about that.” 
Wyoming’s primary elections aren’t until Aug. 18, but county clerks’ work begins months before that, as the committee was informed in great detail via presentation during a May meeting in Lander. 
“Realisitically, when these bills are being heard in the session, we’ll be in the first quarter of the football game,” Ervin said Monday. “And it’s hard to change those rules as the game is underway.”
As such, the Wyoming County Clerks’ Association made several suggestions to the committee, including delaying effective dates and forming a working group to study audit-related reforms. The committee, however, charged forward with the encouragement of Secretary of State Chuck Gray. 
“I’m thrilled that these election integrity bills have passed to be sponsored by the Joint Corporations committee in the upcoming 2026 legislative session,” Gray said in a statement. “They include common sense election integrity measures like requiring photo identification for voter ID. I’m going to continue working to pass these bills through the legislative process, just as we worked to pass proof of citizenship for registering to vote and other election integrity bills in the 2025 Session.”
In August, Gray and the Wyoming Freedom Caucus backed the Trump administration’s plans to stop states from using voting machines and mail-in ballots. The exact details of Trump’s plans remain to be seen since no executive order has yet been issued. 
Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, a member of the Freedom Caucus, reiterated that position in October to a subcommittee charged with investigating the actions of Weston County Clerk Becky Hadlock, who has come under fire for her role in an election miscount last year. 
“Paper ballots and a hand count would have stopped all this and would have never even got out of the gate,” Neiman said. 
Neiman ran unopposed for reelection to House District 1 last year, and found himself at the center of an election snafu when a suspiciously high number of voters appeared to have left their ballots blank in his race. It was soon discovered that Hadlock had used a combination of the correct ballots and misprinted ones. A hand count ultimately resolved the results. 
Since then, however, Hadlock submitted a post-election audit with false information and then failed to appear before the subcommittee at a meeting in Casper, despite being subpoenaed to do so. Gov. Mark Gordon is now tasked for the second time with investigating Hadlock’s actions. 
Jill Kaufmann, a Wheatland resident, pointed to the fallout in public testimony she delivered to the Corporations Committee.
“The one question of all these wonderful bills that we worked through, which one would have stopped Weston County? Not one,” Kaufman said. “We need to get really serious about the purity of our vote.”
In response, Jackson Democratic Rep. Mike Yin asked Kaufman, “Do we need to pass any of these bills if they don’t actually fix the problems that we’re actually facing in Wyoming?”
Without getting rid of the state’s electronic election equipment — which Kaufman encouraged the committee to pursue — she said the legislation was necessary to address “some of the periphery of the problems that we have.” 
In October, the Management Audit Committee voted to sponsor three bills directly related to elections in response to Weston County. 
Two of those bills dealt with the post-election audit process while the third  would expand the process for submitting a verified complaint against a county officer to the governor in instances of election code violations. 
The committee also voted to sponsor a fourth bill to stiffen the penalties for ignoring a legislative subpoena, but that would not be limited to situations related to elections. 
The 2026 budget session starts Feb. 9.

From Deaver to Hanna, small-town libraries struggle as their budgets are slashed. It’s one downstream result of Wyoming’s new property tax relief.
The post Cuts, closures and more to come: Wyoming’s property tax policy ripples into libraries appeared first on WyoFile .","GREYBULL—Shawnea Chestnut grew up immersed in the books of her small-town library, which shares a building with the museum next door. 
“Right over there,” she pointed toward the children’s section. “That’s where I was.” 
Now the 26-year-old is assistant library manager. Chestnut works here four days a week, organizing young-adult fiction programs, looking up books for patrons, assisting users on computers and offering after-school crafts for kids. Outside of her work, the University of Wyoming grad is pursuing a master’s degree in library science. 
But Chestnut knows the Greybull library could land on the chopping block. With shrinking property tax revenues, budget cuts have already closed two branches and reduced services in the Big Horn County Library system.
“It’s depressing and scary,” Chestnut said. 
If the Greybull library suffers a similar fate, Chestnut would lose a job she loves. But more than that, she said, kids would lose a safe place to go when school’s out, and locals would lose the chance to visit a welcoming space for resources and information.
It’s a scenario being batted about in library systems across Wyoming as county governments wrestle with declining tax revenue. 
Nobody, it seems, wants libraries closed. But, many say, this is among the impacts advocates warned lawmakers about last spring when they urged them to vote against a measure reducing residential property taxes. The Wyoming Legislature passed a new 25% exemption on the first $1 million of a property’s fair market value, and as a result, the revenue pools for municipalities and special districts have diminished. 
Impacts have touched everything from park maintenance to hospitals around the state. Several libraries have felt the pain acutely.
In Wyoming, county governments are required by statute to operate one library in their county seat, but they regularly operate additional branches in outlying towns. Because satellite branches are not statutorily mandated, many have been considered for cost reductions.

County officials say library system cuts are a matter of necessity and not a reflection of their support. The tough conversations around library budgets, however, are exposing tensions between library administrators and elected officials. 
With more tax-cutting proposals on the horizon, the budget crunches are only expected to worsen.
“The reduction in property tax, obviously, is harming our counties,” Gov. Mark Gordon said at a recent town hall in Lander. “These consequences are going to be larger and larger.”
Communities are increasingly looking toward non-governmental organizations for fiscal lifelines and rethinking traditional funding of free public services. Outside options, many worry, may not be sustainable in the long run. 
The situation distresses Tina Ely, the director of Big Horn County’s library system. The county’s library branches serve many roles, she said — people visit them to build their résumés, find summer activities for their kids, take continuing education classes and even select seeds for their gardens. 
“It’s not just a place to check out books,” she said. “It’s a community place.”
‘Insufficient funds’
It was a warm and windy Thursday afternoon in Saratoga, and Jane Laughlin walked into the small library on the edge of town a little before closing time. The cottonwood trees were flaming in the golden tones of October, and a sign on the door advertised “books that’ll make you howl.” 
Since the library recently cut its Friday hours, this was the last day of the week for Laughlin to run her errand.
She came to write a check for $100 to the Saratoga Friends of the Library. The part-time resident had recently heard the Carbon County Library System was facing a budget crisis, she said, and she wanted to help.

“I just hope we can keep it going,” she said. Laughlin brings her grandchildren here, uses the computer and checks out books. The nearest library branch is 40 miles away, she noted, too far to just pop in for a visit. She was optimistic that Saratoga patrons would find solutions. 
“I think this community is good at rising to the occasion,” she said. 
Saratoga is among the seven branches operating in Carbon County — a sprawling 8,000 square miles stretching from ranches near the Colorado state line to Saratoga along the North Platte River to county seat Rawlins on Interstate 80. 
The system used to have eight branches. The Sinclair library closed in 2024 due to already-existing budget constraints. 
When the Carbon County Commission tackled its budget this summer, plummeting property tax revenues meant it had to find $900,000 to cut, Commissioner Sue Jones said. In that process, the commission made a significant cut to the library system budget, dropping it from $350,000 in 2024-2025 to $164,462 for ‘25-26. 
The 53% cut sent staffers, board members and patrons into an “all-of-the-above” strategy for keeping the library system afloat, said Library Board Chair Adelaide Myers. A public outreach campaign plastered branches with notices like this one: “OUR LIBRARIES ARE RUNNING WITH INSUFFICIENT OPERATIONAL FUNDS.”

The library system reduced branch hours and dipped into savings, and the board voted to close small branches in Hanna and Medicine Bow. They also leaned into fundraising opportunities. The library system and friends groups managed to raise more than $130,000 in private donations and grants — largely via Embrace the Valley, a matching fundraising event through Brush Creek Ranch. Friends groups, particularly in Saratoga, raised the bulk of the money, and the library board is now working through the process of how those funds can help keep services alive, Myers said. 
It’s not as easy as just replacing the library system’s losses, however. 
“When we have a $186,000 shortfall, $139,000 goes a long way,” Myers said. “But we also have to recognize that that’s not our money. That is the friends groups’ money.”
The funds did spur the library board to delay the Hanna and Medicine Bow closures. However, there is no guarantee they will stay open, she said, especially with the budget picture trajectory. 
“We have to plan for a really difficult year next year,” she said. “We prepare for the worst and expect the best.”
Tensions emerge
On a hot morning in July, a crowd of people gathered in lawn chairs and on the grass in front of the Lander Library for a silent “read-in.” Many brought signs that proclaimed support for Fremont County libraries. No one shouted slogans. They just read in silent solidarity for the library. 
While they didn’t have an explicit message, the sit-in took place on the heels of the Fremont County Commission’s budget process, which created a ripple of dismay in the community after commissioners announced the county would cut library funding by $300,000, or 23%.
The library system was not the only department to suffer cuts. Fremont County made a total of $2.5 million in cuts to its overall budget. Positions were left vacant, contracts reevaluated and fees hiked.

But many supporters felt the library cut was undue and carried a whiff of disapproval from the conservative commission. Fremont County commissioners denied this, pointing to the array of cuts they imposed to balance their budget. 
Ultimately, the Fremont County Library Foundation stepped in with a $100,000 donation, and the system obtained county approval to re-allocate an additional $100,000 earmarked for collection development in order to backfill. And while the remaining shortfall will result in reduced staff hours, the system’s three branches in Lander, Dubois and Riverton will be able to continue most services. 
Similar tensions are playing out elsewhere as county governments reckon with less revenue.
In September, following Carbon County’s budgeting process, Library Director Maria Wenzel resigned after three years on the job. Wenzel declined to comment to WyoFile about the reasons she left. 
Commissioner Jones acknowledged that the process was fraught. But she defended the commission, which imposed hiring freezes and reduced office hours in county government while also making painful cuts to its so-called outside agencies. With the latter, that meant eliminating funding for economic development completely and reducing funding for senior services, the museum and library system.

The county’s budget is easily misunderstood, Jones said, leading the public to think the commission should spend money that it can’t. The commission’s hands are tied in certain matters, she said, and it needs to keep reserves healthy. 
Jones sees encouraging signs like a library fundraising event she attended this fall. “They were doing fundraising for their local library in Encampment, which to me, is absolutely wonderful, because communities need to buy in,” she said. 
Outside fundraisers could play an increasing role in propping up nonstatutory services like libraries and museums, Jones said, and should be seriously considered. 
Little towns lose out
Big Horn County Library Director Ely doesn’t usually get sick, but in late September, she was fighting off the latest in a string of bugs. 
It could have been the stress. 
In the last year, she’s had to contend with the complicated equation of how to keep running the county’s five branches with much less money. 
“We had gotten a cut the year prior,” Ely said, and “we had been kind of warned by the county commissioners that this budget was going to be even worse.”
And it was. When it was presented in July, Ely and her team discovered the county commission had cut the budget from $350,000 the previous fiscal year to $280,000.

With the reduction, Ely said, they axed Wyoming retirement benefits as well as paid time off for all employees. They trimmed employee and operating hours. They cut programming funds and travel costs. 
“The staff took a hit,” Ely said. “So far, they’re all able to hang in there with us. But of course, at least three of them have a second or third job, and they stay with us because they love the library.”
Hardest of all, they closed the Frannie and Deaver branches.  
“We were just desperately looking for places to save,” she said. “It seems minimal, but we saved about $10,000 a year by closing Frannie and Deaver.”
Patrons in those small towns were devastated, Ely said. Even at the branches that remain operating, she said, patrons have been upset about cuts. There’s not a lot that Ely and the Big Horn County Library Board can tell them except the truth, she said. 
“It’s been very difficult,” she said.

Budget cuts have mounted in recent decades, she said, so fretting about closures wasn’t new. But still, she was “very upset” when she heard the news.
“These little towns just tend to lose everything,” Yates said. Local schools have been consolidated, postal services diminished. “They were always kind of proud of having the little libraries, and now they were taking that away.”
In October, the towns of Frannie and Deaver reopened their branches, which now operate on volunteer labor one day a week. Yates intended to be part of that volunteer staff. 
Vicious cycle?
Library directors who spoke to WyoFile feel they have been cut to the bone. When they contemplate future budget choices with ever-shrinking revenue, they’re at a loss.
“We are going to make it through this year,” Ely said. “I just don’t know what the future looks like.”
Ely thinks eroding services will likely come as a hard lesson, demonstrating the kinds of things property taxes fund. “I think it’s going to be a wake-up call,” she said. 
Carbon County Library Board Chair Myers said the current fundraising fix “cannot be our forever plan. We need to be funded.”

She is reaching out to lawmakers and encouraging others to follow suit to let them know that property tax reductions are wreaking damage down the line. 
The roundabout result of cutting residential taxes, she said, could be that property values fall, “because people don’t want to move to a community that doesn’t have a fire department, doesn’t have police, doesn’t have libraries, doesn’t have senior centers, it doesn’t have all these services that we take for granted that our property taxes pay for.”
It triggers a vicious cycle, she added. 
“I don’t know what the answer is,” she said. “I just know that cutting property taxes without backfilling to the counties and municipalities and school districts that lost those revenues is not a good idea.”

Because we never know when we, or someone else, will be in need, it's best to live life ready to share, writes columnist David Romtvedt. 
The post Planning for little emergencies appeared first on WyoFile .","For many years, we cut our winter wood from storm-downed cottonwood along one of the creeks at our family’s ranch. In two or three days, we’d cut the year’s supply for our house in town. The first day was spent scouting a good location where there was a tangle of wood not far from a flat area where we could park our ancient tractor and a six-horse trailer. We’d set up a 36-inch circular saw blade mounted at the end of a hinged platform on which you could place the length of wood to be cut. The blade was driven by a leather belt connected to the power take-off of the tractor. It was a little nerve-wracking pushing the wood toward those steel teeth that were inches from both the hands of the person holding the wood in place and the hands of the person who picked up each cut piece as it fell to be thrown into the horse trailer. 

Opinion

Sometimes the woodpile we found was so tangled we couldn’t pull the branches apart. Using the winch at the front of our Jeep — nearly as old as the tractor — we’d wrap a loop of steel cable around a log to pull it free. In logging, the person who wraps the cable around the log is the choker setter, and maybe because I’d done this work briefly as a young person in the Pacific Northwest, this was often my task. If I picked the right log, its release would untangle the pile, and we could pull out what we wanted to cut. 
When the horse trailer was full, we drove to town and stacked the wood in the garage and in an attached shed. Most years, we cut more wood than would fit under cover — you never know how long winter will last — so some wood would be stacked just inside the fence along the alley in full view of passersby. Squirrels ran in and out of the stacked wood, and neighborhood kids sometimes took a piece or two for some game they were playing.
As I brushed snow off the top of the pile, I imagined that if it were really cold, a person could step quietly under cover of night through the gate and into the yard to take a few pieces of wood for a fire. There was a wheelbarrow by the woodpile that such a person could use to haul off the wood. As each piece hit the wheelbarrow’s metal bottom, it’d ring like a bell. I’d turn in my sleep and smile, remembering my father-in-law who always left the keys in his truck and the doors unlocked. “You never know when someone might have an emergency and need a vehicle,” he told me.
Time passes and things change — our ranch, which is mostly split estate, has largely become a rural industrial site for extensive fossil fuel extraction. Older members of the family have died and the younger have become the older. We’ve admitted how dangerous that unprotected circular saw blade was. The tractor and the Jeep wait patiently in a shed. We buy our firewood from a local woodcutter who delivers it in half- or quarter-round pieces. I stack it and later split it into smaller pieces to burn. 
Just as in the past, I often have some wood left over from the previous year. This fall, I again stacked the excess wood in the alley, but outside the fence, where anyone could reach it as they passed by. A few days after stacking the wood, I was working in the yard and noticed that the wood pile looked different. I hadn’t yet taken any pieces to split and burn, so I asked my wife, who heats her pottery studio with wood, if she’d taken some. “No,” she said, “it’s so warm I don’t need a fire yet.”
“That’s weird — something’s different. I don’t know. It’s not how I stacked it.”
A week or so later, the weather changed. I went to the woodpile in the alley and when I picked up the first piece to split, I found a dollar bill wedged below it. Someone had taken a piece of wood and left me a dollar. I thought of my father-in-law leaving the keys in his unlocked truck, and of how little we know of the needs of others. And I thought how nice it was to find the dollar, a reminder that people mostly try to pay their way. 
Maybe I’ll put a jar out by the woodpile with a note — take what you need, leave what you can.

(Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin Superintendent Jill Underly faced more criticism from lawmakers on Wednesday as the Joint Legislative Audit Committee reviewed the findings of a financial reporting audit and launched an audit of the agency’s licensing procedures.
During the first three hours of the committee hearing, Underly’s absence was a major discussion point for lawmakers on the committee as they reviewed the financial audit. She has also faced criticism for being absent about two weeks ago at the Assembly Government Oversight Accountability and Transparency committee meeting when she was in Indiana to accept an award. 
“This body is extremely disappointed that right now, when we’re going over an audit that probably impacts over $12 billion in what’s spent by our educational legal entities, that Dr. Underly is not joining us,” Rep. Robert Wittke (R-Caledonia) said, adding that the committee provided details on the meeting weeks in advance.
Wittke said Underly is the only agency head who has not come before the committee when it is discussing an audit. 
“You don’t get the governor out of every hearing, do you?” Superintendent Deputy State Superintendent Tom McCarthy said. “Dr. Underly is an elected official and has dispatched us to manage parts of these duties, and that is why you have me at these, because she does take it very seriously and is staying deeply briefed.” 
“It’s interesting, you say that she’s an elected official, but when I had an audit before us that included the Department of Justice, it appeared that Attorney General [Josh] Kaul could be in front of us and comment on that,” Wittke said. “Constitutionally, she supervises the educational system here, whether elected or not, and… so, I would think that it would be something that she would want to address.”
Wittke quipped that maybe McCarthy should be signing off on the audits instead of Underly. 
Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) said he found it “very concerning” that Underly was not at the hearing to discuss the first audit and her absence is a sign of “cowardice in a leader.” 
“To send the people who work for you in to take heat and not take it yourself would make me have a lack of confidence in my leader. I wouldn’t expect Superintendent Underly to have all the answers. Oftentimes an executive leader does not. They’re managerial… to defer to you to answer is quite different than not being available to be held accountable,” Wimberger said. 
The committee launched the audit into the financial reporting and the agency’s process for reviewing audited financial statements following a financial reporting scandal at the Milwaukee Public Schools last year. 
MPS faced significant criticism from lawmakers especially as the information came to light shortly after the district passed a $252 million operational referendum.
“The problem was recurring and compounding to a point where DPI was having difficulty appropriating funding accurately. That information was hidden from the public until after MPS convinced voters locally to approve a $200 million referendum,” Wimberger said during the hearing. “I’m sure voters would have had a different opinion of whether MPS needed money if they knew the district was so unaware of their internal finances.” 
In accordance with state statute, DPI monitors financial school districts’ financial statements  with a requirement that schools submit annually. Schools must contract with a certified public accounting firm, which submits the audited financial statements to DPI. 
Financial information from public schools and independent charter schools is required to be submitted by Dec. 15, under DPI policies. Voucher schools are required to submit financial information by Oct. 15 each year.
MPS was a recurrent discussion point during the hearing, though the audit found that MPS is not the only district with difficulties submitting documents on time.
Among schools’ 2022-23 audited financial statements, the Legislative Audit Bureau found that 77% were submitted on time and 22% were submitted late. For school districts that submitted on time, the agency took on average 87 days to complete its review of those audited financial statements.
Of those submitted late, 70% were submitted at least 29 days late. 
The audit looked at a sample of 18 school districts that submitted their statements late, finding that the agency contacted those districts 47 days after the Dec. 15, 2023 deadline. 
Milwaukee Public Schools’ audits for that year were submitted on Dec. 20, 2024, about a year after the due date —  the latest among all 421 school districts.
McCarthy said Milwaukee Public Schools had been historically late in turning in the district’s  annual audit, but it typically came with communication about why they were late and a commitment that the district would have the audit submitted in the following weeks. 
“That was not a normal year of being late for them,” McCarthy said of December 2023. 
When the lateness of the school district’s reports came to public attention, DPI said it had been meeting with MPS quarterly since April 2023, monthly since February 2024, weekly starting in March 15 2024 and then daily in May 2024 to get the district to submit its reports. The agency has since placed the district under two corrective action plans and withheld over $50 million from Milwaukee schools. Gov. Tony Evers has also launched separate audits of the district.
Wimberger expressed concern that MPS was given a “two-year grace period.” 
McCarthy said he believed the agency was “pretty strict” with the district. 
“If you consider withholding $51 million to be grace, I’ll call you next time we have a problem,” McCarthy said. 
“We used the tools and authority that we had at our disposal to compel the district through two separate corrective action plans, stood shoulder to shoulder in trying to clean up some of the local aspects of what’s going on, and I think the current superintendent has been deeply engaged in committing resources and staffing to making sure that this does not happen again,” McCarthy said. 
McCarthy said the situation with MPS has been a “long, painful journey that we don’t ever want to repeat with any other district.” 
The legislative audit found that DPI does not have a requirement that agency staff contact schools that haven’t submitted financial statements and audits on time. 
The Legislative Audit Bureau made 22 recommendations to DPI to improve its processes. 
Those recommendations included establishing written policies to require that it contact school districts within one month if their documents aren’t submitted by the deadline and regularly contacting schools until those audits are submitted. It also recommended that the agency establish a written policy that implements a deadline for starting its review of audited financial statements and completing those reviews. 
The audit bureau  made similar recommendations for DPI in overseeing private voucher schools and for the Department of Administration in overseeing the financial information for independent charter schools. 
McCarthy said that the agency is taking the audit bureau’s recommendations into consideration. That includes putting in writing all communication with district administrators and school boards as late reporting occurs.
McCarthy also noted that the agency has launched a school financial transparency dashboard that allows people to “dive in and look at any district” including reviewing records of compliance for reporting. 
“I’m glad you’re moving forward to try and crack the systemic problem, in my opinion, that deceived the public in the passing referendums without understanding the true financial situation of their respective district,” Wimberger said. 
Licensing and sexual misconduct audit
Underly was present during the latter half of Wednesday’s hearing, testifying on the agency’s licensing policies and changes it plans to make, especially  to investigations into educators accused of sexual misconduct and grooming. 
“Where were you this morning?” Wimberger asked.
“I was at the DPI,” Underly replied. Wimberger did not push the point. 
Underly repeated much of her testimony from the Tuesday Senate Education Committee including laying out some of the steps the agency is taking, launching a new webpage with the list of educators who have surrendered their licenses or had them revoked, as well as the changes she wants to see lawmakers work on, including providing additional resources for the agency’s licensing responsibilities and closing the loophole that allows unlicensed teachers to work in private schools.
The Joint Legislative Audit Committee voted unanimously to launch an audit into DPI’s policies and processes for educational licensure revocation, suspension, restriction and investigation. The audit will look at trends in the DPI’s investigations, its policies and how Wisconsin compares to its midwestern neighbors.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)CoreCivic has seen a substantial increase in revenue over the past six months, driven by a steady rise in new federal government contracts signed as part of President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement policies.
The Brentwood, Tennessee-based private prison operator announced its quarterly earnings Wednesday, telling investors that its revenue was up 18% compared to the same period in 2024, when Trump wasn’t in power and the federal government appeared to be cutting ties with the privately-owned prison industry.
“We expect detainee populations to continue to grow as [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)] implements its interior enforcement plan, contributing to a strong 2025,” said CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger, in a news release.
CoreCivic was one of a handful of private prison operators in a strong position to financially benefit from Trump’s return to the Presidency, as it inked multiple contracts to house detained immigrants in facilities in over half a dozen states. The total value of these contracts is over $680 million.
From July to September 2024, CoreCivic generated $140 million in contracts from ICE. Over that same period this year, revenue increased to $215 million, and the company expects it to grow further, CoreCivic announced during its earnings report.
West Tenn. town approves CoreCivic to run immigration detention facility after chaotic meeting

Since Trump’s January inauguration, his administration has increased its strict and harsh crackdown on those in the United States without citizenship, leading to a spike in arrests and pushback on the tactics of the administration.
ICE and Homeland Security agents have been seen patrolling in cities across the country. Agents have also been accused of entering homes without warrants in Portland, unlawfully arresting U.S. citizens in Los Angeles and using tear gas to confront community protests in Chicago.
In Memphis, these federal officers have been seen making arrests in unmarked cars and wearing face masks that completely cover their faces, making them unidentifiable. Many of the ICE arrests in Memphis have resulted in people being detained at a CoreCivic facility in Mason, Tennessee.
CoreCivic, which generates over $2 billion in annual revenue, has long been a federal contractor for immigration detention, playing a significant role in Trump’s first term. In 2021, former President Joe Biden’s administration tried to phase out all federal contracts with private prison companies.
The company spent $120,000 lobbying on Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” which included significant additional funding for ICE, according to the federal political spending tracker Quant Quiver. Hininger gave $300,000 to Trump and affiliated PACs during the 2024 election, and another $500,000 to his inaugural committee, Open Secrets reported. 
The move led to the initial closure of the West Tennessee CoreCivic-run prison in Mason. But the company in August reupped its contract with the city
CoreCivic also makes a portion of its money from state contracts, including a $230 million deal to run four state prisons in Tennessee. Those prisons have generated tens of millions of dollars in fines from the state over management issues related to the death of inmates, and triggered a federal civil rights investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice.
CoreCivic is one of the largest political spenders in Tennessee. From 2010 to 2024, the private prison company spent more than $2.7 million to lobby lawmakers and made another $1 million in campaign contributions, according to the Lookout’s political spending database.

(Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia’s food banks received less state funding this year in a Republican-sponsored budget bill signed six months before Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits were delayed, skyrocketing the current need for free food giveaways. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey
Gov. Patrick Morrisey has recently funneled more than $8 million to the state’s food banks after thousands of SNAP users in West Virginia didn’t receive their benefits at the start of November because of the federal government shutdown. He plans to give an additional $2.5 million more in state funding this week while the state is working to give out a reduced SNAP benefit amount under guidance from the Trump administration.
They’re meeting the need, Morrisey said, and food banks have thanked him for the money.
Earlier this year, the Republican governor’s first proposed budget didn’t include a line item request to fund food banks at the same level as previous Gov. Jim Justice. The Republican-led Legislature didn’t add in the fund, either, and now there are calls for it to return next year.
In 2023, Justice launched the Posey Perry Emergency Food Fund, a $10 million reserve account dedicated to combating food insecurity in West Virginia. The fund would be split between the state’s largest food banks, Mountaineer Food Bank and Facing Hunger Foodbank, then food pantries could apply for the emergency funds to purchase food.

Kellie Gunnoe, director of Raleigh County United for Prevention, said the funding was how she funded her organization’s food pantry that serves 150 households a month. 
Now, she relies on community donations and competes with other nonprofits for grants to continue providing food boxes to families. 
“We have to piece it together,” she said. “It’s more difficult because what’s happening is that foundations are wanting to give something to everybody, so amounts are a lot lower.”
Morrisey’s press secretary, Drew Galang, responded to a question about why the governor didn’t request money for the Posey Perry fund with, “Governor Morrisey has continually worked to ensure that no West Virginian goes hungry. The fastest, most efficient way to complete that mission was through the utilization of contingency funds. As of Thursday, more than $11 million will have been released to food banks across the state. Should the Schumer Shutdown continue, he will not hesitate to call in the legislature.”
Facing Hunger Food Bank Executive Director Cyndi Kirkhart said she advocated for years to have a line item in the budget for food banks as West Virginia had some of the nation’s highest hunger rates. Justice was excited to help the cause, she said, and he came up with the fund name.
“I think one of the challenges this year was we didn’t have a relationship with Gov. Morrisey and his administration, either. And I think that right now, in real time, the governor and his administration are really seeing the importance of providing support to the food banks and the food pantries,” she said. 
Kirkhart stressed that the challenges now — while increased — are not new. One in six people in the state face hunger.
“Because of the absence of that funding, clearly it’s required,” she said. “There are hungry people every day of the year. If it’s not the absence of SNAP benefits, it’s inflation, because those SNAP benefits never are going to go as far as a family’s total needs,” she said. 
Caitlin Cook, director of advocacy and public policy for Mountaineer Food Bank, noted that along with declining state-level funding, they’ve lost federal funding, too.
“The additional assistance both on the state and federal level have dwindled, but prices at the grocery store continued to rise, utility bills continued to rise. All these things put an extreme amount of pressure on the charitable food network,” Cook said. 
“Unfortunately, food insecurity has become more prevalent,” she said. 
Lawmakers consider reinstating the Posey Perry emergency food fund 
The budget bill passed in 2023 included $10 million for the Posey Perry fund by name. The following year, state lawmakers gave $10 million to the fund in an appropriation during a special session. There were additional state funds set aside for feeding programs, as well. 
Lawmakers could have added the Posey Perry fund in this year but it wasn’t publicly discussed as they worked on a skinny budget. The legislation did say that leftover funds in the Governor’s Office budget could be given to the Posey Perry fund.
Their final budget bill included $1 million for the Community Food Program, which serves food banks, and $426,000 for food banks through the state’s Department of Agriculture. 
Senate President Randy Smith and House Speaker Roger Hanshaw didn’t respond to a question about whether either chamber had discussed adding the Posey Perry funding into their respective budget bills.
Del. Evan Worrell
Del. Evan Worrell, R-Cabell, said he plans to ask his Republican colleagues to restore funding to the Posey Perry emergency food fund in the upcoming legislative session. 
“While this grant funding does not help the current food needs we have before us, it does highlight the need to ensure the Posey Perry fund is restored for the next fiscal year,” he said on Wednesday. 
Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, noted that the fund was created through bipartisan efforts.
“ … It’s a shame this administration didn’t see the need in continuing it. The hunger insecurity issues in West Virginia did not start as a result of this federal shutdown, nor will they end when it’s resolved,” Young said. “I encourage the Morrisey administration and the Legislature to prioritize feeding our most vulnerable and to pass systemic policy changes we’ve put forward that will lessen the need for these supplements in the first place.”
Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha
Gunnoe hoped lawmakers would return the funding to $10 million annually, saying, “This money really goes for families. There’s a lot of emphasis on education and education choice, and we’re so behind on feeding.”
“They can’t absorb any of this education when they’re hungry,” she added.
Cook echoed the need for the Posey Perry fund. “I think both COVID and [the government shutdown] really put a spotlight not only on high food insecurity in the state, but the infrastructure that exists in the state between the two food banks and their member agencies and the necessity of having funding and some state buy in to support that charitable food network,” she said, adding that they’ve been in constant communication with Morrisey about current needs. 
Morrisey last week expedited some of lawmakers‘ most recent funding for food banks to help during the delayed SNAP benefits. He also used $100,000 that was appropriated by lawmakers the previous year, according to the governor’s office. The rest of the food bank money has come from the governor’s contingency funds.
He has pledged around $14 million to food banks while West Virginians wait for reduced benefits on an unknown timeline. 
“If I determine that after the $14 million we need more resources, I will call the Legislature back into session, and I will ensure that West Virginians don’t get hungry — period,” Morrisey said on Wednesday at a news conference. 
House Democrats have called on Morrisey to give more money — noting $500 million sitting in the governor’s contingency fund — to food banks and to directly fund SNAP as other states have done.

I like the sound of that word. I came up with it when I read that Montana Senate President Matt Regier had submitted the first bill draft request for the 2027 legislature (nothing like being first out of the gate) to make sure that teachers do not have what Regier calls political agendas when it comes to teaching Montana’s children.
The controversy developed when a person made clandestine recordings of a few meetings at the PIR (pupil-instruction-related) meeting put on by the Montana Federation of Public Employees teachers conference in Missoula last October. He then broadcast them on social media. He focused on discussions in four of the 320-plus different seminars offered. Teachers who attend the conference receive pay through their school districts. For the full background you can read the story here.
Before discussing “thinkalike,” it’s important to define some terms. First of all, it means: Think like I do. When a speaker talks about another person having a political agenda (bad), they mean that the (bad) agenda differs from the speaker’s political agenda (good). And who decides that the political agenda (bad) is bad? Why it’s the speaker who holds the political agenda (good).
Regier said, “We need to make sure that tax dollars aren’t going towards political agendas in our schools.” 
What he is saying, essentially, is that our tax dollars aren’t going towards political agendas that differ from his political agenda.
It’s important to understand that a “political agenda” is nothing more than a demeaning term for a differing opinion, and as someone once noted, a difference of opinion is why we have horse races. To settle the matter.
It’s important to be the first at labeling an issue. The Republicans are very good at that. No, let me be fair, the Republicans are very, very good at that. Take the phrase “family values.” 
How can Democrats be against that? They simply can’t. They have to think up another label for something that means the same thing as “family values” to support, which they can’t, and even if they could, they wouldn’t all agree on whatever it was. 
George Orwell wrote that words have emotional meanings rather than definitions. We kind of know what democracy means, but we definitely know it means something good. Likewise, fascism and authoritarianism, whatever they might actually mean, have connotations of being bad. Because of that, nations do not name themselves “The Fascist Peoples’ Republic of (North) Korea”, but “The Democratic Peoples’ Republic of (North) Korea.”
The key to understanding “thinkalike” is that it is not based on facts, but opinions. And for the promoter of “thinkalike” the task is to turn those opinions into facts. The way that is often done is by repetition and naming. If you call someone a “fascist” often enough the term begins to stick and thereby becomes true—a fact. Likewise with any term, “liberal,” “communist,” “dictatorship,” you name it. And the key to defining the term is to associate it with bad or good things. I don’t know who it was who said “repetition is truth” (the usual person credited with the idea is Hitler’s Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels) but it works. If you hear something often enough from enough different people, it must be true.
The problem with “thinkalike” is that it suppresses thinking about anything. Learning comes from considering differing opinions to arrive at a conclusion. Think about a crime. The detectives may take different approaches to the solution and along the way discard some ideas, revive others, or through the process of thinking try a completely new approach. Sometimes they have to consider information that is uncomfortable or controversial, but the entire purpose is to solve a crime. To discover the truth. So, too, with most things in life. Some things are uncomfortable to think about, but if the goal is to find a good solution or process, everything has to be considered and discussed. This does not mean they are endorsed, but scrutinized in the search for the truth.
Freedom of speech, freedom of thought, and freedom of opinion are the backbone of truth and democracy. As the world’s first and longest lasting democracy, let’s not screw it up with “thinkalike.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2208801178-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-06 06:16:32.528302

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson/Tennessee Lookout)Four Fayette County Public Schools employees filed a lawsuit on Oct. 23 against the district’s school board, alleging a pattern of racial discrimination and retaliation against Black teachers and administrators.
The next day, the district’s superintendent fired one of them. 
Former Transportation Director Bobby Champion, a Fayette County Schools employee of 21 years, joined three other Black employees in the lawsuit, stating that they were wrongfully demoted after speaking out against the actions of school board members and district leaders.
Champion’s termination letter, reviewed by Tennessee Lookout, states only that all employees who are not required to hold a teaching certificate “are employed at the will of the Director” and that Champion’s employment is “being terminated.”
Thomas Minor, attorney for the Fayette County Board of Education, did not respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit and the circumstances of Champion’s termination.
Champion was demoted from his director role to the position of shop foreman in July. The change came with a $12,000 pay cut, the lawsuit states.
The school board then informed Champion that he was placed on administrative leave as of Sept. 19, pending an investigation into “several irregular practices … (in) the Transportation Department,” according to the lawsuit.
Fayette Co. Schools seeks end to desegregation case; Black constituents say they’re being ignored

Champion’s termination letter did not mention this investigation. 
The suit states that Champion’s demotion and suspension happened after Champion challenged school board members’ “illegal and unethical actions targeting experienced Black administrators and educators.”
Other plaintiffs in the lawsuit include:

Towanda Maclin-Brown, a 25-year Fayette County Schools employee who said she was demoted from her role as central director of the Innovation Office with Fayette County Board of Education to an assistant principal position and took a pay cut of $20,000 after she voiced concerns about “rumored arbitrary changes to the district’s organization chart”;
Brian Cunningham, a 16-year employee who said he was demoted from his role as a high school principal to an assistant principal role at an elementary school, with a pay cut of $13,000;
Marquette Yates, a 19-year employee who said she was demoted from her role as district school counseling coordinator to a school counselor position with a $12,000 pay cut.

The lawsuit states that the demotions lacked “legitimate business justification” and “similarly situated non-Black employees were not subjected to demotions or salary reductions.”
Fayette County, the Fayette County School Board, former interim superintendent Eddie Keel and School Board Chairman Warner Speakman are named as defendants in the lawsuit. The defendants had not yet filed a response to the lawsuit with the U.S. District Court in the Western District of Tennessee as of 5 p.m. on Nov. 5, online records show.
The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys Jonathan Mosely, Handel Durham, Jr. and Kenneth Margolis. Mosely said they intend to file an amendment to include Champion’s firing in the lawsuit.
The plaintiffs are seeking a jury trial and up to $1.9 million combined in damages for economic losses and emotional pain, in addition to reinstatement to their former positions.
The lawsuit comes after a tension-filled year for the school district, which considered staff reductions as a budget-saving measure during its summer budgeting process. Employment decisions prior to the start of the 2025-2026 school year were made under the leadership of then-Interim Superintendent Keel, who was named deputy superintendent after the school board selected Don McPherson as the permanent superintendent in July. 
A group of organizers and West Tennessee residents called for the “reinstatement of all demoted or terminated teachers to their original positions without retaliation” prior to the school board’s Aug. 14 meeting. The demonstrators also called for greater transparency from the board, the resignations of Speakman and Keel, fair governance training for the Fayette County mayor and the redrawing of district maps to ensure equitable representation.
The Fayette County Commission redrew its district maps in late June to include three majority-Black, single member districts after being sued by the U.S. Department of Justice and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Those lawsuits were dropped following the maps’ adoption, and the new maps will be used in 2026 elections.
The school board voted in February to declare unitary status, a move that would release the school district from federal monitoring that has been in place since 1965 after the government found that Fayette County had failed to appropriately desegregate its schools. A U.S. District Court judge approved a new consent decree in 2023, recognizing the district’s progress and restricting its desegregation obligations to include improvements to efforts to recruit and retain diverse faculty, revisions to disciplinary policies and improvements to gifted student programs and dual-enrollment classes. 
To dissolve the consent decree, the plaintiffs would need to agree that the school system has implemented the order in good faith, or the court would need to hold a hearing to determine the district’s compliance. 
Fayette County Schools submitted its annual report to the court on Oct. 15. It has not filed a motion for declaration of full unitary status and case dismissal.

Colombo, who is recovering from back surgery, walks with a cane. When she made it to the front of the line, a companion helped her load potatoes, onions, and boxes of macaroni and cheese into a cart. 
Normally, Colombo would use her SNAP benefits to buy groceries and supplement that with two pantry visits at the middle and end of each month. Because of the government shutdown, however, that resource is gone. She’s gotten creative, cooking up a pumpkin that Connecticut Foodshare distributed around Halloween, to make a puree for her grandchildren, who live with her. And she’s visiting food pantries three times a week.  
“You could cry about it, it’s not going to change nothing,” she said. 
An estimated 360,000 Connecticut residents benefit from SNAP, and food pantry directors say they’re working hard to meet the need, with uncertain resources.  Enrollees received SNAP benefits through October 31, but have not received new funds since Nov. 1.

Calls to Connecticut’s 211 line also convey the reality in stark terms, with ten times the number of inquiries about food assistance compared to the same time a year ago, according to the United Way of Connecticut, which runs the help line. 
The future of the food assistance program remains uncertain as the longest government shutdown in U.S. history drags on. A federal judge ruled on Friday that the Trump administration must tap reserve funds to replenish EBT cards, but this week the administration sent conflicting messages about whether it would replenish the cards partially or not at all. Connecticut leaders have also sent mixed signals about how they will fill the gap.
Amidst the confusion, pantry lines convey a grim present-day reality: SNAP cardholders are currently not receiving benefits to feed their families.
Sarah Santora, the director of community programs for Connecticut Foodshare, was handing out flyers at the pantry in East Hartford on Wednesday, letting people in line know where other food distribution sites are located. Santoro said that Connecticut Foodshare has noted a 30% to 50% increase in pantry visits across the state, “and in some places much more.”
Santoro said she’s fielding calls at Connecticut Foodshare from people looking for help. 
“They’re very, very worried about what they’re going to do if this doesn’t end soon,” Santora said. 
In Torrington, Friendly Hands Food Bank Executive Director Karen Thomas said she was trying to maintain a stable amount of food distributed to each household amidst an inundation of new clients, many of whom she described as panicked. The food pantry has cut back on the amount of meat and fish on offer, making it difficult for families to feed their kids a well-balanced diet on mostly shelf-stable items.
“The fresh produce, veggies, things of that nature — those are few and far between.” 
At the Midwest Food Bank of New England in Manchester, pantry directors came to collect food to distribute in their communities.
“I’m getting multiple calls every day, people are walking in every day wondering what help they can receive,” said the food bank’s executive director Corey Barrette. “We’re faced with the stark reality that you can’t be everything to everyone. And the further you stretch yourself the less helpful you are to the people you’re trying to help, and that’s a painful place to operate from right now.” 
Joan Soucy, the director of the Andover Congregational Church Food Pantry, was visiting the Midwest Food Bank on Wednesday to restock.
“We’re feeling the pinch,” Soucy said. “Our shelves are getting pretty empty.” 
In Bridgeport, the Thomas Merton Family Center runs both a food pantry and a soup kitchen. 
“There’s lot of anxiety and trepidation about what’s happening now, and how long it’s going to go on for,” said Nicholas Martinez, the direct of the center. “On Friday, we basically ran out of food during lunch, which never happens.”
Martinez said he was seeing a lot of new faces, people who had never needed the center’s resources before, especially families with young children. “It hurts” to see, he said.
Food bank directors emphasized that while donations of food are greatly appreciated, money can allow them to get much more food out to people in need, because they are able to use funds to pay drivers, trucks, gas and other costs toward collecting bulk quantities of donated food. 
“With only three paid staff and thousands of volunteers who help us do the work, we can keep our costs really, really low,” Barrette said. “We would never turn food away, but we also want people to recognize that, because of the nature of our operating model, we’re not buying the food that’s out there. We are looking for food that is being donated so we can pick it up at a very low cost and turn around and give it away, and as a result we can stretch the dollar much further.”

Wednesday found state Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, at the Midwest Food Bank, pulling donated packets of noodles and cans of beans from a box and sorting them into piles. Dozens of other volunteers were seated around tables, eating a communal lunch, but Anwar abstained. He’s been on a “SNAP Diet” for the past ten days to raise awareness about the precariousness of Connecticut’s food insecure and has been living on $6.20 of food a day, what an adult would normally get in SNAP funds.
By midday, Anwar had only consumed a cup of tea. He had a banana, apple, and serving of peanut butter waiting for him in his car for lunch — he was trying to delay eating as long as he could. Later, at home, he’d have dinner — likely a combination of rice, beans, and frozen vegetables.
Anwar said that sticking to the $6.20 budget requires him to be strategic. He brings any food he plans to consume during the day with him. He shops carefully to ensure he’s getting some protein and produce in his diet. And he saves his single full meal for the evening.
Anwar said his goal is to raise awareness, posting photos of his meals on Facebook, in hopes people will support the food insecure during this especially precarious time. The irony, of course, is that people who normally receive SNAP benefits don’t even have that $6.20 to spend right now.
“It’s a personal perspective to experience what people are experiencing, and that gives you more empathy and respect, and hopefully the vigor to do more and stand up,” Anwar said. “If that gets some attention, then I can shine light on the real issue that people are experiencing.”
Anwar was quick to acknowledge that his experience was a choice, and therefore inauthentic. “The real experience is what so many people have as a daily reality.” 
While the Lamont Administration has given an additional $3 million to Connecticut Foodshare, the state’s largest food bank, to supplement missing food, Anwar said that is merely symbolic.
“We’re not doing enough. I think to have a press conference about $3 million, which will add up to one day or one and a half days of support? It’s more about the press conference than actually doing it. Just roll up your sleeves and fix the issue. People are hungry and we have the resources.”

(Photo by Dragos Condrea/iStock Getty Images)The social safety net, including health care and food benefits, has been under attack this year, threatening the stability for millions of Americans, and hundreds of thousands in West Virginia.
The longest federal government shutdown in history has made food benefits, officially called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, a part of the national conversation over the last month. 
The federal government provides funding to states to operate SNAP for individuals and families in need. Throughout October, news media and public advocates raised alarms about the likelihood of the program running out of funding at the end of the month. States led by Democratic attorneys general sued the Trump administration to force it to use reserve funds to keep SNAP funding going. The court ordered the administration to do so for the whole country. Even so, it appears President Donald Trump plans to do that in a subpar manner.  
(Yet again, West Virginia stands to benefit from court orders telling the Trump administration it must or can’t do something, despite state Attorney General J.B. McCuskey refusing to lift a finger to protect his constituents from the president’s job, program, funding cuts or other illegal actions.) 
But this isn’t the first time this year the federal government has had SNAP in its crosshairs. This summer’s reconciliation package, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, contained provisions that will lead to an estimated 3 million people getting kicked off the SNAP rolls. These provisions include burdensome reporting requirements as well as eliminating exemptions for veterans, parents and people in areas with high unemployment. The Congressional Budget Office expects the federal government to reduce SNAP spending by $187 billion over the next decade. 
It’s not just Congress and the president who have been attacking SNAP and other aspects of the safety net, like Medicaid, this year. Our own neighbors in West Virginia engage as well. 
Against my better judgement, I’ve been spending too much time on Facebook. I saw a local reporter post in a community page asking to speak with folks who were worried about losing SNAP benefits because of the shutdown. Cue the flood of mean-spirited comments questioning the morality, laziness and health of the people who receive SNAP. 
These comments often rely on flawed, negative stereotypes and overlook a few things. For one, there’s the fact that the average SNAP benefit is quite frankly not a lot. In West Virginia, the average enrolled household receives $258 a month. Then there’s the idea that the typical person who receives SNAP is a mooch or a “welfare queen.” Nearly half of SNAP households have someone who is disabled. Someone has to take care of that person, which can make it difficult to maintain a stable well-paying job and not be in need of SNAP benefits. In West Virginia, we “take care of our own” and that should extend to people within our very own households. 
Fox News recently ran a story covering TikTok videos featuring people who are complaining about the possibility of losing their SNAP benefits for their many children, and why that would be a burden because the parents don’t want to work. It turns out those videos were AI and Fox News had to correct the story. That resonated with people, even supposed journalists, because the myth of the undeserving welfare recipient is so strong and pervasive. 
SNAP isn’t partisan. Perhaps some people still think of an inner city person of color as the average SNAP recipient. But millions of white people, or people in conservative states or rural areas rely on SNAP to help put food on the table. Despite that truth, President Donald Trump and others have tried to label SNAP as a “Democrat program” to justify freezing the funding now and gutting it later. 
SNAP’s importance to all Americans and our communities is so clear that Republican Sen. Josh Hawley sponsored a bill with other Republicans to keep SNAP operating during the shutdown. 
During the spotlight on SNAP funding drying up, few are questioning why one in six Americans rely on SNAP funding and tens of millions are on Medicaid. It’s not because people refuse to work. In West Virginia we have a perfect storm of terrible factors. Wages are low. Good jobs are hard to come by. Housing is substandard, as is access to quality health care. If you can find a job, reliable transportation can be a barrier. 
Instead of judging people who rely on the social safety net, we should be reexamining the structures that make it so easy for tens of millions of people to live in poverty.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Colorado did not have a marquee contest on the ballot Tuesday similar to those seen in other parts of the county, such as New York, California, New Jersey and Virginia. But the nationwide repudiation of the Trump agenda that emerged from the off-year election results was nevertheless apparent in numerous Colorado races and ballot measures.
The state had a small platform, but the message was loud and clear.
It cut through most irrefutably in the defeat of Danielle Jurinsky, the MAGA Aurora City Council member who as much as anyone in the state whipped up the kind of hostility toward immigrants that now fuels the cruel, lawless implementation of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation program. She was the leading purveyor last year of the false claim that Venezuelan gangs had perpetrated a “complete take over” of Aurora, which prompted Trump to amplify this lie during a campaign stop in Aurora.

Aurora voters on Tuesday booted Jurinsky, but not only that, left-leaning candidates appear to have swept all five Aurora council races, which could flip a longstanding conservative majority.
Progressive or liberal causes and candidates dominated elsewhere in the state. In Arapahoe County, they appear to have run the field in the large Aurora Public Schools and Cherry Creek Public Schools districts. Teacher union-backed candidates were ahead for all four Denver Public Schools board seats that were up for election. Conservatives in Douglas County for years had a majority on the tumultuous local school board, but their reign appears to be over as unofficial results show Democratic-backed candidates sweeping all four open seats.
The only statewide contests in Colorado on Tuesday were a pair of propositions that would shore up funding for the state’s free school meals program. The two measures — referred to the ballot by Democrats in the Legislature — were passed. 
This was Colorado’s contribution to the national progressive triumph Tuesday that’s widely seen, at least in part, as a response to authoritarian attacks on democracy. Big-ticket wins included:

Zohran Mamdani elected New York City mayor
Mikie Sherrill elected New Jersey governor
Abigail Spanberger elected Virginia governor
California voters approve new congressional maps 
Democrats become first statewide constitutional office holders in Georgia since 2006
Pennsylvania retains Democratic state Supreme Court majority

There were many others.
Trump himself in a social media post Tuesday night appeared to acknowledge that Republicans were shellacked. He attributed the losses to his own absence from the ballot and the federal government shutdown, which began more than a month ago under Republican majorities in the U.S. House and Senate.
The Colorado Democratic Party agreed that the results are due in part to the shutdown.
“Trump and the Colorado GOP must take note of these results and end their government shutdown that’s jacking up costs, stripping people of their SNAP benefits, and causing chaos in working class households (in) the state,” the party said in a statement Tuesday night.
Progressive observers in Colorado also attributed wins for their side to the larger threat of Trumpism. 
“Since Donald Trump took office, he has waged a horrific and unprecedented war to divide and punish Americans, and tonight voters in Colorado and across the nation powerfully reaffirmed the values that make America great,” Sara Loflin, executive director of ProgressNow Colorado, said in a statement.
This has implications within the Democratic Party as its candidates jockey for nominations in the 2026 Colorado elections, particularly the contest for governor, which in this blue state will very likely go to the winner of the Democratic primary.
U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet was widely seen as the frontrunner when he entered the race, but Attorney General Phil Weiser’s left-flank campaign increasingly appears more aligned with voters in the base, which demands a vehement defense of democracy.
The outcome of Tuesday’s election is a message for Republicans, but it also has a lot to say to Democrats.

The 14-percentage point beating that Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger inflicted on Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears was the largest since Bob McDonnell’s 17-point trouncing of Democrat Creigh Deeds 16 years ago. After more than 400 years, Spanberger will be Virginia’s first woman governor.
Democrats sweep Virginia’s statewide races, reclaiming full control of executive branch

Jay Jones, who was left for dead after his dual reckless-driving and snuff-texting scandals became 2025’s October surprise, was somehow elected attorney general by a comfortable margin over GOP incumbent Jason Miyares.
Ghazala Hashmi, who will be the first Indian American and Muslim to hold statewide office in the commonwealth, won a double-digit victory over conservative former radio host John Reid, a Republican who was vying to become Virginia’s first openly gay statewide elected officer.  
And in the House of Delegates, Democrats have flipped 13 seats to control almost two-thirds of the 100-member chamber when the General Assembly convenes in January. Among the defeated GOP incumbents is 18-term Del. Bobby Orrock of Spotsylvania who had survived numerous close calls in his 36-year House tenure.
If you’re looking for a kind euphemism, you could call Tuesday “a teachable moment” for the Trump-era GOP. 
What happened here and in New Jersey, where a Democrat also won the only other gubernatorial race in this off-off-year election, was a primal scream – or a big, nasty middle finger if you like – aimed at President Donald Trump. It was a warning sign for the president’s GOP, a stone-dead canary deep inside its own coal mine.
There’s never been any love lost between Virginia and POTUS No. 45 and 47, even though the state’s soon-to-depart Republican governor is among his most faithful supplicants.
Each time Trump has either been a declared candidate or in the White House, he has poisoned Republicans running across the Potomac in statewide elections. Trump himself is 0-3 on the Virginia ballot. From 2015 through 2020, the GOP was zero-for-everything in races for the U.S. Senate or Virginia’s top three executive offices — the same offices his party’s nominees lost badly this week.
Statewide elections like this one were once waged exclusively (and appropriately) on state issues. Raise your hand if you remember “Abolish Parole!” and “No Car Tax!”
To governor candidates pledging a car tax repeal: be careful what you promise

Those resonant Virginia-specific issues were identified and artfully leveraged by two Republicans who were convincingly elected governor in the 1990s: George Allen and Jim Gilmore, respectively. It was Gilmore who, in 1997, led history’s first Republican electoral sweep of all three top Virginia offices.
Now, state elections are hopelessly nationalized, and that’s true everywhere. Candidates of both parties have become so fearful of hardcore activists who control the nomination processes that failing to align with their wingnut priorities is tantamount to political hara-kiri. That’s why so many of the men and women in both parties (and an independent or two) whom I’ve most admired in elective politics got out of the game. 
In 2024, Virginia Republicans got a sobering reminder of the consequences of being less than obsequious to Trump and his whims. Republican U.S. Rep. Bob Good, who initially dared side with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s presidential primary bid over Trump, lost a nail-biter in the caustic 5th District GOP primary to MAGA-anointed John McGuire, then a state senator, who ultimately won Good’s seat.
Many will look at Tuesday and the Virginia GOP’s worst massacre of the 21st century and shrug it off as a blue state doing what a blue state does. That conclusion ignores abundant state political history and squanders two informative takeaways.
The first: Virginia is purple. We can argue whether it’s more of a bluish royal purple or a magenta-tinged lavender. It is, nevertheless, a state that hues to the political center in statewide races, rewarding candidates who offer sober, pragmatic and sensible policy answers and punishing wild-eyed, doctrinaire screamers.
The second: Virginia is pissed. Whether you live in Accomack, Fairfax or Galax, you’d be hard pressed to find Virginians who endorse profligate government spending. But when Trump hand-picked the planet’s richest human to arbitrarily — and literally! — take a chainsaw to their livelihoods by gutting whole federal agencies with little consideration to their necessity or function, that image stuck and curdled.
Because Virginia is purple, its enmity can shift swiftly from one party to the other.
Four years ago, Glenn Youngkin — running as an easy-going pragmatist just to the right of center while skillfully avoiding visible ties to Trump, freshly exiled to Mar-a-Lago — led a GOP sweep of all three state offices and a House majority.
Virginians were unhappy then with what they saw as overreach from Democrats who ruled Richmond and Washington at the time. They chafed at heavy-handed pandemic directives and felt policy swung too far left way too fast.
We all know what drove voters in the election just completed.
In those takeaways are lessons about Virginians that the GOP, at levels high and low, would do well to absorb: expect election nights like this one when you force extreme policy on us just because you can; and one bad election need not define you.
Will Republicans learn? Only they can tell.

(Photo by Getty Images)A coalition of Democratic attorneys general, including Aaron Frey of Maine, are seeking to block the U.S. Department of Education from moving forward on new restrictions for its student loan forgiveness intended for government and certain nonprofit employees. 
The lawsuit was filed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in Boston federal district court on Monday.
The rule published Friday changes the definition of a “qualifying employer” under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program to exclude certain organizations that engage in “specific enumerated illegal activities.” 
Such activities are defined by the Trump administration as supporting undocumented immigrants and promoting diversity and transgender advocacy, the latter described as “engaging in the chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children.”
The 22 Democratic AGs claim those revisions effectively give the U.S. Department of Education broad authority to target specific activities disfavored by the Trump administration.
“To accomplish this goal, the rule purports to empower the Department of Education to serve as a roving enforcer of the administration’s animus by stripping PSLF eligibility from employers whose actions it dislikes,” the lawsuit states. “Put simply, the final rule is nothing more than a laundry list of this administration’s policy priorities designed to attack lawful conduct it does not agree with.”
The AGs argue the rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act and exceeds the Education Department’s authority.
Joining Maine and Massachusetts in the suit are AGs from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.
Created under then-president Geroge W. Bush in 2007, the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program allows government and nonprofit to apply to have their remaining federal student loans canceled after 10 years of service and monthly loan payments.
The coalition is asking the court to declare the rule unlawful and block the new rules from taking effect next year — as does a separate lawsuit filed in Massachusetts by a group of nonprofits and city and county governments.
“Bending the knee to this president cannot and will not be a prerequisite for this program, and we will fight to ensure that politics remains untethered to what it means to be a public servant in America,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement Monday. “Public service knows no political party.”
Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent called the revisions “common sense.”
“It is unconscionable that the plaintiffs are standing up for criminal activity,” he said in a statement Tuesday. “The final rule is crystal clear: the Department will enforce it neutrally, without consideration of the employer’s mission, ideology, or the population they serve.”
The case has been assigned to Judge Myong J. Joun, a Biden nominee.

A controversial new higher education law took effect in Ohio this summer that bans diversity efforts, prohibits faculty strikes, and regulates classroom discussion at Ohio’s public universities. 
The law also creates post-tenure reviews, puts diversity scholarships at risk, sets rules around classroom discussion, and creates a retrenchment provision that blocks unions from negotiating on tenure, among other things. 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed Ohio Senate Bill 1 into law in March and students threatened to leave the state if S.B. 1 became law.
Colleges and universities are also feeling the ramifications of declining birth rates, rising tuition costs, and student loan debt. 
The national birth rate fell nearly 23% from 2007 to 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning the traditional college-age population will start dwindling this year through 2037, according to data from the Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education.

Lawmakers in more than half of the states have introduced over 100 bills this year to either expand or limit capital punishment, to alter execution protocols, and to change how death sentences are imposed, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit that studies capital punishment. The group does not take a position on the death penalty, but it is critical of how it is carried out.
Some of the bills seeking to expand the death penalty would have included crimes that have been hot-button issues, such as the killing of police officers, sexual offenses against children, abortion and crimes committed by people living in the country illegally. Lawmakers in at least seven states this year also have attempted to legalize alternative methods of execution.
Earlier in the year, however, some Republican legislators in conservative states — including Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Ohio and Oklahoma — proposed measures to abolish the death penalty or impose moratoriums to halt pending and future executions. None of those efforts advanced through their legislatures.
Georgia, meanwhile, enacted a law barring the execution of people with intellectual disabilities.
Trump’s death penalty push faces resistance in some red states

Nationally, and with about two months left in the year, states have carried out 41 executions. This marks the largest number of executions in the nation since 2012, when there were 43. Five more are scheduled in Florida, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee.
“Executions mark a particular moment in time. They mark the punitiveness of the moment. … It’s no surprise to me to see execution spiking,” Corinna Lain, a law professor at the University of Richmond, told Stateline. Lain also is the author of the book “Secrets of the Killing State: The Untold Story of Lethal Injection.”
The surge in executions comes as President Donald Trump has encouraged use of the death penalty. On his first day in office in January, he signed an executive order ending the Biden-era federal moratorium on executions and directing the U.S. attorney general to seek the death penalty “for all crimes of a severity demanding its use.”
The order requires federal prosecutors to pursue capital punishment in two circumstances — when a law enforcement officer is killed or when the accused is an immigrant living in the country illegally — regardless of other factors. It also instructs the U.S. Department of Justice to help states obtain lethal injection drugs, though it remains unclear how it would do so.
Stateline asked the Department of Justice whether U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has taken any steps to help states obtain lethal injection drugs. The department declined to comment.
Trump’s January executive order further calls on the U.S. attorney general to urge state and local prosecutors to pursue the death penalty in all eligible cases and to seek the reversal of Supreme Court precedents that limit state and federal authority to impose capital punishment.
The order applies only to federal crimes; states set their own death penalty laws.
Since 2009, seven states — Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Virginia — have legislatively abolished the death penalty, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Twenty-seven states allow the death penalty, but four — California, Ohio, Oregon and Pennsylvania — have paused executions.
Seventeen death penalty-related bills were enacted into law this year across nine states, according to the Death Penalty Information Center’s legislative tracker: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana, North Carolina and Oklahoma. Seven of those laws expand death eligibility or add aggravating factors for capital cases. Others focus on limiting eligibility, modifying execution protocols — including adding alternative methods of execution — or changing the appeals process.
Despite the surge in executions this year, the number of new death sentences imposed on convicted murderers continues to fall amid concerns about how executions are carried out, and because prosecutors are seeking the punishment less often. And both the number of executions and new sentences remain far below their historic highs in the 1990s.
“Death sentencing is falling in the United States for reasons that an executive order cannot fix,” Lain said.
‘Iryna’s Law’
One of the most sweeping measures this year came out of North Carolina.
Known as “Iryna’s Law,” it makes broad changes to the state’s criminal code following the August killing of Iryna Zarutska on Charlotte’s light rail system. The law imposes stricter pretrial release conditions on defendants, mandates mental health evaluations for some defendants, shortens appeal timelines in capital cases and adds new execution methods.
“I hope we can finally get justice for victims’ families and for the people of North Carolina,” Republican state Sen. Phil Berger said in a news release. Berger has long backed efforts to resume executions in North Carolina. The state has not carried out an execution since 2006. There are 122 people on North Carolina’s death row.
Most states provide lawyers for this critical death penalty appeal. Not Alabama.

Under the law, courts must schedule hearings for any capital case filings older than two years by December 2026 and resolve them by the end of 2027 — an accelerated timeline aimed at moving stalled cases through the system. The measure also adds a new aggravating factor allowing prosecutors to seek the death penalty for murders committed on public transportation.
The law lifts state bans on electrocution and lethal gas as execution methods, though it keeps lethal injection as the primary method. If lethal injection were to be ruled unconstitutional, the state could adopt any execution method used elsewhere that has not been struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Democratic Gov. Josh Stein signed the measure into law in October, but raised concerns about the provisions that open the possibility of alternative execution methods.
“It’s barbaric,” Stein said in a video explaining his decision to sign the bill. “There will be no firing squads in North Carolina during my time as governor.”
Florida has led the nation with 15 executions so far in 2025. Alabama and Texas have had the second-highest number of executions this year, with five each. The vast majority of executions this year occurred in Southern states, with only five taking place elsewhere — two in Arizona, two in Indiana and one in Missouri.
States have faced chronic shortages of lethal injection drugs for years, and many manufacturers and pharmacies refuse to supply them for ethical reasons. Combined with high costs and drugs that often expire before use, these challenges have forced delays, cancellations or the use of alternative execution methods.
Executions often occur decades after the original sentence, as people on death row may spend up to 30 years exhausting their appeals. Nationally, nearly 2,100 people are currently on death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Legal precedents
Expanding the death penalty to crimes beyond murder has become a central focus of federal and state officials seeking to reshape capital punishment laws.
A key precedent comes from the 2008 Supreme Court case Kennedy v. Louisiana, in which the court ruled it unconstitutional to impose the death penalty for crimes other than homicide or crimes against the state. In that case, a man had been given the death penalty after raping his then-8-year-old stepdaughter.
In September, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier led 15 Republican state attorneys general in sending a letter to Bondi and White House counsel David Warrington, seeking federal support to challenge Supreme Court precedent and uphold death sentences for child rape.
“We believe repairing Kennedy’s flawed outcome is within the power of the States,” the attorneys general wrote.
The letter cited Trump’s January executive order and noted the recent enactment of state laws authorizing the death penalty for child sexual abuse in several states, including Arkansas, Florida and Tennessee. This year, both Idaho and Oklahoma made sexual assaults of children offenses eligible for death.
“For many victims, the pain and trauma never fully go away,” Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin, a Republican, wrote in an email to Stateline. “The death penalty is entirely appropriate and necessary to deter future wrongdoers and achieve justice for the victims.”
Griffin also wrote that he hopes to bring a case before the Supreme Court to challenge the Kennedy precedent in the future.
Sentencing trends
So far this year, 16 people across the country have been sentenced to death — one of the lowest totals in more than a decade, according to Lain, who independently tracks new death sentences. In 2024, 26 people were sentenced to death.

She said this reflects a long-term shift: Juries and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty less often, but the states that continue to use it are doing so more aggressively.
“Today’s death sentences are tomorrow’s executions,” Lain said in an interview. “If you don’t have new death sentences feeding the machinery of death, the death penalty will die on the vine.”
The push to expand the death penalty comes as support for it has waned. A Gallup poll in October found 52% of Americans back capital punishment for murder, down sharply from 80% in 1994.
Critics have long highlighted persistent racial disparities and the risk of wrongful convictions. Since 1973, at least 201 former death row prisoners have been exonerated, and about 40% of current death row inmates are Black, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
A 2024 analysis by the nonprofit Reprieve, which advocates against the death penalty, found that since 1982, 8% of lethal injection executions of Black people were botched, compared with 4% of executions of white people. Lethal injection is the most commonly used execution method across the country, though it is also the method with the most recorded botches or mistakes.
The high costs of imprisoning death row inmates, buying lethal injection drugs from unregulated “gray market” compounding pharmacies and navigating decades-long appeals — along with questions about the death penalty’s effectiveness as a deterrent and the secrecy surrounding how executions are carried out — have cast uncertainty over the future of capital punishment across the states.
Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Braun revealed in June that the state spent nearly $1.2 million on four doses of execution drugs, half of which — $600,000 worth — expired before they could be used.
Braun said he does not plan to purchase more drugs, saying, “[S]omething that costs, I think, $300,000 a pop that has a 90-day shelf life — I’m not going to be for putting it on the shelf and then letting them expire.”
Idaho has faced similar challenges. In court filings, state officials said they spent $200,000 on execution drugs that went unused, and a new facility for firing squad executions is expected to cost more than $1 million.
In Texas, state officials have spent more than $775,000 on pentobarbital, one of the commonly used drugs in lethal injections, since October 2024, according to records obtained by NBC News. Tennessee spent $600,000 on lethal injection drugs between 2017 and March 2025, according to records obtained by The Tennessean. During that period, the state carried out two executions via lethal injection.
“At some point, states have to look at the death penalty and say, ‘Is it worth the money?’” Lain said.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)Ongoing fallout from the alleged profanity-laden rant of a Lowcountry congresswoman and gubernatorial candidate against Charleston airport police sent the race for the South Carolina Governor’s Mansion soaring to strange new heights this week.
Cross-allegations and backlash to the reported tirade by Republican U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, which made national headlines over the weekend, continued to escalate Wednesday. Mace’s criticism on cable television news shows and her threats of a defamation lawsuit prompted a bipartisan letter from elected officials rallying behind the airport and its employees. The signers included 26 Lowcountry legislators — most of them Republicans.
Plus, following sparring on social media in the wake of the airport kerfuffle, Mace attempted to turn a routine legislative meeting into a rebuke of one of her four GOP gubernatorial rivals, state Attorney General Alan Wilson.
And in an unrelated twist, a Kershaw County conservation official made allegations of campaign finance violations against Mace, saying Wednesday he filed an official complaint with the state Ethics Commission.
What happened
The saga began Oct. 30 with reports from Charleston airport police stating the congresswoman berated them, calling them “(expletive) incompetent.” Officers did not spot her car when it arrived at the airport, leaving her without a secure escort through the terminal.
Upon catching up to the congresswoman at security and walking with her to her gate, officers wrote in their reports that Mace continued cursing and complaining loudly while on her phone.
According to the airport police report, the public display led to an airline employee approaching the officers after Mace’s departure, expressing disbelief at her “unacceptable behavior.”
In response, Mace accused the officers of fabricating the report and hired a lawyer, saying she plans to sue all involved — including the airline, airport administrators, three officers, and the unnamed gate agent.
“We believe Congresswoman Mace has been subjected to a calculated and coordinated effort to malign her character through deliberately falsified documentation,” Mace’s lawyer Larry Klayman said in a statement Wednesday. “No American, let alone a sitting member of Congress, should be subject to institutional misconduct and defamation of this nature.”
Rep. Nancy Mace officially enters SC governor’s race

In reaction to Mace’s legal threats and public accusations, including at a news conference she called, that she considered the airport unsafe, 62 state and local officials from the Lowcountry signed a letter to the contrary. The group of legislators, mayors, councilmen and sheriffs hopes to undo any damage to the tourism-dependent airport’s reputation.
“Charleston International is more than a travel hub, it is a vital economic engine that strengthens tourism, supports small businesses, sustains thousands of local jobs, and connects our community to the world,” the letter read.
The letter writers went on to express the Lowcountry’s values of “civility, respect, and gratitude for public service.”
“As leaders committed to the well-being, reputation and continued success of the Lowcountry and all of South Carolina, we write to express our strong support for Charleston International Airport and the dedicated professionals who serve there each day,” the letter said.
Ahead of the letter, South Carolina’s two U.S. senators, Republicans Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, rebuked Mace’s behavior on social media. And the South Carolina Fraternal Order of Police sent out a statement backing the airport police.
A routine hearing

As for Wilson, he was not at the airport last Thursday morning but made a show days later of delivering breakfast from Waffle House to Transportation Security Administration agents. It was a not-so-subtle dig at Mace, who often talks about her days as a Waffle House waitress.
Mace named Wilson and his chief of staff among those she plans to sue, though she gave no further explanation as to how they allegedly defamed her.
Mace fired back further on Wednesday by appearing in Columbia at a routine meeting of a Senate oversight panel. A day earlier, on social media, Mace framed the hearing as an investigation into the attorney general, inviting people to tune into the livestream.
In response to out-of-the-ordinary attention to what’s normally “very dry and boring,” the panel’s chairman, Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, started the meeting outlining “what the process is and also what it is not.”
“This is an oversight process, not of an individual, but of the agency,” the Edgefield Republican said. “General Wilson is the head of the agency, but this is not really about General Wilson. This is about the attorney general’s office.”
A 2014 government restructuring law, Massey explained, tasked the House and Senate with reviewing all state agencies every seven years. The attorney general’s office was added to the schedule in 2024, and the review started with a meeting in the spring.
“This is a regularly scheduled hearing,” Massey said.
“Our idea is to try to identify issues before they become issues,” he said, as Mace sat in the audience. “We try to do these oversights on the front end as opposed to what you see in Washington, where there’s a lot of — after it’s already happened, then you have some high-charged meetings.”
The senators in the hearing mostly covered human resources-related issues of burnout, low morale and high turnover, which Massey called not out of the ordinary for an agency that size.
Mace left before the hearing ended but posted a video on social media claiming there was a “whistleblower” who had not been allowed to testify and alleged millions of dollars are being funneled out of the attorney general’s office.
Massey, after the meeting, told reporters he did not know of any whistleblower, and nobody had been scheduled to testify Wednesday.
“We have no idea what Nancy Mace is referring to, and if she has any concerns, she should take them to the oversight committee,” Robert Kittle, a spokesman for the attorney general’s office, told the SC Daily Gazette.
Campaign allegations
After records showed she still hadn’t paid ethics fine, Rep. Mace says she ‘cut a check this week’

Meanwhile, Mace faces her own allegations of financial misdeeds.
William Galloway, of Camden, emailed an ethics complaint accusing the congresswoman of campaign finance violations.
The allegations involved one of Mace’s congressional staff members, whose salary is funded by taxpayers, conducting activities related to Mace’s gubernatorial campaign while on the clock. It also claimed Mace had used an email service, funded by money from her previous congressional campaign, to send out correspondence related to her bid for governor.
State and federal campaign dollars can’t be mixed without written authorization from donors, according to a 2001 opinion from the state Ethics Commission.
Mace, in a statement, said the complaint contained errors. She said the staffer in question was on approved leave at the time of the allegations.
“Second, as is also standard practice, when a candidate switches from a federal to state campaign or vice versa, there are very specific rules on data usage,” she said in response to the complaint.
“Our opponent(s) are dumber than they look,” Mace added. “They did this on the day I announced a lawsuit against American Airlines and the airport and named my opponent Alan Wilson as part of the coordinated effort to defame me. They WILL NOT SLOW US DOWN!”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_3565-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-06 05:16:32.402784

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) is a guest on “The View” that aired on Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025. (ABC/Lou Rocco)Maybe what happened in Tuesday’s election was an anomaly. You could certainly make that case, as many Georgia Republicans have tried to do.
It was, after all, an odd-year election, with relatively low turnout, for two low-profile statewide races. So even if the resulting margins were spectacular – Democrats won two seats on the five-member Public Service Commission, both by 25 percentage points – maybe it was just an anomaly.
Joe Biden’s 2020 victory in the red state of Georgia was another such anomaly, so rare and unusual that to this day, Donald Trump refuses to accept that it happened.
Raphael Warnock’s victory in a special election runoff in 2021, making him the first Black Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate from the South, was also an anomaly, as was Sen. Jon Ossoff’s runoff win that year. Georgia hadn’t had a Democratic senator in almost 20 years, but suddenly we had two in the same year, so surely that too was just a fluke, the result of a rare confluence of political events at the national level that is unlikely to be repeated here in Georgia.
Of course, Warnock then won re-election in 2022. Was that too just an anomaly, a one-time event explained away by the GOP’s mistake in running Herschel Walker, a man who made his name on the football field, as its candidate? It’s not as if Georgia Republicans would ever repeat that unforced error, right? They would never again try to nominate someone else whose only qualification was football fame, someone like Derek Dooley?
No, they would never.
But anomalies are funny things. Considered in isolation, they might not mean much. But when you get a string of them, one anomaly after another, they cease to be anomalies at all. They become a trend.
We also have other anomalies to consider. For example, today we have a former Republican lieutenant governor who has switched parties and is now running for governor as a Democrat. That’s pretty rare, right? When was the last time a party-switcher actually ran for governor and won? 
 Well, Sonny Perdue did it in 2002. That was an anomaly, until Nathan Deal did it again in 2010. The anomalies became a trend.
We also have MAGA queen Marjorie Taylor Greene, representing Georgia’s 14th Congressional District, who is suddenly and loudly condemning her own party’s leadership. She is slamming it for its failure to reopen the government and for its failure to address a looming crisis in health insurance affordability. In a startling appearance this week on The View, where Greene was greeted warmly by the liberal hosts, she called the GOP’s performance “embarrassing.”
My mother, who lives out of state, is a big fan of The View. 
“What the heck happened to that woman?” Mom asked me this week. “Did she get struck by lightning or something?”
“No, Mom. I think it was space lasers. Or maybe chemtrails.”
The easy, short-term conclusion from all this is that Democrats have momentum going into the 2026 midterms, both here in Georgia and nationwide. While I think that’s true, something deeper and more profound is also going on. 
A generation is finally ceding power that it has clung to for too long, necessary because we face new problems that our elders do not comprehend. The political establishments of both parties are crumbling, and frustration with government has become so profound that Americans of all ideologies find themselves open to solutions that previous generations had rejected. In a recent YouGov poll, for example, just 13% of Americans said they approved of how Congress is performing, and that’s just not sustainable. Change is coming, and fast.
What we see happening in Georgia, then, is just a small part of what’s happening nationally, globally. Coalitions are breaking apart, and new ones will be forming. Old ways of understanding are being tossed aside. As structures and systems are torn down, new ones must rise to replace them. 
Trump and MAGA offer one such alternative, one they apparently intend to impose by force if necessary. Tuesday’s results offer us hope that other alternatives will emerge and prove more viable, but in a world where everything seems an anomaly, who the hell knows.

(Photo by Amanda Hernández/Stateline)The Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services is finalizing regulations to classify a “dangerous” derivative of kratom as a Schedule I narcotic that would make it a crime to sell, possess or distribute the substance. 
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear in a Wednesday press conference said 7-hydroxymitragynine, or 7-OH, is a “powerful and addictive drug that has no place in Kentucky.” A press release from his office stated law enforcement would be able to remove the “unsafe” 7-OH products from shelves once the regulation is finalized. 
“Because of this action, law enforcement and regulatory agencies can get this drug out of communities,” Beshear said. 
7-OH is found naturally in very low levels in the leaves of a kratom plant, though concentration of the chemical compound increases when the leaves are dried and processed. Products containing isolated, concentrated versions of 7-OH have been sold as tablets, gummies, drink mixes and shots. 
Those 7-OH products are distinct from kratom products — controversial herbal supplements used for pain relief, anxiety and opioid withdrawal symptoms — that are generally sold from retailers including smoke and vape shops. The Kentucky legislature passed a law, signed by Beshear, last year to regulate kratom and prohibit its sale to individuals under the age of 21. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July recommended certain 7-OH products be controlled because of the “potential for abuse because of its ability to bind to opioid receptors.” Researchers have said more study is needed of both kratom and 7-OH to understand their long-term effects.
Mac Haddow, a senior fellow on public policy for the nonprofit American Kratom Association, told the Lantern manufacturers selling concentrated 7-OH products have erroneously labeled the products as “kratom” to make it easier to sell. 
“They know that there’s an advantage to calling it kratom because you’ve got millions of consumers who regularly use kratom, and they want to dupe them into buying their product and get them hooked on it,” Haddow said. “Unfortunately, the addiction profile of 7-OH is very high compared to kratom.” 
Haddow said his association supports the Beshear administration’s move to restrict access to 7-OH products but warned manufacturers of 7-OH have used other chemical processes to create new, separate compounds derived from 7-OH to sidestep bans.
He said his association plans to recommend to Kentucky health officials that a state regulation also ban all synthetics derived from 7-OH. 
“That way you get rid of these games that these manufacturers are playing,” Haddow said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kratom-1.jpg,,,2025-11-06 05:16:32.402784

The poll, released Thursday, was conducted by YouGov and commissioned by the Regional Plan Association, a research and advocacy group focused on land use and transit policy. YouGov surveyed more than 800 Connecticut residents across the political spectrum, asking them about specific policies included in the sweeping housing bill vetoed over the summer, House Bill 5002.
The poll showed that 42% of respondents said housing was the most important issue facing Connecticut. Forty percent said taxes were most important, and 27% said inflation.
The survey also found that respondents generally supported most of the major policies included in H.B. 5002, including turning vacant buildings into housing, boosting the amount of housing near transit, requiring towns and cities to allow more homes and easing parking requirements.
“The average voter can be counted on to be relatively reasonable on recognizing how important affordable housing is, how much of a lack there is,” said Pete Harrison, Connecticut director of the Regional Plan Association. “I think there’s a pretty clear correlation that people want the governor to step up and do more because they don’t trust towns to do it.”
Desegregate Connecticut, a program of the RPA, lobbied for a portion of H.B. 5002 that would have pushed towns to allow more housing near train and bus rapid transit stations.
Harrison said he thinks the results show that housing can be a winning platform for candidates. All of the mayors who attended his organization’s housing conference, YIMBYtown, held onto their seats in Tuesday’s election, he said.
H.B. 5002 passed with narrow margins in the House and Senate during the last legislative session. It addressed myriad issues, including homelessness, zoning and housing production. Gov. Ned Lamont vetoed the measure over the summer saying he wanted to see more buy in from local officials.
The General Assembly is expected to convene a special session next week, and key lawmakers say they’re close to a deal with the governor’s office on a new version of the housing bill.
“The Governor is committed to working on a revised housing bill and collaborating with state and local leaders on both sides of the aisle. Plans are underway to unveil that bill ahead of next week’s special legislative session where it will be taken up for a vote by the General Assembly,” said Rob Blanchard, the governor’s spokesman, in a statement.
Questions in the poll directly addressed many specific components of H.B. 5002.
The poll showed that turning vacant buildings into housing was one of the most popular proposals in H.B. 5002 with 86% of respondents saying they somewhat or strongly supported it. The bill specifically would have allowed for more conversions of commercial properties into residential.
Just over 70% of respondents said they supported a policy that would allow more housing near transit. H.B. 5002 would have prioritized certain state infrastructure funding for towns that allow more housing density near public transit.
About 70% also said they supported policies that require towns and cities to allow more housing. The bill had a measure known as “fair share” that would have divided regional housing need between towns and assigned each town a number of units to plan and zone for.
Just over half of those surveyed said they supported policies that allow developers to be more flexible with how much parking they put at buildings. The bill would have removed requirements to build off-street parking for certain smaller apartment buildings.
That support expressed by respondents fell across party lines — although respondents who identified as Democrats tended to be the most supportive. Respondents in urban, suburban and rural parts of the state all expressed some degree of support for the policy proposals, with most coming from cities.
Among lawmakers, however, the components of H.B. 5002 faced pushback from both sides of the aisle. Opponents feared it would dilute local control and put onerous requirements on towns. They also said each solution might not work for every town because they all have unique needs.
Most respondents to the survey said building more housing was more important to them than local control.
House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said he often hears from constituents that the cost of housing is too high. He said be thinks  the proposals in the bill weren’t as controversial among average Connecticut residents as they seemed during the legislative session.
“For the average person out there, they’re really concerned about housing, either for their adult children, or for young professionals or for elderly parents, or for just the regular person,” Rojas said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20230123_DesegregateCT_WHartford_YK_095-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-06 05:16:32.402784

The head of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio said the crush of federal funding cuts combined with the loss of Medicaid patients impacted the affiliate so much that a “right-sizing” of staff is necessary.
Erica Wilson-Domer, president and CEO of the Greater Ohio branch, said its 12 family planning centers, two ambulatory surgical centers, and the virtual health center will all stay open, but 14 to 15 positions overall are set to be cut.
“We kind of held on as long as we could while we could see Medicaid patients,” Wilson-Domer told the Capital Journal.
“There are just places now where it doesn’t make sense to keep the staffing level where it was.”
Some of the affiliate’s larger centers, like Columbus-area locations, would have one clinician and support staff as a result of the cuts, instead of the two clinicians they currently have.
Staff and management were notified on Tuesday of the planned workforce cuts.
The organization’s CEO said it had also reduced administration expenses at the highest levels of the group by $2 million over the last two years, through management consolidation and reductions.
“We’ve gotten as lean as we can possibly go,” Wilson-Domer said.
The full details of the new staffing cuts are still pending, now that Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio’s workers are unionized with the Office and Professional Employees International Union.
Negotiations with the union will take place before the cuts are made, though a timeline on the negotiation process is not clear at this point.
A representative for the group’s union confirmed it was notified of the planned staff cuts on Tuesday.
“As always, we are disappointed by any actions that reduce PPGOH’s workforce and plan to immediately enter into effects bargaining to try and reduce the impact on staff and patient care,” the union said in a statement to the Capital Journal.
This is the second time the Greater Ohio affiliate has had to make staffing cuts attributed to the federal funding woes.
The affiliate, along with Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio, is also in the middle of appealing a letter from the Ohio Department of Medicaid that proposes terminating its state Medicaid funds, based on the cuts made at the federal level.
Wilson-Domer said Medicaid patients made up 40% of the population who used Greater Ohio’s services, so the cuts that came from federal bans on Medicaid dollars going to Planned Parenthoods across the country led to a significant drop in patient volume.
Medicaid funds have long been prohibited from use in abortion care, and clinic leaders in the state have maintained that no Medicaid funds have been used for abortion services.
The inability for Medicaid patients to be treated at Planned Parenthoods will impact primary care for those low-income Ohioans who lack access or ability to get to other medical facilities.
That includes services such as regular health screenings, tests for sexually transmitted diseases, and contraceptive care.
“Really what (the funding loss) is hurting is those preventative services that keep communities healthy,” Wilson-Domer said. “The reality is there are places where people don’t have options.”
Since President Trump took office the second time, PPGOH has lost $10 million in funding, according to affiliate data.
That includes $2 million in Title X funding, a pot of federal money that goes to facilities who provide “family planning and preventive health services,” according to the federal Office of Population Affairs, who distributes Title X grants.
“Family planning includes a broad range of services related to achieving pregnancy, preventing pregnancy and assisting women, men and couples with achieving their desired number and spacing of children,” the office stated on their website.
As of Tuesday, the Office of Population Affairs listed 12 “family planning clinics” who receive Title X funding in Ohio, half of which are city or county health departments.
The closest clinic listed for a resident living in Cleveland would be the Morrow County Health Department in Mount Gilead or the Kno-Ho-Co family planning facility in Mount Vernon, a trek that could be more than 100 miles either way.
Someone in Athens would have to travel about 35 miles to get to the closest clinic listed for them, Family Health Services of East Central Ohio in New Lexington.
Those who have private insurance and can use the organization’s self-pay options are still able to access care through Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio.
The organization can also help give referrals to Medicaid patients for eligible providers, like Federally Qualified Health Centers.

Republish photo only with original article.)Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose sent more than 1,000 cases of alleged voter fraud to the U.S. Department of Justice.
Critics contend, as LaRose himself has, that enforcing election laws is best handled at the state and local level.
Going shopping
Since taking office, LaRose has regularly announced the number of alleged election law violations his office has found.
In nearly all cases, those allegations have proven meritless.
After reviewing more than 600 cases, for instance, Ohio’s Republican Attorney General Dave Yost brought just six charges.
At the time, Yost grumbled about how many of those referrals were for illegal registration.
“I think that we ought to be focusing on the voting,” he said, rather than sidelining violent criminal investigations to check paperwork.
And Yost’s review amounted to a second opinion.
LaRose had previously referred those cases to county prosecutors.
They largely found there wasn’t enough evidence to bring cases.
Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association Executive Director Lou Tobin called LaRose’s actions an attack on prosecutors.
With the U.S. Department of Justice referral, LaRose is again going back to the well, touting an administration “that has expressed an interest in actively reviewing and potentially prosecuting” election crimes.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Yost and Tobin declined to comment for this story, but a measure in the Ohio Senate is illuminating.
In the most recent budget, Gov. Mike DeWine vetoed a provision allowing the Secretary of State to re-refer election law cases to the attorney general if the county prosecutor doesn’t bring charges within a year.
That idea came from Senate Bill 4, which has passed the Senate and is now moving through the Ohio House.
In testimony against the bill, Tobin criticized its codification of “forum shopping.”
When a prosecutor declines to pursue a case, he said, the matter should end.
“If a prosecutor decides that a case should not or cannot be prosecuted for whatever reason, the secretary of state can make the referral to the attorney general and hope for a different outcome,” Tobin wrote.
“This is forum shopping, and it undermines the integrity and legitimacy of our justice system.”
LaRose’s referrals
In a press release, LaRose emphasizes the “more than 1,200 criminal cases” he’s sent to federal prosecutors.
The secretary did not respond to Ohio Capital Journal’s request for an interview or comment.
Of LaRose’s referrals, about 1,000 appear to be instances of illegal registration alone.
LaRose notes only 167 examples of noncitizens allegedly casting a ballot spread over the last eight years of four federal elections.
Ohioans cast almost 27.5 million ballots in those elections.
Even if every single one of LaRose’s allegations proves true, that’s a rate of .0006%.
LaRose also cites 99 cases of people allegedly voting in two states in the same election, 16 of people allegedly voting twice in Ohio, and 14 of people allegedly voting after their death.
Additionally, LaRose referred four cases of alleged ballot harvesting and two more of people registering at an improper residence.
“We work tirelessly to ensure that every eligible voter’s voice is heard,” LaRose said in the press release, “and anyone who tries to cheat the system will face serious consequences.”
LaRose is not wrong.
In addition to the charges brought by Yost late last year, in 2023, a Shaker Heights Trump supporter named James Saunders was convicted of voting in Ohio and Florida in at least two elections.
But LaRose contends his referrals “have encountered varying degrees of adjudication from Ohio’s 88 county prosecutors,” and he’d like the U.S. Department of Justice to have another look.
“I formally refer for your consideration the materials we have gathered and submitted to local and state prosecutors,” he wrote, “and I have included with this letter documentation and evidentiary materials regarding each of the alleged offenses.”
Red flags
Ohio was able to nab Saunders thanks to a multistate data sharing agreement known as ERIC.
Joining a handful of other Republican-led states, LaRose pulled Ohio out of the compact in 2023.
He complained states should be allowed to use the data without having to encourage voter registration — a core part of ERIC’s mission.
David Becker helped establish ERIC but now runs the Center for Election Innovation and Research.
He criticized LaRose for trotting out years-old evidence that has already been reviewed by state and local prosecutors.
Becker added that, in some instances, flagged registrations got processed despite an individual identifying themselves as a noncitizen, “meaning that they are, in fact, victims, not criminals.”
“To wait over a year,” Becker said, “and publicly submit this stale evidence to the Trump DOJ, immediately before elections that are happening in many states, certainly raises questions.”
And LaRose has argued in the past that federal officials should stay out of election oversight.
Early in the Biden administration, Democrats proposed a sweeping elections and ethics measure that would have made simplified voter registration, reformed redistricting, and strengthened campaign finance laws.
LaRose rejected the idea as a “massive power-grab.”
“Elections belong to the people and are regulated by their representatives at the state level,” LaRose said after a scaled back version of the proposal failed in the U.S. Senate.
“Washington bureaucrats have a long and storied tradition of messing up the most revered of institutions — we won’t let them do that to Ohio’s elections.”
Case Western Reserve University law professor Atiba Ellis sees LaRose scrapping those arguments about federalism now that the political winds have shifted.
To Ellis, it seems like LaRose is working backward from the Trump administration’s prioritization of immigration enforcement in hopes of finding a more receptive audience for his voter fraud claims.
Particularly in Ohio, there have been political conversations “some factual, some fanciful,” about the impact of illegal immigrants in our communities.
“Certainly, this would score political points for the people who believe in that narrative,” Ellis said of LaRose’s referrals.
Ellis also pointed to a recent court ruling rejecting a Trump executive order requiring proof of citizenship.
“This court seemed to rule, correctly, that the basic constitutional structure does not put policing elections within the purview of the executive office,” Ellis said.
It’s “dubious,” he said, for LaRose to attempt an end run around elected state and local prosecutors.
“Trying to make a state issue a federal issue in order to pursue political agendas ought to raise concern about the discretion that is being used by the Secretary of State,” Ellis said. “Given that state authorities, who are duly sworn to prosecute these issues, have declined to prosecute most of them, and appear to have done so on a reasonable basis.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)In the end, Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins just couldn’t get it done.
Hawkins didn’t have the muscle, didn’t have the persuasive power, didn’t have the juice to deliver for President Donald Trump. All the president asked was for a simple redistricting, a tiny gerrymander in Johnson County, to deliver an extra congressional seat to Republicans. All Hawkins had to do was persuade two-thirds of his chamber to sign a petition calling for a special session. Too many Republicans balked.
Trump groups people into two camps: winners and losers. Hawkins showed, on the same day that Democrats romped to victory in other states, that he was a loser.
But then Trump may have been distracted on Tuesday. The appearance-obsessed president was arguably the biggest loser of all that day, as voters from California to New York City rejected his strongman approach to governing. Democrats didn’t just score victories in governors’ races and statehouses — they won by commanding margins.
Perhaps Hawkins hoped the national news cycle would obscure his fumble. No such luck.
Don’t let Republican leaders fool you, either. Hawkins and Senate President Ty Masterson have claimed that gerrymandering would be a top priority in 2026, but everyone knows the score. If you can’t gain a two-thirds majority of House members to call the special session, you’re unlikely to get a two-thirds majority of House members to support new maps in the regular session. Leaders might push ahead, forcing their rank and file on the record, but count me skeptical that a new map results.
Let’s call this proposed special session what it was: a waste of time, energy and money meant to serve one man’s ravening ego. MAGA-adjacent GOP officials grasped and clawed for attention from their withholding father figure in Washington, D.C. They ended up making themselves look ridiculous in front of a national audience.
We know Hawkins lost, but who ended up winning?
U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, for one. Good ole’ “Doc” won’t have to face U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids next year. She was publicly flirting with making a Senate run if redistricted out of her seat. I suspect Marshall was less than eager to campaign against the popular Democrat.
Masterson, for another. He escaped the worst blame by pushing his chamber on board last month. His nascent gubernatorial campaign can double down on claims that he’s an effective leader. If only that pesky House speaker hadn’t fallen down on the job.
The national results from Tuesday surely weigh on leaders’ considerations as well. Kansas has elected Democrats to the U.S. House throughout the decades, and diluting Republican majorities in some districts to potentially swing others could lead to unexpected consequences.
“Trying to win more seats comes with a risk, because in order to win more seats, they have to draw districts more competitively,” University of Texas at Dallas professor Thomas Brunell told the Associated Press.
In smaller states, “you have fewer lines; you’re not going to be able to put them as far out of reach without creating opportunities elsewhere,” wonderfully named University of Chicago professor Moon Duchin added. “And so, yes, you have to do it really carefully because it can backfire.”
Two Democratic U.S. representatives? It’s happened before.
The real winners in all this are everyday Kansans. They’re the ones who don’t have to see their votes further diluted at the ballot box. Residents of Johnson County must feel relieved knowing they won’t be sliced and diced into two — or three — districts. Transgender Kansans, too, can rest for a least a couple more months without Republicans targeting their ability to change their gender markers on driver’s licenses.
Finally, the state treasury should see a reprieve. Nearly a half-million dollars had been budgeted for a prospective special session beginning Friday. That $460,000 will remain unspent for now.
Who knows? Legislators could use it to feed some hungry people.

Crews will administer millions of pounds of force to the piles to test their ability to support a new bridge. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Construction crews are beginning to drive massive cylindrical piles into the Patapsco riverbed, part of the next stage of the expedited rebuilding Baltimore’s fallen Francis Scott Key Bridge.
If everything goes right, some of these steel piles could later form part of the new Key Bridge, engineers said. But mainly, they are test subjects.
Once the piles are positioned deep within the river bottom, crews will top them with a large yellow cap that functions as a hammer, striking the pile repeatedly to test its strength. Eventually, the blows will reach a maximum force of about 10 million pounds, said Brian Wolfe, the director of project development at the Maryland Transportation Authority.
“We know the piles can carry the load, just based on steel being a known material. What’s unknown is that river bottom,” Wolfe said. “This is to verify: How far down do we need to drive those piles into it, in order to get the load that we need to carry the bridge?
Jim Harkness, right, chief engineer at the Maryland Transportation Authority, and MdTA Director of Project Development Brian Wolfe, speak Wednesday at the Francis Scott Key Bridge site. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)
During a sampling effort in the Patapsco River, engineers discovered that a substantial upper layer of the riverbed, the first 60 or 70 feet, is “soupy,” Wolfe said. In other words, it is much too soft to support an enormous cable-stayed bridge.
But beneath all of that muck is an “extremely hard” layer, Wolfe said, and the piles will need to burrow deep into that layer in order to hold up the bridge.
Each pile is more than 200 feet long and 8 feet in diameter, and weighs around 340,000 pounds, Wolfe said. So, maneuvering them requires some of the East Coast’s largest cranes, as have several other parts of the complex effort to demolish the old bridge and bring in the new.
Already, six piles have been placed in the Patapsco River, and crews are busy cutting excess, rusty steel from the top of each piece, leaving behind sections that have been coated to prevent water intrusion and degradation, said Jason Stolicny, deputy director of project development at the MdTA. Next, a steel frame will be placed on the piles as they are carefully monitored during testing to see how they withstand the hammer blows.
Still, reminders of the terrifying crash more than a year and a half ago remain on the site, including a large concrete pier, now surrounded by barges, cranes and construction equipment.

On March 26, 2024, a cargo ship bound for Sri Lanka, carrying more than 4,600 shipping containers, struck one of the bridge’s support columns after a mechanical failure on the ship, sending the structure careening into the water, and killing six construction workers who had been working on the roadway above.
Even though work is underway on the new bridge, which has a target completion date of fall 2028, crews are still removing large pieces of the old one. That demolition work is roughly halfway complete, engineers say, and is expected to continue through early 2026.
Currently, crews are focused on removing the remaining bridge spans that run over the land, Stolicny said. That’s because they hope to erect a “temporary access trestle,” Stolicny said, essentially a pedestrian bridge that will allow workers to easily reach the bridge site on the river.
Initial projections placed the cost for the bridge replacement around $1.8 billion, with a 2028 reopening date. But the MdTA’s chief engineer Jim Harkness was less than certain about the completion date Wednesday, saying that his  team is still working with its contractors to determine the project schedule and estimate.
But Harkness added that fall 2028 is still the target, and that the authority is moving at “breakneck speed” to get the new bridge built.
An official groundbreaking is likely in the next few months, said Harkness, who noted that the new bridge will have rigid fenders, added with the intent to protect the piers from potential ship strikes.
The authority’s contractor, Kiewit Corp., is about 70% finished designing the new cable-stayed bridge, Harkness said, with an expected completion date at the end of this month. The design work started last September, Harkness said.
“We’re expecting to have 2,000 plan sheets make up the design for this bridge. If you printed all that out, you’d have a stack of paper nearly 8 inches tall,” Harkness said. “Something that would normally take a team years, we’ve been able to accomplish in 14 months.”

One potential hurdle that has cropped up in recent months is the federal government, which pledged in the Biden administration to fully fund a Key Bridge replacement. But President Donald Trump has hinted that his administration may not do that, although state leaders note that the funding agreement was written into law.
In a September letter to state officials, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that “any reliance on race- or sex-conscious factors in contracting decisions could introduce significant legal vulnerabilities and inefficiencies in the management of the project,” an apparent reference to state programs to bolster minority and women-owned businesses in contracting efforts.
Kiewit, the bridge contractor, has committed previously to a goal of using 26% “disadvantaged business enterprises,” including businesses that are at least 51% owned and controlled by one or more minority individuals.
Duffy also said his department hopes to ensure that the project is delivered “on time, on budget, and in compliance with the law.”
“We will continue to work with the Trump Administration to find ways to reduce costs and rebuild faster,” Gov. Wes Moore (D) said in a statement responding to Duffy’s letter. “We anticipate the price estimation process to be finalized in the coming months and we will provide regular updates.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
As work continues with the piles, crews will employ a technology called a “bubble curtain” to soften underwater noise from the hammer blows, minimizing impacts to fish and other creatures in the river, officials say. Using air compressors on a barge at the site, crews create Jacuzzi-like bubbles around the piles, capable of dampening sound.
Weeks worth of data from the hammer blows will determine whether the new bridge’s foundation is strong, and construction can proceed apace, Wolfe said. So far, the pile installation has gone as planned, he said, matching the crew’s expectations about the sediment at the bottom of the river.
“It’s essentially confirming what we had anticipated from the boring program,” Wolfe said. “[The piles] went through that soupy material right to that hard layer, like we had anticipated.”

Birds are actually pretty smart – think about how far they migrate without any access to maps or GPS! I think the people who like birds are pretty smart too.
Exhibit A of my argument would be what the Sarasota Audubon Society has accomplished in defending a bird sanctuary called the Celery Fields. A piece of property next door was targeted for development by the nation’s largest homebuilder, D.R. Horton, but the Audubon folks didn’t chicken out. They took them on and won.

“Sarasota County again rejects D.R. Horton development near Celery Fields,” the Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported last week.
The decision wasn’t even close, either – a 5-0 vote by the commissioners to tell the big homebuilder to go home.
I was so intrigued by what happened that I contacted the Sarasota Audubon folks. I wound up talking to their president and their attorney.
Susan Schoettle (Photo via screen grab)
“I saw this as the wrong development on the wrong piece of land in the wrong place,” the attorney, Susan Schoettle, told me.
The president, Sara Reisinger, explained their success even more concisely.
“This property floods,” she told me. “After (Hurricane) Debby, it was under 3 feet of water.”
Still, getting a Florida government agency to reject a major homebuilder is what the ornithologists would call “a rara avis.”

 Suckered in Sarasota

Many Florida towns have oddball origin stories. The Panhandle hamlet of Two Egg got its name from a local store where the poor residents bartered for goods. Central Florida’s Nalcrest was built by retired postal workers from the National Association of Letter Carriers. Sweetwater in South Florida was populated by a troupe of Russian circus midgets. Sarasota was settled by a bunch of Scotsmen who got suckered into buying lots in a town that hadn’t been built yet.
“When the steamer ship that brought them to Florida arrived at its destination in 1885, “the colonists gathered to see their new home but could not find it,” the Sarasota History Alive website reports. “There was not a sign of a town anywhere up or down the coast. It was then that the colonists found out that the Town of Sarasota just existed on a map.”
By the mid-1900s, Sarasota really WAS on the map. It became nationally known as the winter quarters of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus. The Oscar-winning 1952 circus movie “The Greatest Show on Earth,” starring Charlton Heston and Jimmy Stewart, was filmed there.
Sarasota has come a long way since those days. It’s now known for its culture and sophistication, with opera, ballet and multiple theater companies. In Sarasota, the circus is now confined to the Ringling Museum and the occasional political shenanigan.
Sarasota has plenty of environmental attractions, too, from acclaimed Siesta Beach to majestic Myakka River State Park.
And that includes the Celery Fields.
 Swamp to celery to swamp again
Sarasota’s most influential early resident was Bertha Palmer, wife of millionaire Potter Palmer and the woman many called “the Queen of Chicago.”
When she bought more than 100,000 acres of land in Florida in the early 1900s, she had lots of ideas about turning swamps into farms – including one parcel for growing celery.
In 1995, though, Sarasota County bought the Celery Fields with an eye toward a different use for the land: turning it back into a swamp. The county acquired the 400-acre parcel “primarily for stormwater management purposes to intercept and store upstream runoff from the largely undeveloped watersheds north and east during extremely heavy rain events, thereby to prevent downstream flooding,” former Sarasota County administrator John Wesley White told me.

Then someone hatched the notion that the Celery Fields could also be for the birds both local and migratory.
“The idea of the Celery Fields becoming a bird rookery and nature park only occurred after we started excavating the site to create more storage capacity,” White added. “It has become a popular draw for those purposes.”
County officials worked with Audubon to restore about 100 acres to resemble the wetlands that existed before Mrs. Palmer came along. The property is edged by oaks, willows, and pines, and the county built a pair of boardwalks to accommodate visitors. Audubon has counted more than 240 kinds of birds that use the site originally intended just for stormwater.
“It’s an incredible example of a dual-purpose facility,” Reisinger told me.
Sarasota Audubon folks love the Celery Fields so much they built their $1 million nature center there. You could say they’ve nested there. The nature center is open from October to May to accommodate Sarasota’s snowbirds.
The staff and volunteers hold regularly scheduled hikes. It’s become a major eco-tourist destination, attracting 130,000 visitors a year from all over the world.
But then D.R. Horton swooped in, ready to ruin things by building a bunch of houses next door.
 Strike one
Builders are having a tough time these days. They’re reeling from a presidential one-two punch: his tariffs on steel, copper and lumber has driven up the costs of building materials, and his crackdown on immigration has chased away lots of their employees.
Nevertheless, D.R. Horton marched into a Sarasota County planning and zoning meeting a year ago with big plans, seeking to rezone a 50-acre ranch.
They wanted to change it from “open use rural,” which allows one unit per 10 acres, to “residential single family,” which allows 3.5 units per acre. That way they could build 170 houses.
More than 100 people flocked to the meeting, a crowd that the Herald-Tribune described as “mostly middle-aged and older residents, fed up with what they see as rampant over development.”
The developers’ land-use attorney, Charles “Charlie” Bailey III, crowed that the Horton project would create more wildlife habitat than what was on the existing ranchland. Feel free to roll your eyes about that claim. I sure did.

He also pointed out that the developers had met with Sarasota Audubon officials to discuss their objections to the project. Reisinger confirmed that such a meeting happened. But she also said that Audubon’s objections didn’t suddenly fly away because of the meeting.
“We were very adamant right from the beginning that this was not a suitable site for development,” Reisinger told me.
While the county’s land-use plan would allow this kind of project to be built, Schoettle told me, it fails to meet a major condition included in county rules.
“The development has to be compatible with the adjacent land uses,” Schoettle explained. “D.R. Horton knew when they entered into a contract to buy the land that it was next to the Celery Fields bird sanctuary.”
In the end, the planning and zoning committee agreed. They voted 4-3 to tell commissioners to keep the zoning the way it was, no matter what D.R. Horton wanted.
In February, the developers tried again.
 Strike two
This time, they attempted to egg the county commissioners on to reject the committee’s recommendation. Bailey characterized their prior defeat as the developer having “received some meaningful feedback,” which I think belongs in the Putting a Positive Spin on Bad News Hall of Fame.
Now D.R. Horton wanted to build 126 units. The project was the same turkey, just smaller.
“We hope that you’ll see the great effort that D.R. Horton went into to ensure that this property is done the right way,” Bailey said.
Five hours of comments followed, with 61 speakers ranging from a 9-year-old girl to a 90-year-old retiree. I watched the video. Not a single person piped up in favor of D.R. Horton’s Plans.
People talked about everything from the impacts on the Celery Fields’ nesting and migratory habitat, to the economic impact of losing such an important eco-tourism site, to D.R. Horton’s horrible national reputation for building bad homes.

Plenty of bird fans squawked about the dire consequences of approving the rezoning. But the lineup of opponents recruited by Sarasota Audubon also included a stormwater expert, a landscape architect and even an urban planner, all of whom talked in detail about how inappropriate this development would be on that site.
One of the speakers, retired New College environmental science instructor Jono Miller, pointed out that the property was listed as flood-prone by both the state and federal government.
He questioned where the water from Hurricane Debby would have gone if Horton had already built its 126 houses there.
The county commissioners, after a brief discussion, voted Horton’s rezoning request down 5-0.
Their two defeats led D.R. Horton to take an unorthodox step.

Strike three
This time, the company was the one that squawked. It filed a complaint through the Florida Land Use and Environmental Dispute Resolution Act. It’s designed to provide a speedier resolution than just suing.
The act allows property owners to seek arbitration if they feel a local development decision “unreasonable or unfairly burdens” them. That arbitration effort brought them back before the commission last week with a brand-new proposal.
Now, Bailey told the commissioners, D.R. Horton wanted permission to build a mere 85 homes on that soggy property.
Bailey promised there would be no streetlights to spook the birds. And he said his clients would install flood protection measures that would be more stringent than what the county usually required.
The bird fans came loaded for bear.
“This would be our only opportunity to talk to the board about their decision, so we showed up with 10 people who spoke for three minutes each,’ Schoettle told me. “We reminded them why this was a bad idea and they should reject it. They did.”
The commissioners’ 5-0 vote marked a third strike for the mighty Horton, which went down swinging just like “Casey at the Bat.”
The reason was simple, one commissioner said: “I mean, this is a flood plain.”
 Next step
Reisinger told me Audubon’s triple victories were “shocking.” She’s right.
But they’re also instructive for anyone going through something similar. If you’re trying to preserve your slice of Florida paradise from the runaway growth that’s wrecking a lot of special places around the state, then you need to imitate the Sarasota folks like you’re a mockingbird. 
The lessons are: Be organized, know how land-use law works, keep your emotions in check as you focus on your goal, present photos showing the downside of the development and use subject-matter experts to testify.
Property rights are fine, but “there is no right to a rezoning,” Schoettle reminded me.
I asked Miller why the Sarasota commissioners – each one a self-described fan of property rights — were uniformly opposed to D.R. Horton’s rezoning.
“Our latest county commission is generally more willing to say no than the previous version,” he told me (so remember that come election time). He also said it’s a sign of the “general awareness that citizens have had it with growth.”
He also credited “better than average organizing” by the Audubon opponents, using “dramatic images” of the site being flooded last year.
Although the Sarasota Audubon folks have won three times, they’re under no illusion that they have triumphed permanently. Like a mama bird preparing to fight off a persistent predator, they’re ready for rounds four, five and six.
But they have come up with a possible solution, one that would allow the current owner of the property to get a profit from selling it.
Just not to D.R. Horton.
“We’d like to see the county purchase it,” Schoettle told me. “It would be a useful addition to the Celery Fields.”
Wouldn’t that be a wonderful conclusion to this birdbrained story? I hope it happens. For the Audubon folks, that would be a real feather in their caps.

(Photo by David Espejo/Stock photo via Getty Images)Nearly all Marylanders responding to a new poll said they are aware of artificial intelligence — and they have concerns.
“There’s, like, across the board concern,” said Mileah Kromer, director of the poll produced for the Institute of Politics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. “Democrats, Republicans, unaffiliated voters, so everybody’s pretty concerned about this.”
Kromer’s poll, released Thursday, found that 54% of those surveyed said they had heard or read “a lot” about AI. Another 32% said they knew “some” and 11% “just a little.”
Those who were at least “a little” familiar with the technology said they think it will have a negative impact on society. Three in 10 voters said they believe AI will have a positive impact.
“They are aware and they are wary,” Kromer said.
Poll: Nearly half of voters back Moore as field of challengers continues to develop

Not wary enough to swear off AI entirely, however: Despite the concerns, more than 70% of those surveyed said they are using the technology at lease occasionally.
About 43% said they used AI tools weekly if not more often. Another 9% said they used it multiple times a month. One in five said they used the technology less than once a month while 26% said they never use it.
The UMBC poll surveyed 810 Maryland adults, who included 757 registered voters. The poll, conducted Oct. 21-25, has an overall margin of error of 3.4%. The margin of error among registered voters is 3.5%.
The poll released Thursday is the third of the poll’s three surveys.
Concerns in the most recent poll include:

81% are concerned about the spread of misinformation and political propaganda because of AI.
78% said identity theft and impersonation are a concern.
61% said the impact on education and critical thinking skills.
58% said the decline of interpersonal interactions and relationships.
55% said they worried it would displace people in the workplace.
51% worried about the impact of data centers on the environment.
Just 44% worried about law enforcement using the tool for facial recognition.

“Everybody’s concerned,” Kromer said. “And I think that the interesting story from a political perspective, is the concern about the spread of misinformation and political propaganda, and the concern about identity theft or impersonation and manipulation of images, video or audio.”

For a university already grappling with state funding cuts, federal grant rescissions, and the dismantling of DEI efforts, the price of parking has become a university-wide symbol of inequity and frustration.
Nearly all UConn commuters pay to park on campus. Of the roughly one-third of UConn students who do not live on-site, attending classes and joining clubs requires an up-front, out-of-pocket parking permit costing from $365 to $1,098 a year, with even higher rates for premium lots. Faculty and staff, too, must pay to park at their workplace — although they may spread the cost through payroll deductions, a luxury students do not receive. For non-traditional students already juggling responsibilities, the economic and emotional costs of parking are a significant barrier to their access and success.
Those who cannot afford permits are relegated to time-limited street parking or must wait until evening to access certain on-campus lots. Most park on the periphery of campus and endure extensive walks or rely on shuttle services that are, at best, inconsistent. Enforcement is punitive and costly, with a minimum fine of $40 and policies allowing the booting of cars. Unlike tuition, fees, housing, meals, and even books, the cost of a permit does not appear on the semester fee bill and cannot be covered by financial aid packages or payment plans. As such, commuters must find a way to produce hundreds of dollars before the first day of classes or risk a back-breaking ticket.
The economic costs extend well beyond permits and citations. Commuters spend thousands of dollars annually on gas, insurance, car payments, and maintenance. Since none of these expenses can be standardized, they are seldom accurately measured in financial aid calculations, further widening cost gaps for marginalized students. At UConn, roughly a third of the incoming class will attend a commuter-centered regional campus, where students are significantly more likely to be first-generation compared to those at the residential Storrs campus. For them, parking is not a convenience but a necessity — yet the system charges them extra for equal access to the same university community.
The cost of parking is not only economic but emotional, as it erodes dignity and belonging. Permits and citations send the message that you do not belong at UConn unless you can afford to. Instead of focusing on academics or student life, commuters burn emotional capital struggling to find parking, getting a ticket, or being booted. Arriving late to class because the shuttle was behind or skipping an event because the parking fee is too steep reinforces the outsider and peripheral status of vulnerable students, both literally and figuratively.
Graduate assistants, adjuncts, and employees working on tight budgets are also forced to pay hundreds just to access the job they are already underpaid to perform. Parking policies, once logistical necessities, have become symbols of misplaced priorities: for a university that publicly champions inclusion, this misalignment should no longer be tolerated.
Proponents of the UConn parking system argue that it is an important revenue source and that it discourages delinquent parking. While the system generates $6 million annually — including more than $1 million from student citations alone — it is funded disproportionately by non-traditional, at-risk students. Meanwhile, delinquent parking has not decreased despite rising fines. Students park without paying not because they want to, but because they cannot afford to.
With waning support for equity-oriented programs at the federal and state levels, UConn cannot afford to overlook an opportunity to promote belonging and access. Policy changes as simple as adopting hardship waivers or shifting the cost of a permit to the semester fee bill could bulldoze barriers without risking revenue.
Still, the foremost goal is to root out the idea that parking is a luxury, rather than the price of entry to the college experience. So long as the system persists, a drive to class is a roadblock to opportunity.

The No. 1 seed Smyrna Eagles take on the No. 2 seed Cape Henlopen in the division one field hockey state championship game. No. 1 Wilmington Friends faces off against No. 3 Newark Charter in the division two state championship game. 
 
The Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association (DIAA) is set to crown its 2025 division one and two field hockey state champions on Friday, November 7. Both championship games will be played at the University of Delaware’s Rullo Stadium.   
Smyrna and Cape Henlopen will face off in the division one state championship for the fifth consecutive time repeating a trend that started in the 2021 season. Wilmington Friends will take on Newark Charter in the division two championship game vying for their first state championship since 1986. Let’s take a look at each team’s path to the championship game.
No. 1 Smyrna Eagles:
The Eagles only lost one game throughout the regular season finishing with a 14-1 record. Smyrna outscored its opponents by multiple goals in all but two of its wins and finished with 92 total goals in the regular season. Smyrna’s defense only allowed 13 goals in that same time. 
The Eagles strong season netted them the No. 1 seed and a home quarterfinal game against No. 8 Middletown. Senior Bree Moffett led the way in that victory scoring a team-high three goals in the Eagles 8-0 win. Smyrna posted the same score in its semifinal matchup against No. 5 Caesar Rodney to advance to the championship.
No. 2 Cape Henlopen:
The Vikings started their 2025 season off the heels of their second consecutive state championship beating Smyrna for the 2024 title. This season, Cape Henlopen finished the regular season with the same 14-1 record Smyrna did. The Vikings only loss was a 3-2 defeat against the Eagles in late September.
Since then, the Vikings won nine straight games without allowing a single goal. Cape Henlopen defeated No. 7 Polytech, 8-0, in the quarterfinal and No. 3 Padua, 3-0, to advance to the championship game for the eighth year in a row. 
No. 1 Wilmington Friends:  
The Quakers ended as last season’s runner-up in the division two state championship losing a tough one score game against Delmar. This season the team won their first 14 games before losing their one and only game of the season to Tower Hill in their regular season finale. The Quakers’ 14-1 regular season record earned them a first round bye in the state tournament. 
Friends hosted No. 8 Sussex Academy in the quarterfinal round earning a 1-0 victory to advance to the semifinals. That was the first game this season Friends didn’t score multiple goals. The Quakers defeated No. 4 Archmere in the semifinals to earn a spot in the championship game as they did a season ago. 
No. 3 Newark Charter:
The Patriots started this season winning their first eight games before suffering their first defeat against Cape Henlopen. It was the Patriots only time being shutout this season. Newark Charter finished the regular season with a 11-4 record, the third seed in the post season tournament and a first round bye. 
Newark Charter’s first game of the post season ended in overtime. Senior Audrey Nelson delivered the Patriots to the semifinal round with her overtime goal against No. 6 Tower Hill on Halloween. The Patriots’ semifinal game against No. 2 Caravel didn’t go into an extra frame, but it finished in the same way as their quarterfinal matchup. Newark Charter defeated Caravel, 2-1, for a chance at the school’s first field hockey championship. 
The division two game is scheduled to start at 4:00 p.m. at Rullo Stadium followed by the division one game at 6:30 p.m. Both games are scheduled for Friday, November 7.

(USDA Photo by Lance Cheung.)The City-County of Butte-Silver Bow declared a local emergency on Wednesday because of the loss of SNAP benefits, the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance program.
Butte-Silver Bow Chief Executive JP Gallagher, who signed the proclamation, said he anticipated local commissioners would pass a corresponding emergency resolution to use $183,974 to alleviate food insecurity in the local community.
“Butte has gone through tough times, and people step up,” Gallagher told the Daily Montanan. “If the state and federal government aren’t going to step in, we’re going to do what we can with the resources we have.”
SNAP benefits, which roughly 77,000 Montanans receive, are entangled in political and legal battles in Washington, D.C., related to the federal shutdown.
In a Nov. 4 memo, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service said it is reducing the maximum SNAP benefit to 50% of an eligible household’s allotment for the month of November, citing limited funding and two court orders.
“State agencies must take immediate action to implement this reduction as specified in this memorandum,” said the memo, posted on the website of the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services.
The average household benefit in Montana is $332, according to DPHHS.
Wednesday in committee, the Department of Public Health and Human Services said it was working to recalculate benefits as directed in the memo.
Legislators asked DPHHS questions about getting SNAP to Montanans and the possibility of making up the shortfall.
Lawmakers also heard from SNAP recipients and social services providers who described record demand for food and urged the governor to tap state funds.
Gov. Greg Gianforte has maintained the federal problem should be fixed with federal funds, but he announced a donation to a statewide nonprofit based in Livingston with a mission to end hunger.
Butte-Silver Bow proclamation
Signed on Wednesday, the Butte-Silver Bow proclamation said the loss of benefits has created “immediate peril to the health, safety and welfare of vulnerable residents, including children, seniors and low-income households.”
It said the disruption also has placed “extraordinary strain on local food banks, senior centers, shelters and other human service providers.”
In Montana, such a declaration allows a local government to levy up to two mills on the taxable valuation of a jurisdiction to address the crisis, although Gallagher said Butte-Silver Bow planned to tap reserves rather than levy additional mills.
Gallagher, the elected chief executive, said he anticipated the Butte-Silver Bow Council of Commissioners would likely pass the resolution at its evening meeting Wednesday, Nov. 5.
(He said the plan was to use the funds to support local organizations rather than pay the benefit to families directly.)
Gallagher said even if the federal government fully restored funding, SNAP benefits wouldn’t get to families in time, and lack of food is one of the biggest challenges for mental health, when parents can’t feed their children.
“We know this is a time when families are really feeling effects,” Gallagher said.
Children and Families committee asks questions, hears pleas
Wednesday, DPHHS officials told legislators on the Children, Families, Health and Human Services Committee that the agency is in the midst of recalculating benefits based on the memo received one day earlier.
In response to a question from Sen. Cora Neumann, DPHHS Director Charlie Brereton said he anticipates funds will be loaded onto families’ electronic benefit cards starting next week and into the following week.
Neumann, a Democrat from Bozeman, asked if the state was looking at ways to make up the SNAP shortfall.
In particular, Neumann asked if DPHHS planned to use an unspent $75 million in federal TANF funds, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which she said can be directed to families with children in need.
Brereton said DPHHS has looked at TANF, but it is “resource constrained” and has shifted gears to focus on responding to the federal directive on SNAP.
However, he said it has not made a final determination on TANF funds, and in response to Neumann, said those are the only possible funds under discussion at DPHHS to potentially make up the shortfall.
Brereton said DPHHS would only move ahead in coordination with the Governor’s Office, and he reminded the committee that Gianforte has said he will not use state funds to pay for the federal SNAP suspension.
Some Democratic state legislators have said the Montana Legislature ensured a state account, the debt and liability free account, could be used for federal shortfalls such as SNAP, and it has money.
Rep. SJ Howell said they were concerned some households would receive no dollars at all, or less than $10 or $20, given the federal guidance. Howell, a Missoula Democrat, asked how many people that might be in Montana.
DPHHS said the calculations are underway, but the first priority has been to ensure the agency is generating accurate benefits based on the federal guidance.
At the meeting, many social services advocates told legislators that Montanans, especially ones who are already vulnerable, are in dire straits, and they called on the governor to help.
“We urge the governor to release available state funds for SNAP so that Montanans with disabilities, older adults and families who rely on this essential support, do not experience further hardship,” Cassie Wick, with Ability Montana, said. “Every day of delay deepens food insecurity and undermines the stability of those who are already facing the greatest barriers.”
Ella Smith, with the Montana Community Action Network, reported significant increases in demand at member food banks and pay-what-you-can facilities, and they urged action from the governor
One food bank that typically sees 80 families a day served 160 last Tuesday, and the same day, a pay-what-you-can restaurant that usually sees 125 people served 203 meals, Smith said.
“We receive hundreds of calls from panicked people who are not getting heat or food assistance,” Smith said.
Kiera Condon, with the Montana Food Bank Network, said the organization is facing record demand, but it cannot fill the gap left by the SNAP cuts.
Condon said slashing the SNAP benefit to 50% will devastate households that are already struggling to afford food. She said the calculation means many families will actually receive “far less than half” of their normal benefits, including no benefit.
“Families are still caught in crisis and are facing delays, confusion and real food fear about when they’ll be able to buy food again,” Condon said.
Condon also called on the state to develop a plan for how it will protect families “if the federal government fails again” and establish clear communication protocols between DPHHS, food banks and the public.
Christa Gabriel, with Disability Rights Montana, said one in three people who receive SNAP benefits are people with disabilities.
Gabriel said they are twice as likely to be unemployed because of their disability, and they are “relying on SNAP for nutrition, independence and survival.”
People who have disabilities have additional barriers that make it more difficult to go to a food pantry, Gabriel said. They may not have reliable transportation and need to coordinate it, or may not be able to stand in a long line at a food bank.
Governor donates to food nonprofit
Gianforte has said he won’t use state money to fund SNAP, a federal program, without the promise of federal reimbursement, and he did not change course Wednesday.
Wednesday, Gianforte announced he was donating a quarter of his annual salary to The Producer Partnership, a Livingston nonprofit with a mission to end hunger in Montana.
Gianforte is a multimillionaire and former tech entrepreneur; as governor, he earns a salary of roughly $142,000. He has donated his salary every year he’s been in office.
“As Montanans, we look out for one another and help our neighbors in times of need,” said Gianforte, a Republican, in a statement. “Producer Partnership brings together folks from across our ag community to help feed families.
“I am proud to support their work and the difference they are making for people all across our state especially in a time when vulnerable Montanans and food banks are feeling the pinch of the Democrat-led shutdown.”
Republicans are blaming Democrats for not voting to reopen the federal government. Democrats have said they are waiting for a deal that includes extending health care subsidies in the Affordable Care Act.
Wednesday, following major Democratic wins across the country on Election Day, top Democratic congressional leaders pushed for a meeting with President Donald Trump to end the shutdown, the longest in U.S. history as of Wednesday, States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C., Bureau reported.
 


 The Producer Partnership
The Producer Partnership “partners with livestock producers across the state by processing donated livestock into top quality protein and providing it to food banks to help those in need,” according to its website.
It has donated an estimated 350,000 pounds since it opened in 2020.
A news release from the Governor’s Office said Producer Partnership is Montana’s first USDA inspected nonprofit meat processing facility.
It employs 10 full-time staff members, works with the Montana Food Bank Network to get protein to food banks across the state, and operates an internship program for local high school students.
“The salary donation is huge for us,” said Matt Pierson, founder of Producer Partnership, in a statement about Gov. Greg Gianforte’s donation. “There is so much potential for what we can do, in terms of intern programs to expanding what we already have and trying to turn this different model into something sustainable and productive.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/usdafood-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-11-05 22:17:10.141212

(Photo by Nick Dentamaro/Brown University)Over two decades after the United States invaded Iraq, former Secretary of State Condolezza Rice admits she has some regrets over the decision.
She wishes intelligence officials during President George W. Bush’s administration had known in 2003 that the reported weapons of mass destruction were not being rebuilt to the extent initially believed. 
And she laments the lives lost on both sides during the eight years of conflict, which killed over 4,400 U.S. service members and wounded over 30,000, while an estimated 200,000 Iraqi civilians died. 
But Rice, 70, said she still believes the U.S. made the right decision in toppling Saddam Hussein’s regime.
“I do believe that the world is better off without Saddam Hussein,” she told the crowd of 1,200 sitting inside Brown University’s Pizzitola Sports Center Wednesday evening. “[They’re] beginning to develop a fragile democracy, but nonetheless a democracy. If we stand by them, I think they can get it right.”
Rice’s reflection on one of the century’s most controversial military actions came about during an hourlong question-and-answer session evening as part of its Stephen A. Ogden Jr. ’60 Memorial Lecture on International Affairs.
Over the years, Brown’s Ogden Lectures have featured prominent speakers such as the Dalai Lama, former U.K. Prime Minister Teresa May, and the final leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev.
Rice’s successor as the nation’s top diplomat, Hillary Rodham Clinton, spoke before a crowd of 1,800 on Oct. 30. 
Hillary Clinton opens up about the past, present and future in Brown lecture

“This year we’ve had two Ogden lectures in two consecutive weeks given by two amazing former secretaries of state,” University President Christina Paxson said in her introductory remarks. “This is certainly a first in Brown’s history.” 
While Rice still backs the Iraq War, she said she feels “a real sorrow” for Afghanistan, where U.S. forces pulled out under President Joe Biden in 2021.
“If I had known we were going to be that impatient with a country that was coming out of civil war, maybe we would have done something differently,” she said. “I feel especially bad for the women of Afghanistan — we gave them a chance over 20 years.”
Many of Rice’s remarks echoed some of the responses given by Clinton the week before. She expressed a similar disdain for Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying he operates at only two speeds: oppression and intimidation.
In 2007, Bush administration officials were in Russia to address the pressure Putin’s government was placing on neighboring Georgia — parts of which Russia went on to occupy in 2008.
Rice and Putin were on opposite couches when he quickly stood up to peer over her. On instinct, she said she stood up too.
“In heels, I’m sort of 5’10” or so — he’s not,” she said, eliciting some laughs and applause.
Similar to Clinton, Rice commended the Trump administration for negotiating a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas and agreed that peace in the region will only be achieved if other Arab Gulf Nation states play a role.
Though Rice said she believes leaders in the Middle East are ready to move on from the war.
“The Arabs would like to get on with modernization,” she said.
Rice recalled a recent trip to Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Dubai, where she said Palestine was mentioned only once.
“The rest was about data centers and AI.” she said. 
Rice is especially passionate about artificial intelligence and the need for the United States to be on the cutting edge of such technology, as she serves on the board of directors for C3.ai. Right now, she said it’s a race between the U.S. and China.
“I want democracy to win this race,” she said. “If there’s going to be a generally intelligent robot, I want her to speak English, not Chinese.”
But Rice, the director at the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace at Stanford University, said she’s worried that the nation may not mobilize quickly enough to win the race if federal funding is taken from research universities.
“Fundamental research is done in universities,” she said. “You won’t find anyone more capitalistic than I am, but I don’t want all of the innovation to be in commercial entities.”
Rice took some shots at the foreign policy approaches taken by the Trump administration, even though she never said the president’s name. She criticized his decision to clamp down on student visas.
“The United States has to be a place that welcomes the best talent from all over the world,” Rice said.
She also mentioned the need to speak up for immigrants.
“This country is a country of immigrants,” she said.

Yesterday, in a suburb seven miles north of Boston, thousands of voters managed to do the opposite: They mobilized in an off-cycle election year to tax themselves.
On Tuesday, the voters of Melrose voted 54 percent to 46 percent to increase municipal property taxes to raise an additional $13.5 million in revenue, restoring many of the cuts that have been made to the city’s budget in recent years, through a Proposition 2 ½ override.  
Enacted in 1980 through a ballot measure, Prop 2 ½ puts a strict limit on the amount municipalities can raise their total property tax levy year-over-year to 2.5 percent, plus new growth. Melrose has only passed two overrides since 1990, the most recent of which was in 2019. Just last year, Melrose voters rejected an override proposal that would raise $7.7 million in revenue.
The vote comes as Melrose officials were having an increasingly difficult time looking for new budget line items to cut. As a suburban city with many commuters working in Boston, Melrose does not have a strong industrial base, meaning the vast majority of its revenue comes from property taxes. The 2.5 percent rate of increase is not keeping pace with costs, and the city’s requirement for the council to pass a balanced budget has led to spending cuts to the city’s senior center, police, and libraries. The effects on Melrose’s public schools were an especially motivating factor for many voters.
“Some of our amazing educators, and especially a lot of our best educators who really give it their all, they are being strained beyond reason,” said Mary Caddle, chair of the “Yes for Melrose” campaign advocating for the override. She and her co-chair, Thomas Karthus, are both parents of children currently in Melrose public schools.
In the past two years, Melrose has cut over forty teaching and administrative positions in its schools. Melrose already ranks in the bottom eight percent of Massachusetts school districts in spending per pupil, spending $18,600 per child in fiscal year 2024. (The state average in 2023, the most recent data available, was $21,300.) Melrose’s MCAS scores have remained competitive compared to the rest of the state, but parents are worried about the future impact of further straining school resources today.
“The MCAS scores that you’re seeing now are as much a reflection of the education that many of the students have gotten over the last several years … but there’s a question of, where does this go from here?” said Karthus. “We’re going to continue losing teachers if we don’t pass an override, and at some point, probably a decade down the line, we’re going to start to see those scores drop.”
On Tuesday’s election day, a large group of “Yes” campaign supporters gathered in front of the Melrose Veterans Memorial Middle School, the only in-person polling place for this year’s off-cycle election. One of the supporters, Stephanie Turner, spoke about how teacher cuts have affected her children’s classrooms.
“We’ve seen larger classrooms in the elementary schools. I think one of our classrooms is now up to 26. When we started in the elementary school they were closer to 18,” Turner said. “But we’ve also seen turnover, too, and I think that’s representative of teacher salaries. Our teacher salaries are not competitive. The teachers that stay in Melrose are certainly not staying in Melrose for the compensation. I think they like the school, or they like the community.”
The cuts Melrose has had to make do not end at educational spending. Caddle noted that Melrose used to have a social worker at city hill to help any resident but now there’s only part time social worker at the senior center.
The ballot measure had a tiered structure. Responding to resident feedback after the 2024 override failure that people wanted more options, voters could vote in favor of three different amounts to raise revenue by: $9.3 million, $11.9 million, and $13.5 million. Voters could vote in favor of all three – the highest amount that received a majority of “yes” votes is the one the city would enact.
In 2024, about 4,300 Melrose voters voted in favor of a $7.7 million override, with about 5,200 against. This year, the number of “no” votes stayed about the same, but the number of “yes” votes went up to 6,000, increasing overall turnout by about 1,600 voters.
The increases per tax bill won’t be cheap. The average single-family home in Melrose is worth $817,630; According to the “Yes” campaign’s override impact calculator, the property tax burden on the average homeowner will increase by $1,380 per year. The measure will also compound as the $13.5 million gets added to the city’s base levy rate, which will be raised by at least 2.5 percent each year going forward.
One of the few “No” supporters outside the polling place on the afternoon of the election balked at the price tag, saying there were other ways the city can make do with what it has.
“There’s so many more people coming into the city. There’s plenty of money to work with,” saidresident Jim Doherty. “It’s almost like [“No” supporters] are being painted like we’re hating to have to give more money to the kids. That’s not the point. … Right now it’s just a tough, tough time with the economy to keep out looking for more.”
The revenue raised by the override will go to the city’s general fund and then be appropriated to the categories of spending the city says the money will be used for, including restoring 17 school and seven other municipal positions. But technically, the city is not legally required to follow through on its promises. This was a motivating factor for some “No” campaigners.
“I was holding out a sign the other day in front of City Hall,” said Doherty. “Somebody pulled up in their car and said, ‘Why don’t you move? ‘I said to the guy nicely, ‘It’s all about accountability.’”
Karthus trusts that Melrose residents will maintain the pressure to make sure that funding is restored in line with the city’s proposed plan.
“It’s not a blank check for the mayor to go fund what she wants to fund,” he said. “Everything that’s spent has to go through the school committee and the city council in public hearings. There will be eyes on this.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2468.jpg?fit=1024%2C771&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-05 21:56:11.999731

“It’s like Dancing with the Stars,” Arkansas Foodbank Marketing and Communications Director Kate Jenkins remarked on Tuesday, raising her voice to be heard as two pallet jacks zoomed past, honking repeatedly.

This practiced, consequential dance takes place inside the food bank’s 99,000-square-foot Little Rock warehouse every day and enables the organization to push millions of pounds of food out to food pantries across 33 counties. It’s even more important now, as multiple Arkansas food pantries that rely on food from Arkansas Foodbank see surges in demand from some of the state’s most food-insecure residents.
Officials at three food pantries — two in Little Rock, one in Cabot — reported spikes in demand in recent weeks as those who normally receive federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits steeled themselves for possibly losing the help due to the congressional spending impasse, a first in the program’s history. While the pantry workers said they’ve seen some furloughed federal workers, the demand appears to be driven by those who already struggle to afford food in a state already ranked as the most food insecure.


What the pantries need
The Advocate asked each of the three food pantries what they would get if a truck magically arrived with the things they needed most. These are their answers:

Helping Hand of Greater Little Rock: Peanut butter, macaroni and cheese and canned goods. Executive Director Margaret Douglas also said she is constantly fielding calls from people worried about how they will celebrate Thanksgiving later this month. “I would welcome a truck from Tyson to bring me a truckload of turkeys to give out,” she said.
Salvation Army of Little Rock: Shelf-stable foods, dry goods, meat products. “We’re running low on canned goods,” Central Arkansas Commander Kenny Igleheart said.
Hope’s Closet and Pantry: Canned vegetables, and breakfast items and snacks for children.

People can donate to each food pantry via their websites, linked above.  Those who need assistance finding food can search for food pantries near them on Arkansas Foodbank’s website.


Meanwhile, Gavin Lesnick, a spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Human Services, said the agency has received guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture on paying out partial food assistance benefits after federal courts ruled that failing to use contingency funds to pay November benefits during the shutdown was likely unlawful.
After the court rulings, USDA said Monday it would pay each enrolled household half of what it would normally receive. But the payments still haven’t gone out in Arkansas, and it isn’t clear when they will.
“We are reviewing this information and developing plans to provide these benefits as soon as possible,” Lesnick said in an email. “We will need to recalculate benefit amounts for all recipients, and cannot yet advise a date when benefits will be issued.”
While the funds remain in limbo, Arkansas Foodbank has kept supplying pallets of food to food pantries across the state, such as Helping Hand of Greater Little Rock. Executive Director Margaret Douglas said her pantry hosted Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders during its Tuesday morning distribution and then had to turn families away after they ran out of items to give out.

“We had 75 people waiting outside the door at 9 o’clock this morning for food,” Douglas said Wednesday. “Normally we run between 80 to 100. Today, we had 112 families, and it’s been that way all week.”
Arkansas Foodbank can’t supply its food pantries with the amounts of food they would need to fully address the need created by the SNAP delays, Jenkins said. The nonprofit would have to distribute three times more than it already does in a single day to do so.
“The charitable food system just doesn’t have the structure for that, even if we had infinite amounts of money,” Jenkins said. “We have some families that have been turned away because there’s not enough food left that day.”
Arkansas Foodbank is better off than some — it only relies on federal funds for about 15% of its needs. But the increased demand — almost double what they typically face, Jenkins said — is still far beyond what they can supply.
“We’re seeing a COVID-level demand, and we don’t have a COVID-level amount of funding because a lot of it came from the federal government,” Jenkins said.
The shutdown is greatly affecting people, Helping Hand’s Douglas said. The pantry gives out  enough food to each family to last seven to ten days “if they know how to really stretch the food,” but it’s struggling to meet the demand for meat products.
“We try to give meat, but we’re having to stretch our meat now,” Douglas said. “Yesterday, we ran out of meat.”
After cutting off distribution at 100 families on Tuesday, Douglas said she was able to go “a little over that” on Wednesday. What would happen when distribution began Thursday was an open question.
“Tomorrow, I do have some meat to start tomorrow off with, but that’s it,” Douglas said. “We’re here, and we’re doing what we can, and distributing. It’s where your faith really comes in, and I have to pray a lot.”
Kenny Igleheart, the Central Arkansas commander of the Salvation Army, said 50% to 75% of the people arriving at its food pantry in Little Rock recently “have never been here before.”
“Most have been local residents whose benefits have been curtailed,” Igleheart said. “It’s been a challenge, it’s been a significant increase over what we had previously.”
While giving the Advocate a tour of the Arkansas Foodbank’s cavernous warehouse, Jenkins said it was hard to drive home the staggering needs created by the SNAP delay for most people.

“I don’t think people understand that there is literally no way for us to meet this very immediate need,” Jenkins said.
Some states, like Louisiana and Virginia, are planning on spending millions to shore up their state’s SNAP recipients until Congress funds the program.
Sanders announced $500,000 in emergency funds last week, which was split between six food banks, including Arkansas Foodbank. Additional pots of $500,000 could be released each week if deemed necessary, a press release from her office said at the time.
“The Governor is in close contact with state agencies, legislators, churches, and food banks to monitor the ongoing situation, and all options remain on the table should Senate Democrats continue their government shutdown,” Sanders spokesperson Sam Dubke said in an email Wednesday.
Some Arkansas Democrats have called on Sanders to declare a disaster to pay SNAP benefits, but it is unclear if the state law allows for disaster funds to be used to provide food assistance payments.
In the meantime, pantries are trying to meet hungry Arkansans’ needs.
Kimberly Buchberger, founder, owner and director of Hope’s Closet and Pantry in Cabot, said her food pantry has seen a 50% increase in families showing up to distributions — 109 families came to the pantry by midday Wednesday and 142 came on Tuesday. And recently, around 25% of the people coming to the pantry had never sought out help from one before, she said.
The spike started last week. But this week has been harder.
“It hit us hard this past Tuesday,” Buchberger said. “I had two ladies tell me today, ‘I get food stamps, but I’ve never had to come to a food pantry before. This is my first time.’ And I’m like, ‘Welcome to our organized chaos.’”
Her food pantry is well-prepared for the additional demand, she said, and she has not yet needed to turn anyone away. Buchberger said she’s told neighbors to pay their bills, and that she would help them find ways to feed themselves with whatever money they had leftover.
Buchberger said she started a sponsorship program, similar to the Angel Tree program, last week to address the increased need in her community. 100 families applied, she said, and more sponsors are needed.
Buchberger said she is taking each day as it comes.
“I’m not going to worry and I’m not going to stress because I believe in Jesus,” Buchberger said. “I’m going to take care of today, and I’m going to pray for tomorrow.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PB042343-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-05 20:56:50.792877

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Benjamin Houlton touted his experience with, and passion for, land-grant universities during a public forum Wednesday as the higher education leader sought to persuade a crowd of Iowa State University students, staff and community members that he would be the best pick for the institution’s new president.
Currently dean of Cornell University’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Houlton is a finalist for ISU’s soon-to-be-vacant presidency, with President Wendy Wintersteen set to retire in January. He was the first of two finalists to visit Ames this week, with North Dakota State President David Cook set to hold his own forum on campus Thursday.
After a day of interviews with university leadership and other officials, Houlton spoke during an open forum. Calling ISU “the pioneer” for land-grant institutions and their mission, Houlton said he wants to take the foundation that Wintersteen has formed and “speed it onward” to even greater heights.

“The land grant mission is the soul of a university. It’s the embodiment of the soul. It is service to society, for the public good,” Houlton said. “It’s beyond the walls of the classroom, although it happens in there in amazing ways, it’s beyond the labs, although you see outstanding work happening over and over in the labs, it’s beyond the personalities. It has generational impact that transcends time, and you know this better than anyone here at ISU.”
Two of his main priorities once officially becoming president would be to craft a collaborative strategic plan that all levels of the university have a hand in, through surveys and other engagement opportunities, and launching a “historic fundraising campaign.”
In his capacity as dean at Cornell University — a land grant institution — Houlton updated curricula for the first time since 1999 with a focus on “student experiential learning and entrepreneurship, agriculture and food systems, data science and data literacy, ethics, and physical/biological sciences” and opened a research and innovation office, according to his curriculum vitae, posted online by the Iowa Board of Regents.
He also expanded endowed professorships and hiring of tenure-track faculty and brought undergraduate applications to “an all-time high,” his CV stated.
Houlton has prior experience working in areas of the environment and related areas beyond his work at Cornell, including his time from 2016 to 2020 as director of the University of California-Davis Institute of the Environment — the institution’s largest organized research unit, according to his CV.
Six pillars for a thriving institution
In his presentation to the in-person and virtual audience, Houlton provided pillars he’d like to focus on at ISU if he is chosen as president, spanning greater investment in partnerships and new technologies and programs, supporting every level of ISU community member and more. The first was about recruiting talented people across campus departments, from STEM fields to the humanities.
“We need our social scientists and humanities working together with our technical scientists, so (I’m) thinking about cohort style recruitments that can build across disciplines,” Houlton said.
Houlton also wants to expand ISU’s capacity and offerings surrounding artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies, such as quantum, and further technological partnerships.
He said ISU’s extension offices should get involved in AI education for Iowans wondering about these tools, and bodies like the Ames National Lab, ISU Research Park and Pappajohn Center for Entrepreneurship should strategize and collaborate into research and business opportunities that rival the “big bets” being made in China.
“This is where ISU has already shined brightly, but there’s still more that can be done,” Houlton said. “From a land grant perspective, the research education and translation of science is a vital element of meeting the impact around us.”
Experts in humanities and social sciences should also be a part of this work, Houlton said, to ensure AI exploration is “people-centered” and aimed toward the public good.
Houlton called the third pillar “uncommon partnerships for the common good,” and said he would look at ISU’s extension and outreach program to “see how we can start to mobilize it as more of an ecosystem that operates on behalf of the changes that we need to see.”
Growing industry partnerships is also important as more research breakthroughs come from private corporations, Houlton said, as well as paying attention to global markets and supply chains and thinking about how ISU could fit into the international stage.
The fourth and fifth pillars involved enrollment and excellence in business operations and staff. Houlton said ISU should “double down on the innovation model” that allows students attending ISU to earn their degree while starting a business or meeting other milestones, which is done through entrepreneurship opportunities, microcredentials and other shortened degree programs.
At Cornell, Houlton said appreciation was shown for staff and the exemplary work they do through award programs, something he’d like to bring to ISU.
In the last pillar, which Houlton titled “Let’s go Cyclones,” he said the CyTown development project currently underway is an amazing example of “outstanding vision of leadership” for a land grant institution.
“This is a land grant in action. Our athletics bring us into the living rooms of all of society. There’s evidence that when teams do really well, applications go way up,” Houlton said. “So it’s not just about the school spirit and the affinity and the alumni, but CyTown as a corridor of innovation, research, you know, all sorts of things that can happen.”
Audience concerned about civic education, funding streams
Questions for the presidential hopeful from ISU faculty, staff and students ranged from financial to civic.
Center for Cyclone Civics Co-director Karen Kedrowski asked about the “role of higher education in supporting and strengthening American democracy” as concerns grow about “the erosion of our democratic norms” and Americans not knowing enough about the workings of their government.
Tying his answer back to his passion, Houlton said ISU should “continue to pioneer the land grant mission,” as that mission connects to “this unique grand experiment of America and people’s shot at the American dream.” Universities must also ensure they are upholding the values of the U.S. Constitution and giving students a baseline knowledge of how the American government works.
ISU materials science and engineering professor Steve Martin told Houlton he doesn’t see ISU’s current financial situation as “sustainable,” having gone from 70% of the institutional budget funded by state allocations when he started to it only making up 30% of the budget now, with income from student tuition mostly filling the gap.
Houlton said there are two avenues the institution should turn to when state budgets are tight and funding could remain flat — philanthropy and identifying efficiencies.
Benjamin Houlton, Cornell ag college dean, announced as ISU presidential finalist

Expanding fundraising efforts is something Houlton has done before, he said, having increased financial aid at Cornell from $30 million per year to $48 million per year and grown endowed professorships from 7% of faculty to 15%.
“I would advocate strongly for where I see a return on investment, but I would also understand that it’s complicated, and there might not be the resources available,” Houlton said. “So institutions have to develop significant philanthropy for scholarships, endowed professorships and the fundamental needs of an institution.”
When talking about efficiencies, Houlton said he wasn’t referring to “people losing jobs,” but “working more efficiently across an organization, because we do have to figure out ways to cut costs, and cutting costs is important for the future.” He said he loves university budgets and the ISU budget should tell the story of a land grant mission being fulfilled through supporting students, research, partnerships and more.
Weston Abney, ISU record analyst and president of the union representing university clerical workers, asked the last question of the evening — what would Houlton’s response be to having “received an order from the Board of Regents to terminate an employee for something that they posted on Facebook?”
ISU presidential search committee co-chair and Faculty Senate President Meghan Gillette cut in after the question was posed to “reword” it and ask about his relationship with Cornell’s board of trustees, explaining that he doesn’t have all of the information of the case Abney mentioned.
He was referencing former ISU employee Caitlyn Spencer, whose employment was terminated by the university after posting negatively about slain right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk after his death. Iowa Board of Regents President Sherry Bates said at the time universities would have two weeks to investigate and handle, up to termination, such cases.
Houlton said social media is a “complicated landscape,” and while he couldn’t specifically speak about Spencer’s case, he believes it is inappropriate for individuals to say things on social media that are “violent” and he would make sure threatening speech not covered by the First Amendment is “dealt with.”

(Photo by Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)At first glance, the results of Tuesday’s state Supreme Court election appear unremarkable compared to any other statewide judicial retention vote in the last 19 years, Pennsylvania political observers said. 
Justices Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty and David Wecht, first elected as Democrats in 2015, won voters’ consent to continue serving on the state’s highest court for another 10-year term. Each did so with more than 60% of the vote, according to unofficial returns, similar to the margins in other recent statewide retention elections.
That was despite a concerted effort by conservative groups to persuade voters to term-limit the Supreme Court and paint the justices as liberal activists legislating from the bench. 
“Even though there was an effort to make them look more partisan, they looked very much like they usually do,” Berwood Yost, director of the Franklin and Marshall College poll, told the Capital-Star.
Below the surface, however, the results may reveal signs of a shift amid voters’ displeasure at political gridlock and a sense that fundamental rights are under attack. 
Pa. justices win retention for 10-year terms on state Supreme Court

In the Supreme Court race, at least one of the three justices won retention in 17 counties President Donald Trump carried last year, the results show.
“If you look at the ‘yes’ votes and compare it to Kamala Harris’ performance, the average difference is about 15 points,” Yost  said, noting that the margin in partisan elections for Superior and Commonwealth court seats was smaller.
A year after the GOP’s presidential and congressional wins, Republican Party of Pennsylvania Chairperson Greg Rothman said in a statement that the party was undeterred by Tuesday’s losses and would refine its strategy for next year.
“We knew this would be a tough election cycle, but if the choice is to fight or run, we will always choose to stand and fight,” Rothman said. “We need to do a better job of communicating our core principals of freedom, security, prosperity and opportunity for all, and our vision for the future.”
Had the “vote no” campaign, backed by groups associated with Montgomery County billionaire Jeff Yass, succeeded, the justices could have been the first since 2005 to lose their retention bids. 
Instead, Democrats responded with a counter offensive, drawing comparisons to Wisconsin’s Supreme Court election, where the world’s richest man Elon Musk injected about $30 million of his own money in an unsuccessful effort to break up a Democratic majority there.
“The Democrats had a potent case,” Muhlenberg College political science professor Christopher Borick said. “They told voters, ‘protect reproductive rights’ and ‘don’t let billionaires decide things for you.’”
The “vote no” campaign, by comparison, was less compelling, Penn State political science professor Daniel Mallinson said. He said messaging by the conservative Commonwealth Partners, which has close ties to Yass and a series of pro-school choice political committees Yass funds, was vague.

In states with similar retention elections, judges are most often ousted in response to a scandal, whether real or perceived. In 2009, voters kicked three Iowa Supreme Court justices off the bench after the court voted to legalize same-sex marriage. And in the only instance from Pennsylvania, Justice Russell Nigro lost his retention election in 2005 amid backlash after lawmakers held a midnight vote to give themselves and judge pay raises. 
“People just need a clear and specific reason to get rid of a judge otherwise,” Mallinson said.
Tuesday’s win for Donohue, Dougherty and Wecht in Pennsylvania’s marquee race for an off-year election was part of a Democratic sweep right down the ballot. In addition to the other statewide races for the lower Superior and Commonwealth courts, Democrats prevailed in what state party Chairperson Eugene DePasquale called “the swingiest of swing counties,” in a swing state.

He highlighted Democrat Danny Ceisler’s defeat of incumbent Bucks County Sheriff Fred Harran, who raised hackles in the suburban Philadelphia county by entering an agreement to assist federal authorities in immigration enforcement. In Erie County, Democrat Christina Vogel defeated incumbent County Executive Brenton Davis by nearly 25 points.  
“We won the majority of the Dallastown School District. We defeated the Moms for Liberty in Cumberland County. We swept school districts throughout Allegheny County,” he said. “This was much deeper than just winning in deep blue areas of Pennsylvania.”
In a call with reporters Wednesday, Democratic National Committee Chairperson Ken Martin said the party’s success across the country, including gubernatorial wins in New Jersey and Virginia, bodes well for the 2026 midterm elections.
“The Democratic Party is all gas, no brakes. We’re not going to slow down now,” Martin said. “And to all the Republicans who have bowed a cowardly knee to Trump all year while screwing over families, consider this: We’re coming after your jobs next.”
With only the judicial races to go by, Borick said there’s no guarantee of a repeat in Pennsylvania next year. World events, economic conditions and the Trump administration’s shifting policies will play a role in voters’ outlooks, he added.
And past Democratic success in state Supreme Court races isn’t an indicator of future performance, Borick said, pointing to 2023’s election of Democratic Justice Daniel McCaffery followed by 2024’s Republican sweep. 
But if Democratic campaigns focus on issues like affordability, health care and reproductive rights and downplay social and cultural issues, Borick said “It could be repeated if done right in 2026.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/judicial-retention-2025-scaled-e1762391127404-1024x761.jpeg,,,2025-11-05 20:16:51.363007

(Photos courtesy of campaigns)A close contest between two Democrats for a Washington state House seat tightened further Wednesday.
Kevin Schilling’s lead on state Rep. Edwin Obras shrank to 199 votes in their 33rd Legislative District duel in south King County. The district includes Burien, Normandy Park, Des Moines, SeaTac and much of Kent.
Schilling, the mayor of Burien, led Obras by 358 votes on Tuesday night. More votes will be counted in the days ahead.
“We are excited we got a lot closer. We will keep looking at the numbers the next couple days but this is a good sign,” said John Wyble, Obras’s campaign advisor. “The most important thing is that every vote is counted.”
Schilling also preached patience citing the many ballots left to tally.
“We always knew no matter what it was going to be a close race,” he said. Noting his campaign knocked on 30,000 doors, he added, “Each vote matters. Each of those conversations is going to be a big difference maker here.”
Obras, from SeaTac, was appointed in December, filling the vacancy created when Democratic state Rep. Tina Orwall moved from the House to the Senate. 
He was one of nine Democratic state lawmakers seeking to retain their seats in Tuesday’s election. As the results stood on Wednesday, he is the only one facing the potential of getting dislodged from office.
Schilling, served as political director for retired congressman Derek Kilmer. He enjoyed the backing of U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Bellevue, Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove and Secretary of State Steve Hobbs. 
Obras snagged endorsements from U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Seattle, state Superintendent Chris Reykdal and many House colleagues. 
Schilling outspent Obras by a slight sum, $283,000 to Obras’ $237,000. But outside groups spent hundreds of thousands more on independent campaigns targeting each candidate.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-06 00:56:15+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,We shouldn’t force a one-size-fits-all approach to reading instruction,Susan Flis and Nicole Prevost,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/we-shouldnt-force-a-one-size-fits-all-approach-to-reading-instruction/,Lawmakers must resist the misleading call to mandate ‘evidence-based’ literacy curriculum,"THE URGENCY TO address deficits in reading proficiency is justifiable and shared by anyone with a stake in our public education system – which is to say, everyone in the Commonwealth. 
But the way to bring all students to where they need to be in terms of literacy skills is not through legislative directives on curriculum. This approach has not borne sustained positive results in other states and muddies sound educational practices, which are best handled by teachers and school staff and not by politicians. 
The literacy bill recently passed by the House of Representatives adopted some of the concerns that educators have been raising through this debate, including the need to invest in school libraries, librarians, and reading specialists. But the premise of legislating curriculum still is deeply problematic as the Senate takes up its literacy bill. 
Together with Julie Hackett, superintendent of Lexington Public Schools, and Jill Kerper Mora, associate professor emerita from San Diego State University’s School of Teacher Education, we recently met with legislators and legislative staff to explain educators’ opposition to restrictive, mandated reading curriculum. 
The bills in question describe the prescribed curriculum as “evidence based” or “science based,” which are misleading terms. The science of teaching reading is evolving, and we certainly have evidence-based interventions that work, but there is no one-size-fits-all “evidence-based” curriculum. 
While phonics is an essential element of literacy education, we cannot exclude the other components that go into language and literacy or withhold any of the proven techniques that educators use to teach reading. 
It would be wrong to restrict the use of any tool that an educator can use to teach reading, especially to students who do not have English as their first language and benefit from cues that have proven effective. 
If you look at reading proficiency among students in grade 4 in Missouri and Maryland – just two of the 30 states that approved reading bills calling for “evidence-based curricula” that prioritize phonics – you can see trend lines from 2011 to now that show proficiency rates rising and falling, sometimes revealing students doing better than the national average, sometimes dipping below the national average. These ebbs and flows occurred both before and after a reading bill was passed. 
The point is that the needs of any given student population change over time, sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly. Educators are trained to meet those changes, and they need freedom, support, and professional autonomy to do so. 
The reading bills on Beacon Hill are essentially asking the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to endorse a few phonics-heavy reading curricula that districts can choose from, greatly restricting educator autonomy.  
In addition, this legislation introduces an unfunded mandate and will cause fiscal chaos in districts, as new curriculum can cost between $500,000 and $1 million. Imagine the perverse irony if this bill forced districts to cut staff to buy new, unproven curriculum.  
No single curriculum is as important as teacher expertise when it comes to student achievement. Rather than focusing on narrow curriculum, policymakers should keep their focus on supporting educator preparation and professional development.  
In Massachusetts, our educators are extremely well-trained, combining coursework and field work in classrooms, including 300 hours of work in a classroom before being eligible for a license.  All educator preparation programs are now required to include coursework and experience in using evidence-based literacy instruction.  
The bills under consideration contradict our state’s own academic framework that calls for diversified approaches to teaching literacy. 
Educators need to be able to exercise professional judgment and autonomy in how to guide students through the chosen curriculum. Micromanaging classrooms from the state level is an ineffective and troubling approach to public education. The state education department can certainly play a role in keeping track of successes and failures to help guide districts toward effective curricula and strategies. 
If the Legislature is serious about playing a meaningful role in helping boost literacy rates across the state, we urge lawmakers to:  

Increase funding and access to high-quality public pre-K programs. 


Invest in school libraries, librarians, and reading specialists. 


Support recruitment, training, and professional development for public school educators. 

The House bill has already recognized the need for some of these measures to be put in place.  
Our students come to school ready to learn; we need to be ready to meet their needs.

It’s yet another threat to the survival of already-struggling farms.
This ill-conceived law, often called Washington’s “Mini-WARN” Act in a nod to the 1988 federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, began as state Senate Bill 5525 this spring, sponsored by Sen. Annette Cleveland, D-Vancouver. The bill passed the Legislature along party lines with Democratic support, and Gov. Bob Ferguson signed it into law May 13.
The measure’s new regulations on farming, an industry the federal WARN Act exempted, highlight how out of touch many politicians and bureaucrats are when it comes to understanding agriculture. Farming is not a static, year-round, nine-to-five operation.
Farming, since time immemorial, has been seasonal. Generations of farmers and farmworkers have structured their lives and communities around the natural ebb and flow of planting and harvest seasons. There is nothing new about seasonal farm jobs ending when harvest wraps up, or when other busy seasons come to a close.
This fall, some news outlets reported on “mass layoffs in Washington’s agriculture sector, giving the false impression of impending doom for certain farm businesses. It was a result of this wrongheaded law.
Now, not surprisingly, attorneys are reaching out to farmworkers who have been laid off, searching for paperwork errors they can exploit to sue farms.
Why were construction employers exempted from this requirement when farms were not? Why did lawmakers ignore the farming community’s plea to be left out of this burdensome legal structure designed for entirely different types of employment?
Washington’s new Mini-WARN law doesn’t benefit workers and puts farms in the crosshairs. 
Its requirements add work for family farms already suffocating under the weight of regulations. And it creates another opportunity for state fines, lawsuits from profiteering lawyers, false accusations from activists, and bad press.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska is suing six national nonprofits and a key funder of the organizations, alleging he and the groups illegally spent more than $10 million boosting progressive state ballot initiatives with “foreign money.” 
It is the first time the state has sued under a 2022 law the Legislature passed banning foreign nationals from funding ballot question campaigns in Nebraska.
State Attorney General Mike Hilgers, a Republican, announced Wednesday that his civil attorneys had traced money from Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss given to American nonprofit organizations and found that they had helped seven ballot initiatives by passing the donated money through local nonprofit groups that advocate for related issues in the state. 
The national nonprofits named in the lawsuit are the Wyss Foundation, Sixteen Thirty Fund, Berger Action Fund, New Venture Fund, Hopewell Fund and The Fairness Project. Hilgers said the groups had sent more than $10 million into the state since mid-2022, including $8 million in 2024 alone.

A spokesperson for the Wyss Foundation and Berger Action Fund said the allegations by the attorney general are “false.”
“We are confident the facts will demonstrate that the Wyss Foundation and Berger Action Fund have always complied with the law,” the spokesperson said. 
The Fairness Project declined to comment. Sixteen Thirty Fund, New Venture Fund and the Hopewell Fund did not immediately return messages seeking comment. 
The state filed the lawsuit in Madison County District Court, where it asked the Norfolk-based court to block the sued groups from funding future ballot campaigns directly or indirectly. 
The state lawsuit alleges that Nebraska advocacy nonprofits were used as pass-throughs for the money, including anti-poverty group Nebraska Appleseed and voting-rights organization Civic Nebraska. The local groups were not sued. 
Appleseed, reached Wednesday, declined to comment on the litigation. A spokesman for Civic Nebraska had no immediate comment. 
“The idea that we shouldn’t have foreign funding in our local elections is something that cuts across party lines and ideological lines,” Hilgers said.

Wyss has been considered a major force in Democratic politics nationally, donating to numerous causes. The Wyss Foundation also invested in journalism projects to expand environmental journalism at the Los Angeles Times.
The Wyss Foundation also donated to States Newsroom, the parent organization of the Nebraska Examiner. The foundation is among the listed donors on the States Newsroom website who have contributed more than $1,000 and listed on its 990 tax forms. Annual fundraising exceeds $20 million to support nonprofit news operations in 39 states.
States Newsroom has said it follows all laws regarding nonprofits and does not accept donations from foreign-based entities. Donors don’t dictate news-related decisions.
While Hilgers said he hadn’t seen the same type of foreign money spent on ballot initiatives he considered conservative, dark money in political campaigns has been an issue for both Democrats and Republicans in Nebraska. 
Former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Nebraska Republican, for example, was convicted of lying to federal investigators in a case stemming from taking money from a Lebanese billionaire for his 2016 congressional campaign. The conviction was later overturned on a technicality, and the second Trump administration opted not to try to prosecute him again.
Hilgers said he has no intention of using his lawsuit to upend ballot measures that voters have already approved.

Nebraska has seen a wave of progressive ballot measures, including increasing the minimum wage, requiring companies to pay sick leave and legalizing medical marijuana that passed in recent years. 
Sixteen Thirty Fund, the Fairness Project and Hopewell Fund gave a combined $2.25 million to the paid-sick-leave campaign, Hilgers’ lawsuit alleges. New Venture Fund, Hopewell Fund and the Fairness Project gave a combined $4.65 million to the abortion-rights initiative, the lawsuit alleges. Some of the groups gave nearly $190,000 to the anti-school-voucher initiative campaign, the suit claims. And one gave $100,000 to the medical-cannabis effort.
A mostly conservative group of state lawmakers in the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Legislature often brought up out-of-state funding of the ballot initiatives when pushing back against some of what voters approved in the last legislative session, including efforts to weaken sick leave protections.
While federal election law bans foreign nationals from spending on federal, state and local elections, a Federal Election Commission ruling from 2021 found that foreign nationals could contribute to ballot initiative committees in states. 
Thirteen states, including Nebraska, have banned direct and indirect contributions from foreign nationals to ballot measure campaigns at the state level. Another six states ban foreign nationals from directly contributing.

Cottonwood Heights Democratic Rep. Gay Lynn Bennion, who has represented District 41 for five years, is poised to become Cottonwood Heights’ new mayor, leading the race with 56% of votes, according to unofficial results on Wednesday. Current Mayor Mike Weichers is 13 percentage points behind.

The results are so far looking “pretty solid,” Bennion said on Wednesday. 
Bennion, still a house representative, will wait until election results are certified in about two weeks to resign from the Legislature. Then, District 41 Democratic delegates will choose a replacement to fill Bennion’s seat for the remaining year of her term.
“I just want (constituents) to know what an honor it has been to serve them in House District 41,” Bennion said, “Our House district has voted for Democratic women for the past 24 years, and I see excellent people that could take my spot, that our delegates will be able to choose from.”
Bennion highlighted her fight for housing affordability and water conservation issues at the state level. While her time in the Utah House “has been a joy,” she said she saw a need for a change of leadership in the mayor’s office. In particular, the city needs to improve its support to the Unified Fire Authority, which serves the city, and increase oversight of short-term rentals, she said.
“We have 500 plus unlicensed short-term rentals in our city because we’re right between the canyons,” Bennion said. “This is an issue that I’ve worked with our citizens for four years, and I tried to pass good statute from the state, but we can do that for our city and get this under control in a good way.”

However, she is sad to see voter turnout rates, she said, with thousands of people failing to cast a ballot in her district.
That was a pattern in counties across the state. Ryan Cowley, director of elections with the lieutenant governor’s office, estimates that turnout will be somewhere in the 30% range for most cities, with municipalities that had mayoral races faring a little better.
That’s substantially lower than the 86% statewide turnout Utah saw during last year’s general elections.  
For municipal elections, falling in the 30% range is expected, though “it’s really hard to compare municipal elections one year to the next, especially two-year cycles,” he said, since races are different for each city.
Election Day didn’t have any major highlights or problems, just “a few small things that come up,” Cowley said. Overall, it was a “pretty smooth and well-run election,” but voter turnout could still improve.
“(There were) a lot of close races. So when people say that their vote doesn’t matter, it really does,” Cowley said. “And to those who came out and turned out and voted, they got to express that choice. And to those that didn’t, their vote definitely would make a difference.”
Besides from Bennion’s likely win, it doesn’t seem like there will be much change at the Legislature as a result of this election.
Riverton Republican Sen. Daniel McCay had vowed to not run for reelection if his wife Tawnee McCay prevailed in the race for Riverton mayor. But, according to preliminary results Wednesday afternoon, Tawnee McCay, a Riverton City Council Member, only secured about 31% of votes, a wide gap from fellow Council Member Tish Buroker, who is ahead with 69% of votes.
In Provo, the race between incumbent Mayor Michelle Kaufusi and Marsha Judkins, who left the Utah House last year, remained tight as of Wednesday afternoon. According to unofficial results, Kaufusi is leading with 50.6% of votes, a 162-ballot advantage over Judkins who had 49.3% of votes.

Trey Jones, LSU’s lead attorney, said he does not believe the workgroups to be subcommittees subject to the state’s Open Meetings Law. 
“It’s a little different,” Jones said. “We’re relying on expertise of people, and not so much a committee that’s gathering its own information in an open setting, voting on what to bring to this committee.” 
“These work groups will come up and bring things that will either be rejected or accepted by the larger group,” Jones added. 
The process is similar to how other public bodies work. For example, a Louisiana House of Representatives committee might approve a bill, but it still needs to be considered the full House. Legislative committee meetings must be open to the public. 
“If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck,” First Amendment attorney Scott Sternberg said, “a subgroup or a working group, or whatever you like, if it’s a division of a larger public body, that’s a committee.” 
“If a majority of the committee is at the same place working on something from the transition committee, that’s a [public] meeting,” he added. 
The 11 workgroups will study academics, athletics, governance, student services, real estate, administration and enrollment, finance and human relations, research and economic development, IT and systems, marketing and communications, and external affairs and fundraising. 
Each workgroup is made up of about 10 members. LSU spokesman Todd Woodward has not yet provided a list of who will make up each workgroup. 
Only the 19 members of the Transition Committee’s executive committee have been posted online. They include Percy “Master P” Miller, a rap mogul who is now president of basketball operations at UNO, chef Emeril Lagasse Jr., retired shipyard owner Boysie Bollinger and three members of the LSU Board of Supervisors. 
The transfer of the university is scheduled to take effect July 1, 2026. After the workgroups submit their recommendations Dec. 5, the full committee will meet again in January, February and May.

Immigrants without legal status who have been detained undergo processing at the facility.  (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)As masked and costumed protesters demonstrate outside federal immigration facilities nationwide, the federal government has sped up the start of a new rule that may expose those protesters to fines and additional penalties.
Under the new rule, which took effect Wednesday, those fines can apply to people who commit crimes near federal property as well as on it, giving the Department of Homeland Security what it calls “enhanced charging authority.” 
The agency said the intent of the change is “to address violations occurring both on and off property to the extent it affects federal property and the persons thereon.”
The rule had been scheduled to take effect Jan. 1, but on Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska, a member of the local U.S. Attorney’s office requested a court order to implement a new list of fines for minor offenses under the rule.
In a court filing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Seth Beausang wrote: “The United States Attorney’s Office was informed today that the effective date of the regulations … may be advanced to November 5, 2025.”
Federal officials said there will be similar filings in other courts across the country during the coming days and weeks as the federal government implements the rule, which was proposed in the final days of the Biden administration and finalized in June under the Trump administration.
After an inquiry by the Alaska Beacon on Tuesday morning, the Department of Homeland Security issued a news release saying that the accelerated timeline is intended “to address a recent surge in security and public safety threats.”
“DHS is using every tool possible to protect the lives of our law enforcement as they face a surge in violence and lawlessness at many of our federal facilities,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the news release. “We’ve seen rampant violence against law enforcement including our officers shot at, rammed by vehicles, assaulted and threatened.”
Some of the items on the list of fines are simple updates of the current list, which was enacted in 2014.
There are new additions as well.
The fine schedule includes a $500 penalty for “obstructing the usual use, enjoyment or access to federal property.” 
In Chicago, several people — including Democratic U.S. House candidate Kat Abughazaleh — have already been accused of federal crimes for allegedly blocking vehicles outside a federal immigration facility. 
In Portland, protesters have taken to wearing inflatable costumes and other outlandish outfits outside of the city’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement building. The new fine schedule calls for a $200 penalty for “wearing a mask, hood, disguise or device that conceals the identity of the wearer when attempting to avoid detection or identification while violating any federal, state or local law, ordinance or regulation.”
While implementation of the new fines was sped up since the start of protests outside immigration facilities this year, the new proposal was actually written before those protests began.
They were drafted during the Biden administration by the General Services Administration, which operates federal buildings, and the Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Protective Service, which coordinates security.
In the January notice that proposed the new fines, the agencies said that DHS will “more effectively effectuate crowd management by citing and releasing criminal actors rather than requiring an arrest and detention.”
The new fines cover “approximately 8,500 federal facilities,” according to the Federal Register notice, and — in another change from prior practice — apply “to criminal misconduct that occurs on the federal property and adjacent off-property misconduct that … affects, threatens, or endangers the federal property and its occupants.”
That may have significant implications for the current immigration-facility protests. 
Until now, federal citations have been filed almost entirely for actions on federal property, leading to unusual standoffs in Portland and other places where protests have taken place directly adjacent to the federal property line.

Democrats Alicia Johnson and Peter Hubbard delivered an upset Tuesday by gaining over 60% of the statewide vote each, unseating two Republican incumbents on the Public Service Commission and clinching the first non-federal statewide victories for Democrats in Georgia in nearly 20 years. Johnson and Hubbard’s victories will reshape the current all-Republican commission, though the panel will remain under GOP control. 
Johnson and Hubbard won by focusing their campaigns on energy affordability, citing six Georgia Power bill increases over two years that were approved by the current commission and pledging to help lower energy costs. Democratic Party of Georgia Chairman Charlie Bailey attributed Tuesday night’s results to a “repudiation of Republican leadership” that raised people’s bills by an average of $500 a year.
“When Republicans get power, they use that power to enrich themselves, their buddies, big corporations and billionaires. And what the people of Georgia are saying, what they said last night, is that they’re not going to put up with it anymore,” Bailey said.
Democrats flip two seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission

The central theme Democrats credit for their success is a focus on the financial strain voters are experiencing. Democrats also won governorships in both New Jersey and Virginia by focusing on addressing affordability.
“American voters delivered a blue sweep, and make no mistake, the Democratic Party is back,” said Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin in a press conference Wednesday. “The Democratic Party is a party of affordability, and the Democratic Party is full steam ahead to take back Congress next year.”
Looking ahead, Martin said the party would be “all gas, no brakes” in pursuing major pick-up opportunities in governor’s races in 2026, specifically naming Georgia. Gov. Brian Kemp is term-limited and cannot run again next year, leaving the seat up for grabs. 
Georgia Republicans are wrestling with how to move on. Georgia Republican election strategist Brian Robinson, who worked on now-outgoing Commissioner Fitz Johnson’s campaign, said Georgia Republicans will need to center their messaging on affordability if they want the strongest chance of holding onto power after next year’s midterms.
“The margins are gobsmacking, and the margins make it impossible to brush it off with easy explanations,” he said. “I mean, this margin is a five-alarm fire, and Republicans have got to bring out the emergency brigades, and I think we need to be very focused in 2026 on affordability.”
Georgia Republicans can’t control what comes out of Washington, he added, but they can control how they interact with voters – including listening to what they have to say.
“We know it ain’t just energy. It’s just that energy was the thing they got to have a voice on this week. If there was a referendum on grocery prices, on housing prices, I think we would see a similar protest. We would see a similar frustration. That’s what I see here, an anti-incumbent more than an anti-Republican mood,” Robinson said. 
Robinson said he expects that anti-incumbent mood to still be around by next year, but he is optimistic his party can win if they bring their A game and have the “best political athletes on the field.” Having the “R” behind the name will not be enough in 2026, he said. 
“If Democrats think this means they’re going to win next year, they’re wrong,” he said. “But Republicans can’t believe that it doesn’t mean anything.”
Municipal elections in cities like Atlanta left Republicans at a disadvantage from the jump, said Kennesaw State University political science professor and former Cobb County GOP chairman Jason Shepherd.
“If you look across the board, most Republican voters do not live in incorporated areas, and many of them didn’t even know there was an election,” he said. “And let’s also face facts. Maybe here incumbency did not work out in their favor because people are pretty angry about year after year after year rate hikes. And it’s hard to explain to your average voter that ‘Hey, Georgia has one of the lowest energy costs in the nation.’ That’s not a great argument because it doesn’t matter what Alabama’s paying. It only matters what you’re paying from your own budget every month, and that’s going up.”
Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia, said that even if the election were held under normal circumstances, it would still have been a competitive election for Democrats because some voters are so dissatisfied with President Donald Trump. For Republicans, Bullock said, the path to future victories involves a delicate balancing act with the party’s base.
“They likely position themselves as Brian Kemp did, so you don’t criticize Trump, but on the other end, you try to make it clear to voters that you are not simply Trump’s man here,” Bullock said.
For Charles Hua of PowerLines, who called Tuesday night’s result both “shocking and unsurprising,” the Georgia election was a real-life experiment on how voters respond to messaging on energy affordability. The results in Georgia signaled a “seismic change” in energy politics that is resonating nationwide, he said, adding that electricity and gas are now among the fastest drivers of inflation.
To win in future races, Hua said that candidates must do two things: “One, name the issue, and two, take action on the issue.” While the outgoing Republican incumbents touched on affordability issues, Hua said their message wasn’t well communicated against a backdrop of rate increases under the incumbent commission. Regardless of party, candidates must “prioritize utility affordability and … articulate a clear, coherent policy plan” to tackle rising costs if they want to reach voters.
“The Public Service Commission is supposed to serve the public. It’s supposed to serve the public interest,” Hua said. “Somewhere along the way, we lost sight of that consumer vision.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC0876-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-05 20:01:00.810482

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)President Donald Trump released a slew of endorsement posts for 2026 Congressional candidates on his social media network Truth Social on Monday, a full year out from the election.
Trump’s endorsements included posts supporting Montana’s two Republican representatives, Ryan Zinke, who is serving his second term representing the state’s western district, and Troy Downing, who was first elected to represent the eastern district last November.


Zinke served as Secretary of the Interior for a stint during Trump’s first administration, and returned to politics in 2022 when Montana gained a second congressional seat following the census redistricting.
“Ryan continues to fight hard in Congress to Keep our now very Secure Border, SECURE, Stop Migrant Crime, Ensure LAW AND ORDER, Strengthen our Incredible Military/Veterans, Cut Taxes and Regulations, Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A., Champion American Energy DOMINANCE, and Defend our always under siege Second Amendment,” Trump wrote.
Downing is a former state auditor who won a crowded primary to replace former Montana Rep. Matt Rosendale, who did not run for re-election.


“Troy bravely served our Great Country in the U.S. Air Force as a Combat Veteran and, in Congress, he is fighting tirelessly to Support our Farmers and Ranchers, Champion American Energy DOMINANCE by helping to keep the price of Gasoline, Oil, and all forms of Energy VERY LOW (CHEAP!), Help Secure our now VERY Secure (Record Setting!) Southern Border, Strengthen our Military/Veterans, Defend our always under siege Second Amendment, which has not been attacked, amended, or changed while I was President, and Restore PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH,” Trump wrote.
All endorsed candidates have Trump’s “Complete and Total Endorsement.”
Candidate filing for 2026 races in Montana opens on Jan. 8, 2026, and closes on March 31.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)During his fifth “tele-Town Hall” meeting, Montana Congressman Troy Downing, who represents the central and eastern portion of the state, spoke about the federal government shutdown, healthcare, and said he’s stood up to the Trump administration in the face of a plan to quadruple imports of Argentinian beef.
At one point during the Wednesday electronic meeting, 14,000 people had tuned into the forum where Downing answered constituents’ questions for about 40 minutes, after introductory and closing remarks.
As he spoke about the longest federal shutdown in U.S. history, Downing said the effects on the Treasure State ranging from $177 million per month that the federal government provides in terms of economic support, as well as less obvious things like help from the Small Business Administration, which totals $12 million.
Downing told constituents that Republicans in the U.S. House had passed a “clean” continuing resolution to keep the government funded for seven weeks to negotiate a deal on expiring healthcare subsidies, a topic of concern for several of the callers on Wednesday.
He said that he and other Republicans want to have a conversation about healthcare, but he is unwilling to write a $1.5 trillion “blank check” that would have continued the subsidies because of his concern about fraud, waste and abuse, as well as not ferreting out the root cause of rising healthcare costs.
“We need to figure out the solution in the underlying system without writing a blank check that just is a smoke screen that hides the fundamental flaws in it,” Downing said.
Downing also defended his decision to vote in favor of the “big, beautiful bill” earlier this year which eliminated the subsidies, saying that they were never meant to be permanent, and that the Medicaid and Medicare funding in Montana would not suffer as a result.
“The ‘big, beautiful bill,’ there’s been tremendous misconception about how that affects Medicaid. And in Montana, the effect is minimum. Will I remove funding from Medicaid? I mean, to the extent that it’s paying for fraudulent transactions, 100%,” Downing said.  “But to the effect that it is affecting patient care for people who are entitled those benefits, absolutely not. Our goal was to make sure that we were dealing with the fraud, waste and abuse, making sure that people who were gaming the system were no longer being paid for by taxpayers, and making sure everybody who is entitled still has a path to have those entitlements. So far, the data that we’ve dug up and the changes made in the ‘One big, beautiful bill’ affecting Medicare and Medicaid should have a de minimus to zero effect on Montana.”
  Argentina, beef and Montana 

Several callers expressed concern about how the Trump administration’s policy on tariffs and especially Argentina would play out for Montana ranchers and farmers.
One caller, identified as Jared from Billings, asked why Downing and the other members of the state’s Congressional delegation didn’t push harder against the Trump administration.
“Why are you, and as well as any of our other delegation from Montana, not out there challenging the President and this administration on these policies that are going to hurt Montana? Why aren’t you saying, ‘Hey, I’m from Montana, and I work for the people of Montana, and this is wrong, and we need to change this?’” Jared asked.
Downing pushed back on that characterization, and said he and other Congress members sent a letter to the White House.
“I wholeheartedly disagree, because as soon as the rumor came out about (Argentinian beef), I was on the phone with the administration talking about the issues, and then I was at a call with my colleagues in other states that also have ranching communities, and we started talking about how we wanted to get this message through the president,” Downing said. “So we signed a joint letter that we sent to the White House, and that joint letter was made public. It came out in press releases. It was linked on our social media, and it got nationwide press. My message to the administration is that the solution to the prices of beef in the grocery store is not going to be born on the backs of our producers in Montana. I said what we need to do is we need to give them the tools and the time to rebuild the whole herd and not simply start opening, you know, Pandora’s box of increasing foreign imports.”
  National headlines, local concerns 

Callers on the forum also questioned Downing about issues that were happening far away from Big Sky country, including the Epstein files to boats being bombed in the Caribbean.
One resident asked Downing whether he’d commit to fully releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files, and Downing reiterated the position he took in a previous town hall: He supported the continuing investigations, and wanted all the perpetrators named, but stopped short of endorsing a full release because of victims.
“We all want to see the perpetrators pay for their crimes. We want to make sure that people are held accountable, and I am all about making sure that every bit of information about the perpetrators is made public,” Downing said. “What I’m worried about is the thousand victims who moved on with their life, and whose families may not know about this. They’ve moved on, and don’t want to be in the public eye. And we need to be very careful that we do no harm, that we hold those who are guilty accountable for these, you know, horrendous acts.”
Another caller questioned whether the Trump administration should be using military forces to blow up or destroy smaller ships in the Caribbean without Congressional approval.
“There’s obviously some current concerns to make sure that these actions are appropriate,” Downing said.
Downing, who said he’s never been involved in a secure briefing about the situation, still backed the Trump administration, saying that “narcoterrorists” were flooding the nation and that the president had powers granted through Article II of the federal constitution that allowed him to act unilaterally.
He also told callers that he trusted U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio when he’s said publicly that U.S. forces have known who is on those boats and what those boats were transporting.
  Other issues 

Downing also touched on other issues, including energy prices, and said that Montana needs to have an “all of the above” selection of solutions — a familiar refrain of Montana’s leaders. He touted his record supporting the Trump administration’s reopening much of the U.S. West to oil drilling and exploration as well as coal.
However, he said he was also concerned about the state’s aging transmission lines and what that could mean for the future.
Downing said he supported letting states like Montana handle their own artificial intelligence and data centers because those costs could get shifted to individual ratepayers.
“I think that we’ve seen cleaner cleaner fossil fuel burning power plants we’ve seen, you know, we’ve seen basically everything get more and more efficient. And I think that that is a good thing that we need to continue looking at, because if you have markets involved in needing to make things cheaper, cleaner better, then you’re going to start to see a lot of innovation in that space that really creates a lot of opportunity,” Downing said. “Both of those parts are are equally important, the reliability and the affordability. I just want to kind of dispel the myth that people say that both parties all hate each other and we’re all at each other’s throats. I mean, there are, you know, obviously some fire brands on both sides of the aisle, but most of us that just want to get policy done.”
 



  Public meetings or not? 

Rep. Troy Downing said that he’s held five electronic town halls since taking office as Montana’s Second District Representative. He said he continues to plan them about every other month.
And gauging by participation, when as many as 14,000 people joined on Wednesday, it was a large gathering. However, several participants asked about how public the first-term Republican had been while in the district, which spans two-thirds of the state.
Here’s a brief transcript that characterizes an increasingly common refrain from citizens across the nation who want more response and more public appearances from their elected Congressional leaders. The first of nine callers during Wednesday’s call began with the topic of open, public meetings.
CALLER: First of all, I’d like to thank Congressman downing for having this telephone telephone town hall. …  In your travels around the state, have you had any face to face town halls that are announced in advance so that people can come?
DOWNING: We’ve we’ve had small group with businesses and different groups, but we’ve not done a big, you know, like stadium kind of deal. We’ve just basically been doing these Teletown Halls just so we can hit more people at once.
CALLER: OK, so you have not gone to a town, announced that you’ll have a town hall and allow people to come meet with you face to face in all your travels? You have not done that. Is that correct?
DOWNING: Well, that’s not 100% correct, because we have met with a lot of folks who have posted it to their members, and like I said, it’s been schools, it’s been small businesses, it’s been farmers, but we have not called it ‘the town hall,’ but we have met and announced that we are meeting with constituents across the district, right?
CALLER: But not everyone was invited. You invited people to meet with you and you selected them. Is that correct?
DOWNING: That’s not correct. We allow the people who are hosting it to bring their members and the people from their community, OK?",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/trump-sheehy-34-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-05 19:17:23.347666

 “I am simply asking for my first chance. I don’t need a second,” Mohammed Rashid said, as he remains detained in Vermont while the government challenges the asylum decision.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Nearly a year after receiving asylum, a Palestinian man is still behind bars .","Receiving asylum is generally a lengthy process, spanning from several months to years. But Mohammed Rashid, a 29-year-old Palestinian man, was granted asylum only four months after arriving in the United States as a stowaway.  
It could have been the beginning of a new chapter for Rashid, who says he fled the Gaza Strip to escape Hamas’s clutches and was hoping to start a peaceful life here in the U.S., perhaps working in fashion and photography.
But nearly a year after being granted asylum, Rashid still hasn’t set foot out of detention. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement appealed the judge’s decision to grant him asylum. He has been held in recent months at Vermont’s Northwest State Correctional Facility in Saint Albans, and a hearing is set for Thursday in Chelmsford Immigration Court in Massachusetts.

People who have suffered persecution or fear being persecuted in their home countries can apply for asylum once they are in the United States. If they are granted asylum, they are protected from deportation. Asylees can eventually apply for permanent resident status and gain a path to citizenship.
“Before I came to the United States, I thought I could have peace here. All I want is to live in peace. I did not think I would be detained,” Rashid said, adding that he still can’t believe that he has been detained for 15 months. Rashid provided answers to VTDigger’s questions through one of his lawyers, Emma Matters-Wood, with the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project.
After being detained in Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, Rashid was transferred to Vermont at the end of August. It was then that attorneys with the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project met him for the first time during one of their regular legal trainings to inform people held in immigration detention of their rights.
The trainings are meant to provide a legal orientation so that people in detention can advocate for themselves at a time when immigration attorneys are handling a full caseload and often don’t have the capacity to represent more people. But Rashid’s case prompted them to make an exception.

“Mohammed was one of the last we met with that day, and his story shocked us to the core: just hearing how long he had been detained and the circumstances of that detainment,” said Andy Pelcher, an attorney working pro bono with VAAP.
Pelcher and Matters-Wood with VAAP and Nathan Virag, an attorney with the Association of Africans Living in Vermont, joined forces to represent him and immediately submitted a temporary restraining order to prevent ICE from transferring Rashid so that he could stay in Vermont while his case played out.
The lawyers filed a habeas corpus petition challenging the legitimacy of Rashid’s prolonged detention after he was granted asylum. They also argued that Rashid doesn’t pose a danger to the community, given he has no criminal record, and he’s not a flight risk because he has a legitimate fear of persecution in his home country and family ties in the United States.
‘Welcome to America’
Rashid was imprisoned and tortured by Hamas twice because Hamas wanted him to join them, according to Pelcher, one of the VAAP lawyers. Rashid refused to join Hamas as he didn’t want to participate in violence, the attorney said. He managed to flee Gaza in 2019, paying an Egyptian man to cross into Egypt.
He later applied for asylum in Germany. When that asylum was denied, he decided to leave for the United States, where he has siblings and other relatives.
After boarding a ship as a stowaway, Rashid arrived in July of 2024 in Rhode Island, where ICE took him into custody, court documents show.
U.S. immigration officers interviewed Rashid and confirmed that he did indeed possess a credible fear of persecution. This interview is a preliminary step in the asylum process to determine whether an applicant has a credible fear of torture or persecution if forced to return to their home country. An immigration judge granted him asylum a few months later, in early December of 2024, after hearing his case. 
“Normally, when somebody is granted asylum, that’s like winning the lottery,” Pelcher said. “Welcome to America, that’s your ticket, and that’s something that so many people strive for.”

But instead of allowing Rashid’s release, ICE filed an appeal one day after the 30-day window for doing so had elapsed and asked for Rashid’s continued detention while the appeal was pending. 
Ten months later, the case is still pending with the Board of Immigration Appeals.
The Department of Homeland Security didn’t answer VTDigger’s questions about Rashid’s case despite multiple emails. ICE referred VTDigger’s requests for comment to the Department of Justice, which, according to its website, is not monitoring media requests on a regular basis due to the government shutdown. 
According to Rashid’s lawyers, the reasons for the government’s appeal center on the money Rashid paid to leave Gaza, which the government claims shows support to a terrorist organization, and Rashid’s previous stay in Germany.
Emma Matters-Wood, one of Rashid’s lawyers, said the government alleges that the judge didn’t provide findings on whether the money Rashid paid to leave went to Hamas and whether that would constitute support to a terrorist organization. If someone knowingly provides material support to a terrorist organization, they are not eligible for asylum, as that violates one of the components of the Immigration and Nationality Act. 
But in fact, the government has already made that argument during Rashid’s asylum hearing, according to Matters-Wood. The immigration judge responded that it seemed unlikely Rashid had paid anyone in Hamas to leave, and besides, he would have had no way of knowing exactly who he was paying, his lawyer said. The judge recognized as common knowledge that people have to pay a fee to cross the border and decided to grant Rashid asylum despite the government’s argument, the lawyer said.
Additionally, Matters-Wood said the government claims that, since Rashid is a stateless person, the judge should consider his last country of residence, Germany, when deciding whether to grant his application for asylum. The government also argued that, before coming to the U.S., Rashid was firmly resettled in Germany, which would make him ineligible to receive asylum in the United States. When applying for asylum, a person is considered to be firmly resettled when, before arriving in the U.S., the person was in another state where they received an offer of permanent resident status or citizenship. 
But Matters-Wood said Rashid didn’t receive any permanent legal status in Germany, so that doesn’t qualify as firm resettlement. In asylum applications, the lawyer said, judges consider the persecution the person is fleeing, which in this case occurred in Gaza.
“This is the first case that I have worked on where someone has been granted asylum, and then the government has appealed, and they’ve been detained during that appeal,” said Matters-Wood. 
In most of the cases Matters-Wood has seen, the situation was reversed, she said: Her clients were not granted asylum and remained detained while they appealed the denial. 
Matters-Wood said the lawyers are not contesting the government’s initial detention of Rashid, which is standard process when someone arrives in the U.S. as a stowaway. Rather, they are arguing that his prolonged detention is unlawful and unjustified, given immigration officials’ initial conclusion he possessed a credible fear of persecution back home and a judge already granting him asylum.
According to court records, the government attorneys have argued that Rashid’s detention during the asylum proceeding, including during the appeal process, is both lawful and mandatory.
‘I just want to live in peace’
A lot has changed in Rashid’s life while he has been in detention.
Rashid’s uncle, Khalil Rasheed, who is a U.S. citizen and lives in Ohio, said Rashid’s dad died during the Israel-Hamas war. He said Rashid still has siblings in Gaza, and a mother, who is ill.
VTDigger could not interview Rashid directly because he’s in ICE detention. Instead, VTDigger submitted written questions to him through Matters-Wood, who asked him the questions during a visit at the prison. 
“I’ve had family die since being detained, and I was unable to speak to them. My mother is still in Gaza, probably on the streets somewhere by now,” he said. “I’m stuck in here, unable to help them. If I had no family, I could be locked up here all my life, and I feel like I could accept that, but with my family in Gaza or alone? No, I can’t accept it.”
Rashid is the youngest among his siblings, and he decided to leave Gaza to have freedom and a better future, his uncle said. 
“He has a lot of goals in his life to achieve,” Khalil Rasheed said. “He wants to be something. He wanted to be successful.”
Rashid is interested in fashion, he said, and has a background in photography. “I’d really like to work in fashion as a photographer,” he said. “I think I’d be really good at it.”
“I just want to live in peace,” Rashid said. “If I were released, I’d love to be with my sister.” 
A new bond hearing
At the end of September, Rashid’s lawyers requested that he be released on bond during a hearing at Chelmsford Immigration Court. Judge Natalie Smith denied the request, saying that she didn’t have jurisdiction to consider bond, according to Matters-Wood.
Matters-Wood said this was a result of a recent Board of Immigration Appeals decision in Matter of Yajure Hurtado, which significantly limited who is eligible for bond. According to this decision, immigration judges lack the authority to hear bond hearings for noncitizens who are present in the U.S. without admission, no matter how long they have been in the country. In most cases, admission consists of receiving a visa or prior authorization to enter the country, which many people coming to the U.S. in a humanitarian capacity don’t have.
Several federal district courts around the country have found that the decision is unconstitutional and immigration judges shouldn’t consider it during bond hearings, according to Matters-Wood.
Rashid’s lawyers requested that the U.S. District Court in Vermont allows them to provide supplemental briefing on the controversial Board of Immigration Appeals decision and how it impacted the judge’s decision in Rashid’s case in immigration court.
Last week, Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford in the Vermont court denied the request for supplemental briefing, explaining he didn’t think the Board of Immigration Appeals decision applied to Rashid, since he arrived as a stowaway. But he determined Rashid should have a second bond hearing in immigration court because of his prolonged detention.
In the new hearing, he requested the immigration judge to only consider flight risk and danger to the community as determining factors when deciding whether to grant bond, according to court documents.
“If Mr. Rashid is being detained despite the fact that he is neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community, the Government is erroneously depriving him of his freedom,” the judge stated. 
The judge pointed to the fact that Rashid was already granted asylum and passed criminal record checks and screening for potential national security risks. “In the absence of a legal error by the immigration judge, it is likely he will ultimately be allowed to remain in the United States,” he said.
The hearing is expected to be held on Thursday at Chelmsford Immigration Court. Crawford also said that the Department of Homeland Security should have considered Rashid for parole. In the case that the immigration judge denies bond, Crawford ordered the government to determine whether Rashid should receive parole within 10 days of the decision. The judge wrote that Rashid should not be transferred outside Vermont until his bond hearing or parole decision. 
“Being detained for as long as I have, I have seen so many people in here asking for a lawyer to help them get a second chance,” he said through Matters-Wood. “I am simply asking for my first chance. I don’t need a second.”

The First Alaskans Institute’s annual gala awards rarely get much attention outside of the black-tie fundraiser where they’re given.The honors typically go to people whose work has aligned with the organization’s mission of advocating for Alaska Native communities, and they’re usually a cause for celebration, not controversy.But this year, one of the awards has provoked intense pushback.
The high-profile Indigenous organization announced last week that an honor for non-Native people would be shared by John Shively.
Shively is a longtime player in Alaska government and political circles who helped lead and set up several prominent Native institutions.
He is also the chief executive of the company pushing the stalled Pebble mining project — a huge and contentious proposed mine that’s strongly opposed by many members of the state’s Native communities.

Pebble’s opponents quickly condemned the selection of Shively for the award. After the president of the First Alaskans Institute told him about the opposition, Shively declined the honor to “avoid harming” the organization, he said in a phone interview.
For the past week, First Alaskans Institute has been contending with the fallout, both from Pebble’s opponents and from supporters of Shively, who feel he was treated unfairly.
The institute is a nonprofit intended to advocate on behalf of the state’s Indigenous people. It was formed in 2000, spurred by a $20 million pledge from the oil industry.
Led by board members from around the state, the organization has long tried to straddle divergent interests within the Native community, and to work on unifying issues like cultural preservation and an annual gathering for elders and youth in Anchorage.
The response to Shively’s selection highlights how hard that job can be, particularly when tensions arise between pro-development and environmental interests — a conflict that sometimes shows up in the disparate missions of tribal governments and for-profit Alaska Native-owned corporations. The Alaska Federation of Natives, known as AFN, has contended with similar divisions in recent years, with both tribaland corporate members leaving the organization, though some have recently returned.
“Native people like those at First Alaskans and myself are kind of caught between the devil and the deep blue sea,” said Roy Huhndorf, a former AFN co-chair and former president of CIRI, the for-profit Native regional corporation for Anchorage and the surrounding area.
That tension, Huhndorf added, has existed since at least 1971, when Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act that created the for-profit Native-owned corporations.
Shively’s work in Alaska dates back to the 1960s and has ranged widely across multiple industries.
He served as an executive at Northwest Alaska’s regional Native corporation, NANA, where he helped advance development of the massive Red Dog mine — a project operated by a multinational company on NANA land in a partnership that has substantial support from the region’s Native community.
Shively also served as an executive at AFN and once worked as commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources. Early in his career in the state, he worked on rural economic development and healthcare. In 1992, AFN gave Shively a Denali award — an honor reserved for non-Native people who have shown “strong commitment, dedication, and service” to Native people and rural Alaska.
But in recent decades, Shively has become most known for his work on Pebble — one of Alaska’s most controversial proposed mines, given its massive size and proximity to the world’s largest wild sockeye salmon fishery, at Bristol Bay.
Pebble would be among the world’s largest copper, gold and molybdenum mines, and boosters say it could create much-needed jobs and generate important revenue for the state and rural Alaskans. It has the support of two local Alaska Native corporations.
But many powerful political interests in the Bristol Bay area, including the Native regional corporation and multiple tribal governments, oppose the project. They say the mine would threaten salmon runs that sustain a huge commercial harvest as well as rural subsistence fishermen and Indigenous culture in the region.
As Pebble’s chief executive, Shively has worked “in opposition to Native self-determination and sovereignty,” said Alannah Hurley, executive director of United Tribes of Bristol Bay, a regional tribal consortium that’s opposed to the proposed mine. She called the First Alaskans Institute award choice “really disappointing.”
Two days after announcing the award, First Alaskans Institute released a statement saying that, in response to feedback from its community, the organization had contacted Shively to discuss the matter. He “graciously expressed appreciation for the recognition,” but “ultimately chose to decline the award,” the statement said.
Shively has worked extensively over the years with some  Alaska Native leaders, including the chair of the First Alaskans Institute’s board, Willie Hensley. Hensley was an early leader at NANA and has served on an advisory committee for Pebble. He also sits on the board of a mining company, Trilogy Metals, that’s advancing a project near the end of another controversial development, the proposed Ambler road.
Hensley could not be reached for comment, and First Alaskans Institute’s staff declined to comment.  Shively, in an interview, said the institute’s president, Roy Agloinga, had told him that the organization had received more opposition than it had expected after announcing the award.
Shively said he’s used to criticism, so the backlash didn’t come as a complete surprise to him. But the ordeal has been  “hurtful” to his family, he added.
In a since-deleted press release announcing that Shively had declined the award, First Alaskans Institute said its mission encompasses both resource development and conservation.
“We acknowledge and respect the many long-term contributions made by this individual,” the release said. “At the same time, we remain mindful of the concern among members of our community.”

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The federal government will allow the state of North Dakota to regulate the handling of waste from coal-burning power plants. 
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, Gov. Kelly Armstrong and other officials announced Wednesday that the EPA has approved the state’s coal combustion residuals permit program.
Coal combustion residuals, or CCRs, are waste such as fly ash and other types of ash. Some can be recycled into concrete or wallboard.
Republican U.S. Sen. John Hoeven pointed to a bill he helped author to allow states to develop coal waste recycling programs. 
Coal ash was used in the construction of the North Dakota Heritage Center and the National Energy Center of Excellence at Bismarck State College, according to the news release.
Fly ash also is a potential source of rare earth minerals. 
“The potential to extract rare earth elements and critical minerals from CCR — instead of having to import them from foreign adversaries — makes this approval of our CCR permit program even more important to U.S. energy independence, the economy and national security,” Armstrong said. 
North Dakota is the fourth state to be granted the permitting authority. 
Trump signs orders targeting revival of ‘beautiful, clean coal’

The Dakota Resource Council is among the environmental groups opposed to state regulation of coal combustion residuals, saying North Dakota has a history of ignoring environmental issues. 
Executive Director Scott Skokos called it “a free pass for coal companies to police themselves” in a news release.
Environmental groups say coal waste landfills can leak and pollute groundwater. Coal ash spills in Tennessee and North Carolina caused extensive environmental damage.  
“Once groundwater is polluted, there’s no going back,” Skokos said. 
Western North Dakota has five coal-fired power plants. The lignite coal industry supports about 12,000 jobs in North Dakota. 
“This announcement demonstrates confidence in North Dakota’s leadership and technical expertise, reinforcing what we’ve long known: local knowledge and accountability lead to the best outcomes for both the environment and the economy,”  Jonathan Fortner, president and CEO of the Lignite Energy Council, said in a statement. 
Zeldin said the move helps cut red tape and puts more decision-making in the hands of the state, where it belongs. 
“States should be more in charge of their own destiny,” Zeldin said. 
Armstrong said the change gives North Dakota more control and flexibility. 
“When you impose a federal regulation, 4,600 pages or otherwise … it’s almost impossible to change that if new technology comes out, or better technology comes out,” Armstrong said.

He said the change to state-level management of the coal waste will be “less restrictive, and more outcome-based.”
In an interview after the press conference, Dave Glatt, director of the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality, said North Dakota established a program to monitor coal waste in the 1990s. He said the state submitted its application for state authority during President Joe Biden’s administration.
“It’s just taken this long and, quite frankly, it shouldn’t have taken that long,” Glatt said. “When I talk to EPA now, they said it should’ve taken six months because we had a very well-established program that really checked off all the boxes.”
Glatt said he doesn’t see a need for much change to what the state is already doing, but the agency may have additional reporting requirements for the EPA. The department already inspects monitoring well sites near coal waste landfills several times per year, he said. He said the department will not need additional staff. 
“I don’t think we’re going to need any more people, because we’ve already been at it for decades,” Glatt said

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Gov. Kim Reynolds announced Wednesday the state submitted an application for a new “Healthy Hometowns” initiative that could bring in more than $1 billion for rural health care over five years.
The state applied to the federal Rural Health Transformation Program, an initiative managed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, that was created by the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” to provide funding for projects addressing health care shortages in rural communities.
This $50 billion fund, intended to dispense $10 billion annually for rural hospitals between 2026 and 2030, was created in part due to concerns that rural hospitals already facing financial struggles could close because of the cuts to Medicaid included in the budget reconciliation law.

The “Healthy Hometowns” initiative proposed by Iowa for the program requests $200 million per project year from the fund, totaling $1 billion over the five-year period. The state’s proposal for these funds was created in collaboration with rural hospitals, health systems and community partners, according to a news release from Reynolds, by developing a “hub and spoke” model of care to address health care shortages in rural Iowa communities.
In the application, the state lays out six areas of focus for improving rural health care outcomes and accessibility, including developing “Health Hubs” and expanding existing Centers of Excellence with access to specialized care and equipment, providing more incentives for health care professionals to practice in rural communities, increasing cancer screenings and treatment. The proposal also aims to streamline some aspects of health care, like the process of exchanging health records, coordinating community health workers’ care, and creating more mobile health services options.
Reynolds said in a statement the initiative would further her administration’s work on supporting rural health care access.
“Since taking office, my administration has emphasized the importance of supporting and revitalizing rural Iowa through targeted investments and policy initiatives,” Reynolds said. “Rural communities are the backbone of our state — home to nearly half of all Iowans and the foundation of our economy, culture, and identity. Healthy Hometowns is a pivotal opportunity to build a high quality, sustainable system of care that vastly improves health, well-being, and quality of life for rural Iowans.”
Some of the “Healthy Hometowns” proposals were included in Reynolds’ 2025 law focused on rural health care. In addition to directing the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services to create a “hub and spoke” model across the state, the measure also called for the department to draw down $150 million in federal funding to create 115 new residency slots at Iowa teaching hospitals, and to change to Iowa Medicaid rates for health care providers serving mothers and infants.
Iowa HHS Director Larry Johnson said the application to the federal government for this project “reflects years of thoughtful planning and collaboration” on how to address rural communities’ health care needs throughout the state.
“It’s a plan rooted in the values of hard work, innovation, and community,” Johnson said in a statement. “Iowans deserve a health care system designed for them — and with Healthy Hometowns, we’re delivering just that.”
State awards for the federal program are expected to be released Dec. 31, 2025 according to the news release.
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Rob Sand also held an event Wednesday where he discussed rural health care needs. Medical professionals at the Newton roundtable called for the state to expand medical residency slots and change loan repayment programs, as well as saying the state’s six-week abortion ban has made it more difficult to recruit or retain maternal health care providers in the state.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Smithfield Public Schools Superintendent Dawn Bartz is on paid administrative leave, the town’s School Committee announced Wednesday.
The announcement from School Committee Chair Richard Iannitelli arrived less than 48 hours after a marathon meeting at Smithfield High School attended by hundreds of people from the community. The committee met Monday night for three hours in closed session with Bartz before emerging for a unanimous vote to hire an outside legal team to conduct an investigation into an alleged antisemitic hazing incident among football players in the boys’ locker room.
“Superintendent Dawn Bartz is on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of a legal review regarding the administration’s recent handling of a football matter,” Iannitelli’s statement read. “These steps ensure continued stability and focus on the needs of our students, staff, and families.”
Smithfield Town Manager Robert Seltzer said Iannitelli told him that Bartz is “on voluntary paid leave until further notice.” 
“Chair Iannitelli stated that the Committee will not be commenting further at this time,” Sean Clough, the district’s attorney, said in an email.
The Sept. 30 incident discussed at Monday’s meeting involved five senior football players in the boys’ locker room, and a Jewish freshman. The freshman was allegedly locked in a bathroom, sprayed with Lysol through a grate in the door, and taunted with antisemitic slurs. 
The seniors were suspended from the team around Oct. 10. Bartz’s role in the controversy stems largely from her having un-suspended the five seniors on Oct. 22, after they appealed their suspensions. 
There has been no public explanation for the reinstatements from the district, Bartz or the school committee. On Monday night, the School Committee explained that it could not divulge much more information, as the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office is also investigating the case. The school district has until Nov. 13 to send materials requested by the AG’s office.
‘What do I say?’
The Jewish Alliance of Greater Rhode Island and the Sandra Bornstein Holocaust Education Center — two organizations pressing for more public answers about the incident — released a joint statement Wednesday that they felt “encouraged that action has been taken” and that Bartz being placed on leave “is a significant step, and we await further details on this development.” 
 “We hope this creates an opportunity to resume the education process with the school to ensure this never happens again,” the statement reads.
Smithfield Town Council President John J. Tassoni said in a phone interview Wednesday that he understood Bartz elected to take a leave, which he described as “a good idea at this particular point.” 
Tassoni critiqued Bartz’s reinstatement of the players and said they should have been benched while a possible investigation was in the works.
“As a former union leader,” Tassoni said, “if someone had an issue, you’re out pending the investigation. You’re not out permanently, without an investigation.”

Bartz’s decision to reverse course was “the most disturbing part of this whole thing” for Tassoni, who added, “I think what she did to the town of Smithfield has fragmented the town. It will be a long time before it’s repaired.”
Tassoni, who is president of the Substance Use and Mental Health Leadership Council of Rhode Island, said he went to a conference Wednesday where people asked him, “What the hell is going on in Smithfield?”
“I mean, what do I say?” he said. “This is what I say: I don’t know. I don’t have any information.”
Tassoni described a “line in the sand” between the all Republican School Committee and the five-member Town Council, which has three Democrats and two Republicans. That boundary has stemmed the flow of information between the two bodies in Tassoni’s view.
“The Town Council’s been in the dark through this whole fiasco, and it’s really unfortunate,” Tassoni said.
Tassoni said he and Iannitelli last spoke when they discussed and agreed to cancel an Oct. 28 joint meeting. Tassoni said he didn’t want the meeting’s non-educational and financial contents to be overshadowed by the controversy.

The reason for reinstating the players is unclear. It is unlikely that neither the players’ suspension or reinstatement affected the Sentinels’ chances to reach the playoffs in their Division IV league. The team had a strong 3-1 record even before the players were suspended on Oct. 10.
The players were reinstated on Oct. 22, two days before Senior Night, the last home game of the season where outgoing seniors are celebrated on their home turf. The Sentinels secured a 16-6 victory over the Exeter-West Greenwich Scarlet Knights that Friday evening.
The Smithfield Sentinels closed the season with a 5-2 league record. They also won their only game which happened while the five players were suspended, with the Sentinels defeating the Juanita Sanchez Complex Cavaliers 14-6 on Oct. 18. 
The team’s next matchup is a playoff game at home on Friday, against the Scituate Spartans. 
The attorney for the senior students’ families, Gregory Piccirilli, did not respond to a request for comment from Rhode Island Current, but did tell the Boston Globe that, “We don’t want any adverse action against anyone.”
“What we have wanted is public clarity from the administration that the boys neither admitted to nor engaged in any antisemitic behavior, and that there is no evidence supporting the accusation,” Piccirilli told the Globe.
Smithfield Assistant Superintendent Lisa Odom‑Villella will serve in Bartz’s stead as acting superintendent. Odom-Villella has been with the district for about six months, and was previously deputy commissioner at the Rhode Island Department of Education, according to her LinkedIn profile.

Gavin Newsom's Proposition 50, which will tilt the state's congressional districts toward Democrats in the 2026 election. Now comes the scramble: Who runs where?","In summary
California voters passed Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Proposition 50, which will tilt the state’s congressional districts toward Democrats in the 2026 election. Now comes the scramble: Who runs where?


Three months ago, conventional wisdom suggested that Gov. Gavin Newsom’s redistricting plan faced a brutal uphill battle amid an impromptu 10-week campaign sprint. 
But within minutes after polls closed at 8 p.m. Tuesday, The Associated Press and national news networks had already proclaimed that Proposition 50 would pass handily, with voters agreeing to temporarily suspend California’s independently drawn maps and adopt ones gerrymandered in favor of Democrats. 
Prop. 50’s landslide victory proved that Newsom and his allies bet correctly on pitching the measure as a countermaneuver to gerrymanders by Republican states such as Texas and an act of resistance against President Donald Trump.
It also spells the beginning of the end for several of California’s Republican House members, who now must make the unpleasant calculation of whether to run in their current district, switch to a new seat or drop out entirely — questions they could previously dodge under the guise of “Prop. 50 won’t pass.”
But it’s not yet clear how widely Prop. 50’s influence will stretch outside of California. The five-seat gain for Democrats could offset at least some redistricting efforts in Republican states, although Republicans stand to gain more seats from an all-out redistricting arms race. 
Then there’s the looming possibility that the U.S. Supreme Court will outlaw the use of race in the redistricting process, which could give Republicans a major advantage in Southern states. 
Opponents also haven’t given up, despite losing at the ballot box. 
Just over 12 hours after polls closed, California Republicans announced a lawsuit challenging Prop. 50 in a Fresno-based federal court on the grounds that it violates the 14th and 15th Amendments by drawing districts that favor Latino voters at the expense of other ethnic and racial groups. 
All the while, incumbents and challengers on both sides of the aisle are scrambling to mark their turf in whichever newly drawn district they think will give them the best chance of winning, which could lead to some tense and expensive intra-party matchups. 
As all eyes turn to 2026, here are five key takeaways from Prop. 50’s success and what comes next:
Democrats leveraged Trump and national politics
Newsom repeatedly told Californians that a vote for Prop. 50 was a vote against Trump. 
It worked.
Droves of Democratic voters who were hungry to “do something” meaningful to fight back against what they perceived as an out-of-control Trump administration weighed in on a single-issue ballot measure. With thousands of outstanding ballots still to count, the measure was leading by a 64% to 36% margin Wednesday. Secretary of State Shirley Weber said there was “huge turnout” in person Tuesday night, with long lines wrapping around buildings at many polling sites. 
The nationalization of the campaign, which harnessed many Californians’ palpable fear of and disgust with the actions coming out of Washington, drowned out the good governance case that Prop. 50 opponents tried to push. 
Absent the “Trump effect,” an argument against gerrymandering likely would have played well in California, a state that just 15 years ago voted to take map-drawing powers away from politicians and give them to citizens.
The opposition lacked money and a clear message
While the Yes campaign focused on antagonizing Trump, the opposition steered clear of the president and settled instead on a California-focused good governance message that avoided national politics altogether. 
To Cathy Abernathy, a Bakersfield-based Republican political operative and longtime mentor of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, that was a big mistake. 
“The word was, ‘Well, don’t make it about Trump,’” Abernathy said. “Why in the world aren’t we making it all about Trump?” she added. “Trump didn’t even campaign here for president and got 40% of the vote.”

Abernathy also criticized the state Republican Party for its sloppy get out the vote mailing blitz, which wasted precious money by failing to target only voters who hadn’t yet returned their ballots, sending mailers to thousands of people who had already voted. She placed the blame on consultants who cared more about making money than winning elections.
“I just don’t think there’s respect for the money donated to the party by the people that are spending the money,” she said.
Let the musical chairs begin
Now that voters have approved Prop. 50, a major shuffle is underway as some incumbents scramble to preserve their careers in newly redistricted seats while challengers jockey for the chance to unseat them. 
Five congressional Republicans in California, Reps. Doug LaMalfa, Kevin Kiley, David Valadao, Ken Calvert and Darrell Issa, face much steeper challenges to retaining their seats. And on the defensive side, five incumbent Democrats — Reps. Adam Gray, Josh Harder, Dave Min, Derek Tran and George Whitesides — have seen their seats grow safer. 
Among the incumbents switching districts is Calvert, who for more than 30 years has represented a Riverside County district that was redrawn eastward into Los Angeles County. He announced Wednesday that he would instead run for reelection in the neighboring 40th District, setting up an intraparty showdown with fellow incumbent Republican Rep. Young Kim. Kim upped the stakes Wednesday by announcing that her campaign has already placed a $3.25 million ad buy in advance of the June primary election. 
On the Democratic side, Rep. Ami Bera announced he would challenge Kiley in the newly gerrymandered 3rd District, which encompasses Sacramento suburbs. That in turn prompted Dr. Richard Pan, a former state senator and a pediatrician who had already declared his candidacy, to relocate to the newly drawn 6th District to avoid a tough primary battle with a well-known incumbent. 
Legal challenges could change the maps again
California Republicans on Wednesday sued to block the Prop. 50 map, as they previously did twice, unsuccessfully, when the proposal was still on its way to the ballot. 
The suit, funded primarily by the National Republican Congressional Committee, claims the map causes “stigmatic and representational injury” by placing certain candidates, such as Republican Assemblymember David Tangipa of Fresno, who is Polynesian, into districts drawn with a specific racial or ethnic minority group in mind.
“The map is designed to favor one race of California voters over others,” said Mike Columbo, an attorney for the Dhillon Law Group, the firm founded by Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for civil rights in Trump’s Justice Department. 
Dhillon’s firm, along with the California Republican Party and Tangipa, is suing Newsom and Weber, asking a three-judge panel for a temporary restraining order before Dec. 19, the date when candidates can start collecting signatures to get their names on the 2026 primary ballot.
Legal scholars say the case faces long odds. The plaintiffs would have to prove that the primary intent of the map drawers – and California voters who approved Prop. 50 — was to racially gerrymander without proper evidence of racially polarized voting.
“It would be a very hard case to win,” said Emily Rong Zhang, an assistant professor of law at the University of California at Berkeley School of Law. “But if the Supreme Court changes the law, then the likelihood of success here might be higher.”
The justices are weighing Louisiana v. Callais, on whether to strike down the part of the Voting Rights Act that requires creating districts in which racial and ethnic minorities have a chance to elect their preferred candidate. That could render both the Prop. 50 maps and those drawn by the independent redistricting commission unconstitutional. 
Supporters of Prop. 50 have repeatedly said their maps will hold up to legal scrutiny. Paul Mitchell, the data consultant whose firm drew the lines, said the group in many cases hewed closely to configurations proposed by the citizens redistricting commission. An analysis by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute found the new maps largely kept communities together. 
Regardless of how SCOTUS rules, other states are still deciding whether to weigh in on the redistricting wars. Republicans in Kansas recently dropped an attempt to redraw their district lines, citing a lack of support. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, announced Wednesday that he was forming a committee to propose new congressional maps to eliminate the state’s one safe Republican seat, held by Rep. Andy Harris, who leads the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110425_Prop-50-Election-Fresno_LV_CM_33.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-05 18:57:02.833462

This story is based on stories by Violet Jira published on Nov. 5, 2025 by NOTUS, one before and one after the oral arguments. 
The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday related to the legality of President Donald Trump’s use of tariffs in a case that won’t just be deciding the fate of his trade policy, but also could redefine the limits of presidential economic power.
The hearing involved appeals in a pair of cases that challenge the Trump administration’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, including one with Vermont ties. Trump has used the law to bypass procedural norms and place extensive tariffs on enemies and trading partners alike without authorization from Congress.

One of the cases includes Terry Precision Cycling, or Terry Cycling, a women’s cycling apparel company, as one of five small business plaintiffs. The group sued Trump and his administration in the U.S. Court of International Trade in April. In May, a panel of three federal judges struck down most of the president’s tariffs. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit also largely backed the plaintiffs. The case was combined with another brought by private organizations impacted by the tariffs in Wednesday’s arguments in the Supreme Court. 
The court also heard from a representative of 12 attorneys general, including Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark, who sued on similar grounds.
During the arguments, Solicitor General D. John Sauer defended the Trump administration’s actions — sometimes by contradicting the president.
Sauer faced a slew of skeptical inquiries from the justices who seemed to take issue with many of the Trump administration’s arguments, including that the president has broad authority to respond to international emergencies, Congress delegated the presidency this power, and tariffs are not taxes.
Since the Constitution gives Congress the power to tax, the claim that tariffs are not a tax was central to Sauer’s argument, despite the fact that the president has framed them as revenue-raising.
“We don’t contend that what’s being exercised here is the power to tax,” Sauer said. “It’s the power to regulate foreign commerce. These are regulatory tariffs. They are not revenue raising tariffs.”
Trump regularly says tariffs are making the country richer. And earlier this year, the White House floated using tariffs as a revenue raiser to offset the cost of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who spoke recently at the University of Vermont, made clear that she didn’t buy Sauer’s argument on tariffs versus taxes.
“You say tariffs are not taxes, but that’s exactly what they are,” she said. “They’re generating money from American citizens, revenue.”

‘Simply implausible’
How the justices decide the case will have major implications not just for Trump’s agenda but for how much unilateral power presidents have to regulate commerce. 
During the arguments, Justice Neil Gorsuch leaned heavily into the question of congressional authority. He seemed to take issue with the fact that it would be difficult for Congress to reclaim that authority should the Supreme Court give the Trump administration what it was asking for.
“Congress, as a practical matter, can’t get this power back once it’s handed it over to the president. It’s a one way ratchet toward the gradual but continual accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the people’s elected representatives,” he argued.
Justice Amy Coney Barrett seemed skeptical of the scope of the reciprocal tariffs Trump has placed on dozens of countries, allies and trading partners alike.
“Is it your contention that every country needed to be tariffed because of threats to the defense and industrial base? I mean, Spain, France? I mean, I could see it with some countries, but explain to me why as many countries needed to be subject to the reciprocal tariff policy as are,” she asked.
The small businesses were represented by attorney Neal Katyal. He argued that tariffs are, in fact, a tax, and that the Trump administration was exceeding the authority Congress intended to give to the executive branch when it passed the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.
“It’s simply implausible that in enacting IEEPA, Congress handed the president the power to overhaul the entire tariff system and the American economy in the process, allowing him to set and reset tariffs on any and every product from any and every country at any and all times,” Katyal said.
“And as Justices Gorsuch and Barrett just said, this is a one-way ratchet,” he continued. “We will never get this power back if the government wins this case. What president wouldn’t veto legislation to rein this power in and pull out the tariff power?”
The Supreme Court has until the end of its term next summer to make a decision, but the case has so far been on an expedited track, leading some experienced court watchers to expect a decision before the end of the year.
Other routes for tariffs
The White House has projected confidence in its ability to win the case — press secretary Karoline Leavitt said officials believe the Supreme Court will rule in their favor. Still, contingency plans have long been in the works.
“The White House is always preparing for plan B,” she said at a briefing. “It would be imprudent of the president’s advisers not to prepare for such a situation. With that said, we are 100% confident in the president and his team’s legal argument and the merits of the law in this case, and we remain optimistic that the Supreme Court is going to do the right thing. The importance of this case cannot be overstated.”
Trump has used the threat of tariffs in matters far beyond trade. The administration used a tariff investigation to pressure Brazil over its decision to prosecute former President Jair Bolsonaro. Trump attempted to use trade negotiations to stop Canada from backing Palestinian statehood. The threat of steep tariffs has been an essential leverage point in his peace negotiations between countries like India and Pakistan, as well as Russia and Ukraine.
The Supreme Court’s decision could stymie all of this.
Administration officials have indicated that even if they lose the case, they would find another way to levy tariffs.
There are multiple legal avenues to enact tariffs. Top Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro has signaled the administration was considering use of Section 122 and then Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, if use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act is deemed unlawful.
Multiple trade experts NOTUS spoke to said this would be the most plausible course of action for Trump to keep his tariffs alive if the court rules against him.
Peter Harrell, who served as senior director for international economics and competitiveness in the Biden White House, said “the most obvious choice” for the White House to temporarily maintain tariffs would be to invoke Section 122. That would allow tariffs of up to 15% for as long as 150 days on countries whose trade with the U.S. is unjustifiably imbalanced.
“That, to me, looks like the sort of obvious, immediate stop gap they could pull to keep many of their tariffs in place for a couple of months while they figure out what the longer term plan is,” he said.
Section 301 of the trade act allows an administration to launch investigations into specific countries and implement tariffs based on the results of that investigation. There are already active Section 301 investigations into China, Brazil and Nicaragua; the latter two were started under the administration of President Joe Biden. The Trump administration could begin more of them, but the investigations take months and again open the administration up to the possibility of lawsuits.
Over the past few months, the Trump administration has expanded its use of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows him to put restrictions on the import of certain goods if they are found after an investigation to threaten national security.
But none of these powers is as expansive as the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, which the Trump administration has used to enact crushing tariffs with the stroke of a pen.
The International Economic Emergency Powers Act “only requires a finding of a national emergency, which is a more unilateral power within the president to make that determination,” said Everett Eissenstat, a partner at Squire Patton Boggs who represented the Trump administration on international trade matters as deputy director of the National Economic Council during Trump’s first term. “There’s no investigation, there’s no congressional consultation, it’s just a declaration of emergency, and that unleashes the power to regulate commerce, regulate importation.”
He added that there “were certainly more limitations” on Section 301 and Section 232.
If the Supreme Court were to rule in the Trump administration’s favor, it’s possible that the ruling wouldn’t just give the administration the legal go-ahead on current tariff policy, but open the door for the International Economic Emergency Powers Act to be used even more broadly than Trump is currently using it.
For the importers, business owners, consumers and taxpayers who are impacted by the president’s trade and tariff policy, a decision from the Supreme Court in either direction is unlikely to offer significant relief from the pressures of the Trump tariff economy.
“Unfortunately, if you’re a business, you can celebrate a Supreme Court win if that’s the way it goes, but you’re not going to be off the hook,” Riley said. “Trump will continue to impose tariffs, continue to impose costs on Americans, but he just won’t have the unlimited authority that he’ll have if the Supreme Court allows the IEEPA tariffs to remain in place.”

Meanwhile, the attorney for the defendant in Attorney General v. […]","Michigan Supreme Court / Hall of Justice | Photo by Jon KingAttorney General Dana Nessel’s ability to go after a major producer of insulin for price gouging was before the Michigan Supreme Court on Wednesday, with the state saying that it should be allowed to move forward in the matter despite previous court precedent noting otherwise.
Meanwhile, the attorney for the defendant in Attorney General v. Eli Lilly and Company said the attorney general’s office has failed to show an actual controversy exists and that this was an improper test case for the bounds of Michigan’s Consumer Protection Act.
The case centers around Nessel’s attempts to investigate the drug manufacturer to determine if its pricing practices for insulin violated the Michigan Consumer Protection Act. She asked the Ingham Circuit Court for subpoenas to gather information, and also filed a separate request for a judge to declare that her investigation wasn’t blocked by the act’s exemptions for activities already approved by government or regulatory agencies.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
That motion noted that Nessel’s interpretation of the act was out of step with the Michigan Supreme Court’s decisions in Smith v. Globe Life Insurance Company and Liss v. Lewiston-Richards Inc. Nessel has asserted that both of those cases were wrongly decided.
The appellate court affirmed the circuit court’s decision to dismiss the case in an unpublished opinion, which means the opinion was not binding on the lower courts or necessarily instructive to the Michigan Supreme Court.
In court on Wednesday, Assistant Attorney General Darrin Fowler reupped those arguments, and asked the justices of the high court to reconsider its previous findings in those cases, as well as for a determination if the case can be ferreted out in state court using the consumer protection act.
A key part of that is showing the court that there has been an adversarial relationship between the two parties and that it was a dispute for the court to take up.
“Here, the Attorney General was not required to bring an investigative petition to launch an insulin investigation into Eli Lilly,” Fowler said. “What the attorney general was required to do under the declaratory judgment rule was to give evidence of a sincere intention to invoke the consumer protection act against Lilly in a way that would be adversarial and would implicate the section for exemption”
Michigan AG argues for reversal of rulings that prevent insulin pricing investigation

Fowler added that the office has spent nearly four years arguing about the Smith and Liss issues from the circuit court up to the Court of Appeals, and now before the state’s high court. 
The bigger picture, Fowler said, was that the company is misconstruing the act and its requirement to show probable cause that a method or practice in pricing was unlawful.
Eli Lilly has said that the attorney general’s office engaged in a poor read of the act, an assertion that led the lower court to dismiss the case.
John O’Quinn, attorney for Eli Lilly, told the court that Smith and Liss were long-held precedent in consumer protection matters, and the Legislature has amended the act several times over. O’Quinn said that formed a “powerful chain” to show the high court, now, that the previous court’s decisions in those cases were correct.
“The Attorney General puts the cart before the horse in asking this court to decide the contours of an exemption, in the department’s words, an ‘affirmative defense’ as a threshold matter where the department has declined to show any legally viable violation has been alleged in the first place,” O’Quinn said.  .
Nessel files bypass application for Michigan Supreme Court to hear insulin case

The case being mired in procedural intricacies led the justices to ask mostly technical questions about other cases that could or should be overturned and different ways those decisions might have been attacked by the attorney general, instead of insisting it could move forward under the consumer protection act.
But Chief Justice Megan Cavanagh pointedly asked Fowler if the manufacturer could have appealed the lower court’s finding of probable cause, which led to the issue of subpoenas.
Fowler said that under the act, Eli Lilly had to start with a motion to quash, but the company opted not to do that. The company, instead, brought a motion to stay the case in the circuit court, which was a different argument than what was before the court on Wednesday.
Overall, Fowler said the state believed that the initial petition jump started the controversy, showing there was a tangible legal dispute for the court to parse.
Nessel, Singh react to court hearing
Following the hearing, Nessel, in a statement, doubled down on her office’s assertion that the decisions preclude state investigations into suspected illegal business practices when that business sells products or services authorized for sale under state or federal law. The attorney general’s office said that was irrespective of whether there was an allegation on how that business conducted its affairs.
“Eli Lilly has relied on these past Supreme Court decisions that twist a narrow exemption into something far too broad,” Nessel said. “The Michigan Consumer Protection Act is supposed to protect consumers, but instead it often shields many corporations from any real accountability, even when their business practices are clearly egregious. People in Michigan expect this law to have their back, and it is my hope that the Court sides with the consumers who have been hurt by deceptive practices.”
State Sen. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing), the Senate’s majority floor leader, said in a statement that Michigan has had “worst-in-the-nation consumer protection laws” for too long, which have “left residents across the state vulnerable to exploitation and fraudulent business practices – in this case, drug manufacturers profiting off of people’s pain.”
“While it’s my hope that the outcome of this case sets the dial in the right direction, we must also change the laws on our books to prioritize protections for consumers over corporations,” Singh said. “By restoring power to the Michigan Consumer Protection Act and giving more tools to the Attorney General’s office to hold bad actors accountable, my legislation would give Michiganders the peace of mind they deserve as they go about their day-to-day activities and purchases.”
Singh introduced Senate Bill 134 to help bolster Michigan’s consumer protection statute, which was passed by the Senate in June.
The bill now sits in the House Judiciary Committee and has not yet had a hearing.

Some are taking second jobs to make ends meet, leading to fatigue, Duffy said. Duffy said the restrictions would likely lead to more cancellations, which he said he was “concerned about,” but decided to prioritize safety.“We had a gut check of, what is our job?” he said. “Is it to make sure there's minimal delays or minimal cancellations, or is our job to make sure we make the hard decisions to continue to keep the airspace safe?

(File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A former South Carolina legislator was charged Wednesday with defrauding legal clients, according to a federal indictment.
Former Rep. Marvin Pendarvis, a Democrat, resigned the North Charleston seat he held for seven years last September after a legal client filed a malpractice lawsuit against him. The claims in the lawsuit prompted a State Law Enforcement Division investigation and caused the state Supreme Court to suspend Pendarvis’ law license.
Nineteen months after the investigation opened, Pendarvis faces charges of identity theft, money laundering and wire fraud, according to a U.S. District Court filing. He declined to comment on the charges when reached by the SC Daily Gazette.
Pendarvis is scheduled to appear in federal court in Charleston on Nov. 18.
The indictment claims he defrauded multiple clients.
It accuses him of running a scheme to get money and property from his legal clients between at least January 2022 and April 2024. Pendarvis took on injury cases and other legal matters involving a loss so he could then negotiate settlements. He either didn’t tell clients he settled their cases or told them they received less than the amount he negotiated, according to the case presented to a federal grand jury.
State Rep. Marvin Pendarvis resigns amid accusations from a former client

Through this scheme, Pendarvis received at least $532,000, which he deposited in his law firm’s bank account and did not use to pay clients, according to the indictment.
Among those are four instances between June 8, 2023, and March 13, 2024, when the court filing claims Pendarvis cashed checks between $10,000 and $100,000 into his own bank account. Pendarvis’ four charges of wire fraud stemmed from those incidents, according to the filing.
On at least three occasions, Pendarvis also signed his clients’ names on settlement releases with insurance companies and filed court documents on the settlements without informing his clients, leading to his charges of identity theft, the indictment alleged.
Because Pendarvis got the money in his legal account unlawfully, two transfers of a combined $75,000 from that account to a savings account, owned by an unnamed person, constituted money laundering, according to the legal filing. Pendarvis transferred another $60,000 to a separate bank account operated by the same unnamed person, the filing claimed.
If convicted, Pendarvis would have to repay any of the money a judge or jury determined he received as part of the scheme, according to the filing.
The claims are similar to those in a lawsuit from former client Adrian Lewis.
Lewis claimed Pendarvis settled a lawsuit without his permission after largely ignoring Lewis throughout the case. Although Pendarvis sent Lewis two checks for a total of $6,667, Lewis didn’t realize the case was settled until he reached out to the sheriff’s office, he claimed in his April 2024 lawsuit. The settlement document included Lewis’ signature, which he claimed was a forgery.
Pendarvis tried to bribe Lewis with offers of cash and to pay off his mortgage after Lewis realized the case was settled, he claimed in the lawsuit, which seeks an unspecified amount of money.

(Getty photos)An immigrant advocacy organization and the ACLU of Wisconsin are criticizing the Marathon County Sheriff’s decision to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in an agreement that gives county jail staff some immigration enforcement authority. 
ICE records show the county signed an agreement on Tuesday to participate in the ICE 287(g) jail enforcement program. Under the jail enforcement model, county jail staff can question people in the jail about their immigration status and the county can hold non-citizens in jail for up to 48 hours to be picked up by federal agents. 
Since President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January, ICE has been working to significantly expand the program across the country. Marathon is the fifth sheriff’s department in Wisconsin to sign an agreement with ICE this year, increasing the total from nine to 14. The Palmyra police department has also signed an agreement with the agency. 
“By applying to participate in the 287(g) program, the Marathon County Sheriff is offering to have his department be turned into an arm of ICE’s deportation machine,” the ACLU of Wisconsin said in a statement. “The 287(g) program is notorious for leading to racial profiling, unconstitutional policing, and wrongful detention of US citizens — and it makes communities less safe. People are less likely to seek help and report crime when their local law enforcement is seen as a partner with ICE, and going to the authorities could mean that they, a family member or a friend could be deported.”
Aside from 287(g), the Dodge County sheriff’s office has a contract with the federal government to hold federal detainees at the county jail. That agreement includes holding migrants on behalf of ICE and sometimes transporting them to and from out-of-state facilities such as the controversial ICE processing center in Broadview, Ill. 
Voces de la Frontera, an immigrant advocacy group, said the sheriff, Chad Billeb, should have engaged with the community before deciding to sign the agreement. 
“Sheriff Chad Billeb, as an elected official, should not have signed this agreement without engaging the community and local leaders in a transparent, democratic process that ensures accountability and information sharing. There is still time to do so and reverse course,” said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, the organization’s executive director.

House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican and candidate for state insurance commissioner, announced Tuesday night that he failed to gather enough signatures in his chamber to jumpstart a special session planned for Friday.
For Masterson, an Andover Republican and gubernatorial candidate, it wasn’t a surprise.
“All it does is change the timing,” he said following an unrelated Wednesday meeting at the Statehouse in Topeka.
“It is what it is,” he said.
Both he and Hawkins have acknowledged how difficult it is to call the Kansas Legislature into a special session. After allocating $460,000 to fund a four-day session, a visit to the White House and obtaining at least half of the signatures needed to call legislators to the capital, the focus has shifted to Jan. 12, the start of the 2026 session.
A special session requires two-thirds of both the state Senate and House members to sign a petition. Republicans planned to gerrymander U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids’ district in the Johnson County area to turn it red. Masterson announced on Oct. 27 that he obtained the necessary two-thirds of member signatures.
Masterson said Wednesday he has a high level of confidence in achieving a Republican agenda to legislate public assistance programs and gender identity issues. When it comes to property taxes and redistricting, however, details are fuzzy.
Property tax relief legislation could evolve as the session progresses, and no concrete proposals have been made.
A redrawn congressional map could also prove challenging. No one has seen what a Kansas map could look like, Masterson said.
“There’s been a ton of maps floated around, but they’re all from third-party people,” he said.
When asked if he’d support a Kansas-driven map rather than one drawn by a national group or other third-party, he paused.
“I think there’s a little nuance there,” he said.
Whether a map is drawn in-state or “whether it’s drawn by a group that does it effectively for states all over the country for us,” Masterson said, is unclear.
Regardless, he said, “It’ll be Kansas-driven.”
Mid-decade redistricting efforts cropped up across the country, beginning first in Texas and spreading to North Carolina, Missouri and Ohio. Democrats added seats in California and Utah. Discussions are underway to add Republican seats in Kansas, Nebraska, Florida and Indiana, and discussions adding Democratic seats have arisen in Illinois, Maryland and Virginia.
House Democratic Leader Brandon Woodard, of Lenexa, said the end of the Republican rush to build support for a special session “makes Kansas the first state to reject President Trump’s proposed redistricting initiative aimed at influencing the 2026 midterm elections.”
Senate Democratic Leader Dinah Sykes said in an interview after the Wednesday meeting that avoiding a special session was a win, but the battle isn’t over.
“On the fact that we are saving Kansas taxpayers $400,000, that is a win,” said Sykes, of Lenexa.
She said Kansas Democrats’ strategy in the wake of redistricting efforts involves engaging constituents to ensure they know “Republicans are trying to lessen their voice” and to make maps are publicly available.
Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, said in a statement that Republican leadership will “continue their attempt at a partisan power grab in January,” despite a lack of support from their caucuses.
“It doesn’t matter whether it’s during special or regular session,” Kelly said. “Kansans will continue to speak out against gerrymandered maps drawn by dark money groups and funded by out-of-state special interests.”
Laurel Burchfield, spokesperson for the Kansas Fair Maps Coalition, acknowledged in a Wednesday statement that the redistricting attempt isn’t over.
“Changing the maps mid-decade to rig the system in either political party’s favor is wrong,” Burchfield said. “We urge legislators to focus on what Kansans need the most this upcoming session: lowering costs, making healthcare affordable, and improving our economy.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/251104_spsesh-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-05 18:17:37.095502
,DC,2025-11-05 22:59:26+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Energized Dems trumpet wins in state elections, buckle up for midterms","Jacob Fischler, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/energized-dems-trumpet-wins-state-elections-buckle-midterms,,"WASHINGTON — Democrats’ sweep of the biggest races in Tuesday’s off-year elections, including a California ballot measure to redraw that state’s congressional lines to give the party up to five more seats in the U.S. House, gave the party new confidence heading into the midterm elections next year.Democrats proclaimed the performances of Govs.-elect Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani showed voters’ rejection of President Donald Trump. “The election results were not vague,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters Wednesday. “They were not unclear. They were a lightning bolt: Trump, America doesn't like what you're doing. Change course.”Republicans won control of the White House and both chambers of Congress one year ago, leaving Democrats without a clear leader or agenda at the national level. Tuesday’s results helped clarify for the party that a focus on economic issues was a winning message that Democrats could carry into the midterms.Those messengers included Sherrill and Spanberger on the one end of the party’s ideological spectrum, and the Democratic Socialist Mamdani on the other. All three shared a campaign message centered on addressing the cost of living.More remaps Effective campaigning may not be the only path Democrats are expected to take as they seek to regain power at the federal level. A wing of the party led by California Gov. Gavin Newsom is pushing other Democratic governors to redraw congressional lines to be more favorable to them.The new California map is likely to be tied up in courts, at least in the short term. California Republicans sued in federal court Wednesday morning to block it. Republicans, meanwhile, sought to downplay the importance of elections in largely Democratic areas while attempting to make Mamdani the new face of Democrats nationally.U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday there were “no surprises” in the previous day’s elections.

“What happened last night was blue states and blue cities voted blue,” the Louisiana Republican said. “We all saw that coming, and no one should read too much into last night's election results — off-year elections are not indicative of what's to come.” The wins in Tuesday’s elections galvanized congressional Democrats to restart negotiations to end the government shutdown on their terms, with Democratic leaders of the House and Senate sending Trump a three-sentence letter “to demand” a meeting to negotiate an end to the longest government shutdown in history.Control of CongressDemocrats said Wednesday the results showed they were within striking distance of regaining majorities in both chambers of Congress.Democrats would have to net four seats in the House and the Senate to win control of a respective chamber.Schumer said Tuesday’s results showed that was possible in the Senate.“The election showed that Democrats’ control of the Senate is much closer than the people and the prognosticators realize,” Schumer said. “The more Republicans double down on raising costs and bowing down to Trump, the more their Senate majority is at risk.”Vice President JD Vance was dismissive of Democratic gains Wednesday, saying on social media it was “idiotic to overreact to a couple elections in blue states” and praising Republican organizing efforts.But Democratic campaign officials said Wednesday that analysis belied wins lower on the ballot, including flipping 13 Virginia House of Delegates seats, half of which Republicans held for decades, and statewide wins for low-profile offices in the key swing states of Georgia and Pennsylvania.Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin responded to Vance’s claim during a press call.“That's bullsh---,” he said. “We won all over the country in red counties and purple counties and in blue counties. The reality is, is this was a huge rejection of the Trump extremism and an embrace of the hopeful, positive message that Democrats are offering up.”Martin and other Democrats praised Tuesday’s winners for relentlessly focusing on economic issues, and said Democratic candidates in 2026 would keep that focus.Redistricting arms raceNewsom, the chief backer of the referendum to temporarily revoke power from the state’s nonpartisan redistricting commission, told other Democratic governors to take similar measures to enhance the party’s chances of winning a U.S. House majority.“We need Virginia ... we need Maryland ... we need our friends in New York and Illinois and Colorado — we need to see other states meet this moment head-on as well,” Newsom said in a fundraising email Wednesday.Martin characterized the passage of the California referendum, known as Proposition 50, as a reaction to Republican states’ moves to redraw their lines. “What happened in Prop 50 was the counterpunch to level the playing field,” Martin said. He indicated Democratic states would be happy to leave congressional districts as they are, but said the party would not hesitate to respond to GOP gerrymanders.“Now, they want to keep doing it? Guess what: This is not your grandfather's Democratic Party,” Martin said. “We will meet you in every single state that you decide to try to steal more seats. We're going to meet you in other states. We are not going to play with one hand behind our back. We're not going to roll over. We are going to meet you, fire with fire.” Rep. Richard Hudson, a North Carolina Republican who chairs the U.S. House Republican campaign organization, predicted in a statement that efforts to redraw congressional districts would not allow Democrats to win a majority in that chamber. “No matter how Democrats redraw the lines to satisfy Gavin Newsom’s power grab, they can’t redraw their record of failure, and that’s why they will fail to take the House majority,” Hudson said. “Even under this new map, Republicans have clear opportunities to flip seats because Californians are fed up with Democrat chaos. We will continue to compete and win because our candidates are stronger, our message is resonating, and Californians are tired of being ignored.”Trump zeroes in on filibuster At a Wednesday breakfast with GOP senators, Trump had another idea for solidifying GOP power, saying the Senate needs to abolish the filibuster in order to end the shutdown and enact GOP policy while the party is still in the majority. Senate rules require at least 60 senators to advance a bill past the filibuster. Republicans’ narrow 53-seat majority has created obstacles in moving forward their agenda — including the House-passed stopgap spending bill to keep the government open that’s now failed more than a dozen times. ""It’s time for Republicans to do what they have to do and that’s terminate the filibuster,” Trump said at the breakfast. ""It’s the only way you can do it, and if you don’t terminate the filibuster, you’ll be in bad shape — we won’t pass any legislation.” He added: “We will pass legislation at levels you’ve never seen before, and it’ll be impossible to beat us.” In a social media post Tuesday night, Trump said pollsters attributed Republicans’ election losses to his name not being on the ballot along with the ongoing shutdown.Trump wrote in a separate post earlier Tuesday that “the Democrats are far more likely to win the Midterms, and the next Presidential Election, if we don’t do the Termination of the Filibuster (The Nuclear Option!).” GOP senators tepidHowever, Trump’s push to do away with the filibuster has garnered little enthusiasm from GOP senators, including Majority Leader John Thune. The South Dakota Republican reiterated on Wednesday that “there are not the votes there,” telling reporters that “the main thing we need to be focused on right now, in my view, is get the government opened up again.” But some GOP senators appear to be on board with the idea, including Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who said he expressed his support for eliminating the filibuster during the breakfast.“President Trump made a very convincing case,” Johnson told reporters. “We know the minute Democrats get (a) majority in the Senate, they’re going to get rid of the filibuster.” “We better beat them to the punch and act while we can pass legislation for the benefit of the American public,” he added.  Sen. Jim Justice said that though he’s not in favor of getting rid of the filibuster, he wants to support Trump and would like the shutdown to end. “I mean, because you got a lot of people that are really hurting, that's all there is to it, and if it's the only option to stop this nonsense, then I would support,” the West Virginia Republican said. Sen. John Kennedy remained firm in his position, telling reporters that “the role of the senator is not just to advance good ideas, the role of the senator is to kill bad ideas, and when you’re in the minority — we’re not now, but we could be someday — it’s important to have a filibuster.” The Louisiana Republican noted that “we killed a lot of (former) President Biden's goofy ideas through a filibuster, and someday the shoe will be on the other foot, and that's why I've always supported the filibuster.” Republicans lash Democrats to MamdaniSpeaker Johnson and fellow House Republican leaders also sought to tie Mamdani to the Democratic Party. Johnson said Mamdani “is truly a committed Marxist, and the results of that race tell you everything you need to know about where the Democrats in their party are headed,” adding that “from the backbench to their leadership, Democrats have fallen in line behind the socialist candidates.” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana echoed that “when the city of New York elected Zohran Mamdani, he became the new leader of the Democrat(ic) Party.” Scalise said that while the Democratic Party “had no problem making the shift to socialism — which they embraced wholeheartedly, led by Hakeem Jeffries and others here — America, mainstream Americans, Blue Dog Democrats across America, have not embraced socialism.” House Republican Conference Chair Lisa McClain of Michigan said “over the past year, Democrats have wandered around with no plan, no vision and no leader, but today, they finally found their leader — the radical communist mayor(-elect) of New York City, a self-proclaimed communist who wants Americans to pay for global health care.” She added: “Well, you wanted it. You got it: A communist who wants the government to own grocery stores and a communist who wants the government to tell you what to do with your hard-earned money.” Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-11-05 18:17:37.095502

Humphreys County Sheriff Bruce Williams pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit drug distribution, drug distribution and firearms conspiracy. After a years-long investigation, Williams was arrested last Thursday by FBI agents, who fanned across the Mississippi Delta in armored cars and conducted a series of predawn arrests. 
By sunrise, 20 people, including 14 law enforcement officers, across the Delta and Tennessee had been arrested.
Williams allegedly received multiple bribes from undercover FBI agents posing as Mexican cartel members “for his blessing for the cartel to operate in his county” and for the cartel to use his deputies for protection. Multiple bribes totaling $18,000 were paid to the sheriff during the conspiracy, the indictment said. 
In a statement to Mississippi Today on Wednesday, Mike Carr, Williams’s attorney, said the sheriff had pleaded not guilty to all counts in the indictment in which he is named. 
“We look forward to receiving and reviewing the Government’s alleged evidence in this case,” Carr said. “We anticipate a full and complete defense to all of the allegations — every accused person in this country stands not guilty until proven beyond a reasonable doubt otherwise. We are looking forward to our day in court.”
The investigation and alleged law enforcement corruption spanned counties across the Delta and stretched into Memphis, where some of the officers are alleged to have accepted bribes in exchange for providing protection to undercover FBI agents posing as members of a Mexican drug cartel.
The federal probe began years ago when the FBI Jackson field office connected with a known local drug dealer who investigators code-named “Green.” The drug dealer became a confidential informant for the FBI. Between 2023 and 2024, the officers escorted the undercover agents transporting cocaine through the rural Delta along U.S. Highway 61 and into Memphis, court records allege.
Of the 20 individuals charged, 19 are accused of illegally carrying a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime. The charges, which are outlined across multiple indictments, portray an operation that extended from rank-and-file patrol officers up through police chiefs and sheriffs.
In Humphreys County, Williams ran unopposed for sheriff in 2023 and had been serving a four-year term set to expire in 2027. 
Williams took a leave of absence following his arrest, and the Humphreys County Board of Supervisors appointed former Belzoni police Chief Mickey Foxworth as interim sheriff. That is because federal authorities offered him a bond agreement that prohibits him from staying employed as a law enforcement officer. The agreement demands that he seek another form of employment, the bond agreement shows. 
The other elected sheriff arrested in the federal takedown, Washington County Sheriff Milton Gaston, is also accused of attempting to disguise bribes in the form of “campaign contributions.” Court records did not show an attorney listed for Gatson, and it was not clear on Wednesday if he had entered a plea yet. 
The arrests stunned residents of the Delta, one of the poorest regions of the country. Residents were still reeling from a mass shooting earlier this month that killed nine people and wounded a dozen more during or after high school and college homecoming celebrations.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/31084950/AP25303613030034.jpg,,,2025-11-05 17:56:54.636805
,Mississippi Today,2025-11-05 22:53:52+00:00,Mississippi Today,Leaders in the town that helped elect House Speaker Jason White just voted ‘no’ to school choice,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/05/kosciusko-school-choice/,"House Speaker Jason White continues to champion school choice at the state Capitol, but some of his constituents aren’t so sure about the policies.","House Speaker Jason White continues to champion school choice at the state Capitol, but some of his constituents aren’t so sure about the policies.
The Kosciusko Board of Aldermen adopted an anti-school choice resolution on Tuesday night, breaking from their representative and the set of proposals that White, a Republican, is aggressively pushing at the Capitol. Kosciusko, located 70 miles north of Jackson, is the largest city in White’s district, which encompasses parts of Attala, Carroll, Holmes and Leake counties, and it’s where his law office is located. 
Kosciusko joins a handful of cities that have publicly denounced school choice policies, which fund educational opportunities outside of traditional public schools, often with state money. The boards’ actions could signal a lack of support among everyday Mississippians, while powerful state lawmakers like White continue their years-long, full-court press for school choice, backed by billionaire-funded national conservative organizations and the Trump administration. Proponents of school choice say there is also a grassroots movement driven by parents that have buoyed their cause.
Taylor Spillman, a spokesperson for White, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the resolution. 
The resolution calls the local public school system — graded an ‘A’ for three years straight by the Mississippi Department of Education — the “lifeblood” of the community and urges the Kosciusko legislative delegation to oppose school choice policies. The statement defines education savings accounts, vouchers and tax-credit programs — which all direct taxpayer money to private or homeschool education — as school choice policies. 
When reached by Mississippi Today, Kosciusko Mayor Tim Kyle noted that open enrollment policies that loosen regulations around public school transfers would also divert funds from the local school district. 
Henry Daniel, a Democrat who represents Ward 2 on the Kosciusko board, said he voted for the local resolution because he doesn’t think private schools should receive taxpayer funds if they don’t adhere to the same admission and testing standards as public schools, which have to admit and serve all students regardless of background or ability. 
Last month, Barrett Donahoe, executive director of the Mid-South Association of Independent Schools, told lawmakers that private schools his organization represents were not willing to support school choice unless the dollars came with no strings attached. 
“We’ve got a good school system here,” Daniel said. “Even though Jason is our representative … you have to put that to the side and see what’s best for the kids and the community.”
Dr. Tim Alford co-authored the resolution, which he modeled after one passed by the Clinton Board of Aldermen, and brought it before the Kosciusko board on Tuesday. All three of his children were educated in the public school district. The experience taught them how to get along with people of all backgrounds, Alford said.
“My thought is that a lot of these folks, they feel like some of the public school communities are beyond saving, and the alternative is just to retreat into the private world, which is in large part segregated,” he said. “The public school world … has some good things going on. To me, that’s where we ought to be concentrating our efforts and energies.”
When white Mississippians left the Delta amid school desegregation, Alford witnessed the devastation that flight wrought on his hometown of Greenwood. He said he’s afraid school choice policies will spur similar results in Kosciusko — and he said he’s already seeing seeds of that outcome. 
“To be honest, I think the white flight tendency is happening in Kosciusko now,” he said. “There are private school options that are available immediately in the community and some several miles down the road that parents are choosing. We don’t have the balance of race that we used to have. I’m afraid to say that I think that is part of what is driving this.”
White, who lives in West, sent his children to a Jackson-area private school. His public school district, Holmes County Consolidated School District, has historically struggled academically and is currently under state control.
Alford acknowledged that White has been “very helpful” to Kosciusko and said they both want to improve educational opportunities for all Mississippians.
“I hate to run up against Rep. White because I think he has the best intentions,” Alford said. “But he and I disagree on how to get there.”
Kyle, the mayor, said while he understands and supports parents’ desires to have more choices regarding their child’s education, he doesn’t think that should come at the expense of the public school district. He believes the board’s vote represents the majority of Kosciuskians.
Kyle said Kosciuskians’ opposition is at least partially driven by a fear of the unknown — legislators are drafting an omnibus education bill that would expand school choice in Mississippi, though it’s unclear what specific policies will make it into the legislation.
Some House Republicans support sending money to private schools through vouchers, while others want to keep school choice reforms limited to making it easier for students to transfer between public schools.
School choice policies in other states have resulted in higher private school tuition, skyrocketing education costs and worse academic outcomes. 
“As your schools go, so does your community,” Kyle said. “We don’t want that to happen. That’s the message our community wanted to send.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/06081844/AP23272750753821-scaled.jpg,,,2025-11-05 17:56:54.636805

Students are also performing better, according to a presentation to the State Board of Education. About 72% of AP exams earned a score of 3 or higher, the threshold for college credit, according to state data. State officials said the number of qualifying scores has nearly doubled since 2021, as more students take more exams and succeed at higher rates.
“North Carolina public school students are making history,” said Superintendent of Public Instruction Maurice “Mo” Green during a press conference Wednesday.
“This is what it means to achieve educational excellence for all students,” Green said. “Being able to increase scores while increasing access – two metrics that sometimes do not rise together – is huge.”
School officials said that all student groups and regions saw gains both in participation and performance on AP exams. Sneha Shah-Coltrane, the state Department of Public Instruction’s senior director of advanced learning and gifted education, said the growth reflects a broader shift in mindset across schools, including the view that advanced coursework should be available to every student, not just those in well-resourced communities.

“As you can see from all of these incredible districts from across North Carolina, we want to ensure that each and every child has access and success for advanced coursework,” said Shah-Coltrane. “It doesn’t matter where you live, we are working hard to ensure we are providing access and opportunities to each and every one of our students across North Carolina.”
The Southeast region saw the largest increase in participation, with 10.8% more students taking AP exams than last year. The West recorded the biggest rise in total exams administered at 17.5%, while the Northeast posted a 28% increase in qualifying scores, the fastest year-over-year score growth in the state.
State leaders also credited a decades-long effort to expand AP access, including a 2015 law that created the NC AP Partnership. The program, which pairs DPI with the College Board, provides professional development and targeted district support.
Districts leaders shared examples of changes they said helped expand access to advanced coursework and improve student success.
In the Alamance-Burlington School System, where the number of qualifying scores more than doubled, Superintendent Aaron Fleming said the district stopped offering an honors version of some classes and instead enrolled students directly into AP courses.
“We’ve made a deliberate move to offer pre-calculus only as an AP course, eliminating the honors option,” Fleming said. “This has successfully given students who hadn’t previously taken an AP course a chance to experience and succeed in a rigorous academic environment.”
The district also introduced courses such as AP Seminar and AP African American Studies, encouraging more students to attempt college-level work.
North Carolina’s growth continues to outpace the nation, with the state’s qualifying AP exam scores rising from 65.4% in 2024 to 72.1% in 2025, compared with a national increase from 65% to 70.1% over the same period.
Green said the state’s progress supports its broader goal of making North Carolina’s public schools the best in the nation by 2030.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AdobeStock-Testing-Large.jpg,,,2025-11-05 17:56:54.636805

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Brian Kruse announced his resignation Wednesday as Douglas County election commissioner after 10 years in the role.
Kruse will remain in the post through the end of 2025. His last day is Jan. 9, according to a press release.
“I appreciate the trust that Governors Ricketts and Pillen have placed in me leading the Douglas County Election Commission,” Kruse said in the press release. “It has been an honor and privilege for the last decade to serve the voters of Douglas County in administering fair, accurate, secure and impartial elections.”
Election commissioners are tasked with maintaining voter registration records for their respective counties, and oversee the primary, general and special elections in their area.
Kruse plans to return to the funeral industry, where he worked prior to his appointment as election commissioner. He will join Forest Lawn Cemetery & Funeral Home as its general manager.

Kruse said he made the decision to step down on his own, after he was approached with the opportunity to work for Forest Lawn Cemetery & Funeral Home. While he wasn’t looking to leave his current post, he said he determined that after 10 years, it was the right time to “slow down.”
Kruse said his time as election commissioner has been amazing, offering him a “front-row seat” to watch democracy in action in one of the most competitive congressional districts in the nation. Kruse has overseen the last three presidential elections in Douglas County.
“It’s been a great ride,” Kruse told the Examiner.
Gov. Jim Pillen will be tasked with appointing Kruse’s replacement. Per Nebraska law, counties with a population greater than 100,000 people — currently Douglas, Lancaster and Sarpy counties — must have an election commissioner appointed by the governor.
In a separate press release, Pillen said he has opened applications for the position, which can be accessed on the governor’s website. The deadline to apply is 5 p.m. Nov. 26.
“Brian has always maintained high standards for his office and ensuring the integrity of local, general and special elections,” Pillen said in the press release. “I appreciate his years of public service and the level of excellence that he brought to such a critical role.”

President Donald Trump has nominated Steve Pearce, a Republican former member of Congress from New Mexico, to lead the federal Bureau of Land Management, the White House announced Wednesday.
Pearce would be in charge of an agency that oversees 245 million acres of public lands, including for recreation, cattle grazing and extraction of oil and natural gas. 
His nomination drew swift criticism from environmental groups in New Mexico and across the country. They urged Congress to reject Trump’s nomination. 
“Pearce’s entire political career has been dedicated to blocking Americans’ access to public lands while giving the oil and gas industry free rein to drill and frack anywhere they wanted,” said Jennifer Rokala, executive director of the Center for Western Priorities, in a statement Wednesday afternoon. 
Pearce, who founded an oilfield services company before getting into politics, represented New Mexico’s Second Congressional District in the southern part of the state between 2003 and 2009, then again from 2011 to 2019. He was most recently chair of the state Republican Party until late last year. 
Trump’s Wednesday nomination to  the United States Senate neither explained why Pearce would be fit to lead the agency nor provided details about when the Senate could meet to confirm him. The nomination occurs amid an ongoing federal government shutdown, when neither chamber of Congress is meeting.

According to the Center for Western Priorities, Pearce amassed a “lengthy anti-public lands record” while in Congress, including co-sponsoring bills undermining the Antiquities Act and opening national forests to industry. 
If the Senate confirms him, Pearce would take over at an agency that is seeking to boost domestic oil and gas production and roll back the “Public Land Rule,” which sought to ensure conservation of public lands received due consideration along with mining, timber, grazing, recreation or other uses.
The BLM controls about 13.5 million acres of federal land in New Mexico. 
“It’s appalling that Trump would nominate a political has-been who so despises the natural world to oversee millions of acres of our public lands and waters,” said Brian Nowicki, Southwest deputy director of the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement.
While environmental groups were unified in condemning Pearce’s nomination, the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association Executive Director Kaitlynn Glover said in a statement that Pearce’s “experience makes him thoroughly qualified to lead the BLM and tackle the issues federal lands ranchers are facing.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Steve_pearce.jpg,,,2025-11-05 17:56:54.636805

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)At the heart of the longest-ever federal shutdown — now in its sixth week — is whether or not to extend enhanced tax credits for millions of Americans purchasing their plans on Affordable Care Act marketplaces. 
Pennie’s open enrollment period for almost 500,000 Pennsylvanians began on Nov. 1, with premiums expected to nearly double or even triple in some cases if those tax credits expire. 
Credits are calculated on a sliding scale depending on one’s income and location. They’re designed to make insurance coverage affordable, but come at an annual cost of roughly $1 trillion for the federal government. 
 
Pennsylvanians looking for marketplace coverage should visit www.Pennie.com or call 1–844-884-8040


“Folks are really panicked,” said Antoinette Kraus, the executive director of Pennsylvania Health Access Network. “They’re trying to figure out ,‘Can I find something that fits within my budget? Do I have to go uninsured?’”
“People are really trying to take a step back and figure out what their options are,” Kraus continued.
Her organization advocates for consumer-based health policy and provides insurance navigation assistance. She said calls have ticked up in recent days. In order to have coverage by Jan. 1, people should enroll by Dec. 15, according to Pennie. 
That means potential Pennie enrollees don’t need to sign up today, Kraus emphasized. 
“I think our advice to folks is it’s important to come and shop. There’s a bunch of plans available at different levels, so let’s shop around and see if there are options that meet your budget,” Kraus said. 
A Pennie release about open enrollment noted several federal changes to the process, including increased penalties for outdated information. For people  making roughly $62,600 (or couples making $84,600), there are no longer tax credits available, but  those making less may still qualify for smaller benefits. 
In October, the Pennsylvania Insurance Department approved rate increases across insurance plans — both those available through Pennie and outside of it. Separately, Pennie estimated that premiums for Pennsylvanians would increase by 102% — which is below the average 114% national increase calculated by KFF.

But some counties will fare better than others. Counties in the northeastern corner, like Sullivan and Wayne, would see monthly increases as low as 29%. Rural central Pennsylvania counties like Fulton and Juniata will have some of the highest monthly increases at 411% and 485%, respectively.
Pennie enrollees are made up of part-time employees, gig workers, farmers, small business owners and others without affordable insurance options. Most use tax credits to lower their monthly premium costs.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that nearly 4 million more people will eventually be uninsured if the subsidies expire and that extending the enhanced credits would cost an additional $35 billion annually. 
 Ripple effects

The enhanced premium tax credits are designed so that no enrollee spends more than 8.5% of their income on a health insurance premium. The Philadelphia Inquirer earlier this year calculated that as many as 250,000 Pennsylvanians — half of all Pennie enrollees — could lose their insurance coverage if enhanced tax credits aren’t extended.
Such actions could have a detrimental effect on the state’s health care landscape. If younger, healthier enrollees pull out of the system, for example, premiums will increase for the remaining members who are disproportionately older and sicker than the general population. 
“Our biggest concern is people are just going to go without coverage, which pushes up the uninsured rate, which impacts us all — whether we’re on Pennie or not,” Kraus said. “People who don’t get care for small things, it turns into larger things and they end up in the emergency room. So your wait time could be longer because there could be more folks in the emergency room.”

Uncompensated care costs, or health care services devoted to those without payment, could also increase, eating into the bottom line of thinly stretched rural hospitals and providers. 
Additionally, some scammers have websites designed to look like legitimate online insurance marketplaces in an attempt to collect personal information and payments. Some call or email for special rates and time sensitive pitches. 
Even if they offer plans, they might not meet federal minimums or provide “adequate coverage,” warns state Attorney General Dave Sunday. 
”Scammers today try to attach their scams to trending events and happenings, making them more believable and increasing their chances of success,” Sunday said in a release. “If you are using the marketplace to shop for a new health insurance plan this year, be sure you are practicing due diligence. Do not let scammers prevent you from accessing necessary medical care.”
Pennie is the state’s only marketplace and has resources for those seeking localized or in-person guidance. 
 Pa’s congressional delegation

The commonwealth’s 17 members of the U.S. House split on partisan lines when it came to voting on a continuing resolution to fund the federal government, with all seven Democrats against and Republicans supporting the measure. 
Tax credits aren’t due to expire until the end of the year and the continuing resolution currently under consideration would only fund services through Nov. 21 without explicitly impacting those benefits. But Democrats want an extension before signing onto any spending agreement.
Several Democrats pinned projected increases on Republicans and vowed to withhold their support unless tax credits were extended. 
“Today, millions of Americans are being forced to make impossible choices because of the Republican health care crisis,” wrote Rep. Brendan Boyle, (D-2nd District), on Nov. 1. “Families across the country will pay double or triple what they did before — or lose their coverage altogether.”
Pennsylvania U.S. Sen. John Fetterman, also a Democrat, broke with his party to vote in favor of a funding deal that didn’t include an extension.

“I’m the guy that’s going to consistently vote for country over party,” he said in a one-minute video statement earlier this month, citing priorities like military pay and food benefits. “… and I’m also going to fight for the same 420,000 Pennsylvanians that depend on those tax credits to make health insurance more affordable.
“Two things are true and we can fight for all of them as long as our government is open,” he added.  
Some House Republicans have taken a similar stance, including three Pennsylvania representatives who signed onto a letter urging U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson to revisit the subsidies once a funding agreement is reached. 
Three of Pennsylvania’s 10 House Republicans signed the letter, including Rep. Rob Bresnahan, Jr. (8th District). Bresnahan told the Capital-Star he supported an extension, and emphasized the need to reopen the government before negotiations could begin.

“I am proud to be an original cosponsor of legislation to extend the ACA tax credits. I remain committed to working across the aisle to find a solution, but I refuse to hold our troops and federal workers and their pay hostage to do so. As my colleagues and I said in our letter, ‘using the shutdown as leverage to force debate only prolongs the harm and distracts from the immediate task of reopening the government.’ I look forward to working on a solution to these tax credits with Speaker Johnson as soon as the government reopens,” he said. 
Other Republicans have pushed for a one-year or two-year extension of the tax credits. As of Wednesday, negotiations still appeared to be at an impasse.
However, Pennie Executive Director Devon Trolley told WESA last week that any congressional action in November wouldn’t be immediate, urging patience for those navigating the system. He said it may take a week or two before Pennie can incorporate any changes. 
Kraus advised participants to monitor their mail, email and trusted sources in the coming weeks for more news.

Brandon Cox, R-Goose Creek, speaks to the Juvenile Crime Assessment and Strategic Reform Ad Hoc Committee during a meeting in Columbia, S.C., on Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2025. (Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream)COLUMBIA — After a recent spate of shootings involving teenagers, a panel of South Carolina legislators is looking at ways to reduce the amount of gun violence involving children and teens.
Violence among children and problems in the system meant to help them is not a new issue. For years, the Department of Juvenile Justice has grappled with overcrowding, understaffing and the resulting violence among children at the state’s detention centers.
The first meeting of the newly formed six-member House committee examining juvenile justice issues came days after a shooting in Blythewood at a Halloween night bonfire injured three teenagers. It was the latest in a string of teenage gatherings that ended in gunfire over the past several years.
“They were simply being teenagers, and gunshots erupted,” said Rep. Kambrell Garvin, a Columbia Democrat whose district includes the area of the weekend shooting.
Rep. Brandon Cox, R-Goose Creek, began looking at juvenile crime issues in August at House Speaker Murrell Smith’s request, he said. No specific incident served as the starting point, but a high rate of crime involving teenagers created cause for concern, Cox said.
In total, nearly 25,500 people under the age of 18 were charged with crimes last year, according to data from the State Law Enforcement Division the committee presented Wednesday.

More than 1,600 of those were teens charged with weapons law violations, such as illegally owning or carrying a gun. Another 57 teens faced murder charges last year, according to committee data.
State law makes it illegal for a teenager younger than 18 to buy or carry a gun, and there are plenty of laws about juvenile delinquency and rehabilitation. That is clearly not enough to stop teenage crime, Cox said.
Over the next two weeks, the committee intends to come up with legislation to try and get guns out of teenagers’ hands as quickly as possible.
That could mean filing a new bill based on input the committee receives from agency heads and members of the public. Or, it could mean revisiting some legislation in the works for years, such as bills meant to address overcrowding at juvenile jails, Cox said.
“It’s a heavy task, but it’s going to be worthwhile for sure,” Cox said.
Once it has legislation for the coming year drafted, the committee will continue to meet and attempt to come up with solutions to more complex issues that lead teens down violent paths, Cox said.
SC juvenile justice changeups add capacity to reduce overcrowding, violence

The ultimate goal is to create a “pipeline from birth to 18 that keeps these children that we want to love on from entering that system,” Cox said, without giving any specifics.
Among the questions legislators want to answer are how children as young as 10 are getting access to guns and what role teachers might play in identifying at-risk students, legislators said. Also of common concern was how to address backlogs in the Family Court system, said Rep. Heath Sessions.
“This issue seems to have a lot of those tentacles,” the Rock Hill Republican said.
Earlier this year, the Legislature funded three additional Family Court judges, bringing the total to 66 statewide, at the request of state Supreme Court Chief Justice John Kittredge.
Kittredge told House budget writers in February that the need was much greater for a court system in “crisis.” But to keep costs down, he said, he focused this year’s request on three judges in the fastest-growing areas.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-05-at-3.49.34-PM-1024x554.png,,,2025-11-05 17:56:54.636805

The report does not indicate the size of the ransom asked, nor whether an attacker has been identified. Officials in the governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday afternoon.
About 90% percent of the data has been recovered, while the rest “is not required to restore essential services state systems and is being reviewed on a risk-basis,” the report says.
Although the cyber attack wasn’t detected until August, the “threat actor” had infiltrated state systems three months earlier, “escalating their access” and ultimately causing “a system outage that resulted in multiple virtual machines going offline,” according to the report issued by the Governor’s Technology Office.
That in turn prompted the state to take down multiple systems.
The Governor’s Technology Office and with assistance of private sector firms and federal agencies, were “successfully able to restore the majority of data within 28 days,” the report says.
“Nevada’s teams protected core services, paid our employees on time, and recovered quickly—without paying criminals,” said Gov. Joe Lombardo in a press release accompanying the report.

Supreme Judicial Court justices on Wednesday seemed torn between respecting two core constitutional guarantees – the right of defendants to legal representation and the separation of powers that gives the Legislature authority over appropriating state money.  
Over the course of 70 minutes of arguments by the two sides, and pointed questioning from the justices, none of the SJC’s seven judges appeared eager to snatch the power of the purse from Beacon Hill lawmakers. 
Public defenders in Middlesex and Suffolk counties have been overwhelmed by their caseloads since May, when the private attorneys that represent most indigent defendants stopped working to protest persistently low wages.  
The Legislature in July took a swing at addressing the bar advocates work stoppage by raising hourly wages $20 over two years. But the public defenders say the lawmakers didn’t go far enough, and they’re asking the court to order better pay rates to ensure that the thousands of defendants impacted by the stoppage have access to lawyers.  
The Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS), the public defender office that oversees the state’s bar advocates, asserted in its arguments that justices have both the power and responsibility to remedy this serious constitutional conundrum.  
As of Wednesday, more than 900 defendants in Middlesex and Suffolk counties have no lawyers, CPCS attorney Rebecca Jacobstein told the justices. More than 100 new people are coming in with new cases each week, she said. 
“Legislative action, which has improved the problem, has definitely not solved it,” she said. But the SJC should simply set a new rate until lawmakers improve their offer, she said. 
The lower courts and prosecutors have a different request for the justices: respectfully, stay in your lane. They urged the SJC to stay out of the rate-setting showdown.  
“The power at issue in this case is fundamentally and quintessentially legislative,” Assistant Attorney General Marina Pullerits said on behalf of the district courts and Boston municipal courts. The lower courts’ position, she said, is “there should be no circumstances where the courts cross one particular line, and that is judicial rate setting.”  
Courts are loathe to insert themselves into the business of other co-equal branches of government. State law gives the Legislature the power to set the pay rate for bar advocates – who handle roughly 80 percent of indigent criminal defense cases in Massachusetts.  
Pay for Massachusetts bar advocates has long lagged other New England states. Bar advocates in Massachusetts make $65 an hour, while advocates elsewhere in the region make more than $100 an hour.  
When the private attorneys stopped work, the staff lawyers at CPCS were immediately overwhelmed and unable to keep up with the caseloads. 
All defendants are constitutionally entitled to legal representation, even if they can’t pay for it. In 2004, the SJC set out a protocol for how to handle cases when the state is unable to provide a lawyer to a defendant. In July, a single SJC justice green-lit the Lavallee protocol. This creates a special hearing process where judges order defendants released if they have been held without counsel for more than seven days or order their charges dismissed if they have lacked counsel for 45 days. 
Dismissed cases could be brought again, but without a resolution of the pay dispute there may still be too few lawyers to take up a case on another pass. Jacobstein said that this sticks defendants on a “merry-go-round.”  
The seriousness of the crisis is not in question. The courts, public defenders, and prosecutors all acknowledged that the pay rates are not high enough to attract the number of bar advocates needed to handle all of the criminal cases involving indigent defendants. The question is, who has the authority to do something about it? 
People may be released with serious criminal charges because they can’t access an attorney, noted Justice Frank Gaziano. He asked Assistant District Attorney Elisabeth Martino how public safety factors in, or if the expectation is that the high court must “just wait until something horrendous happens before we can act.” 
The process is unfolding as the state Constitution demands, attorneys for the courts and the district attorneys’ offices said. Dismissing the cases is the remedy for people without counsel, Martino said, and while she has “grave concerns for public safety,” she said, “political pressure cannot cause this court to overreach.” 
On the core constitutional question, Gaziano pointed out that 900 people without access to lawyers is “really bad.” 
Matino and Pullerits asked the court to let the process play out and declare that the judiciary should not be empowered to set pay rates for bar advocates. Justices could, Pullertis said, declare the rate too low but not set a higher one. 
There is a new incentive program to tempt bar advocates back which just started this past week, the legislative accord raising pay $20 would roll out over the next year and change, and CPCS should be able to hire more staff attorneys under the new law. Plus, the state inspector general has been asked to prepare a report on the impact of pay rates on indigent defense, and the Joint Committee on the Judiciary heard testimony on a proposal to raise bar advocate pay on Tuesday. 
Lawmakers are hardly rolling in unlimited funding, justices noted. Beacon Hill’s pay raise was more than CPCS initially requested, said Justice Scott Kafker, but it wasn’t enough for the private lawyers.  
“Can we really kick that amount up, just pick the number, or do we stay on our side of the separation of powers and do everything we can on our side?” he asked. “Because the Legislature’s got a lot of competing problems,” Kafker said, ticking off issues regarding the homeless, food assistance, and mental health care.  
“You have to do something,” Jacobstein responded. “Because right now we are in a perpetual state of emergency, where people are perpetually not getting lawyers. … It’s just not okay.” 
CPCS will ask Justice Delila Wendlandt, in a single justice hearing next week, to refine the Lavallee protocol. The time frames should be shorter, Jacobstein said, and cases should be dismissed without prejudice so the same defendants can’t be hauled in on the same charges over and over again. 
Far from the courts violating the separation of powers under Article 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, she said, “right now it’s the Legislature that’s violating Article 30” by underfunding a core piece of the judicial system and hampering its ability to operate. 
The ACLU of Massachusetts submitted a brief in support of the bar advocate pay raise. Its legal director, Jessie Rossman, said in a statement after Wednesday’s arguments that the court should declare the current compensation for bar advocates unconstitutional and immediately set a temporary rate “until the Legislature develops an adequate solution.”  
“When the state fails to create a system where indigent defense attorneys can afford to do their work, the most vulnerable defendants pay the cost,” Rossman said. “That is exactly what we’ve seen over the past five months, with more than 7,000 indigent defendants going without representation. But this problem is not new, and neither is the court’s role in resolving basic constitutional violations. Given the Legislature’s repeated failure to sufficiently address this crisis over the past 20 years, the court must step in and exercise its authority to protect the constitutional right to counsel.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/masscourts2-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C520&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-05 17:56:54.636805

The only federal candidate to file Wednesday was Republican U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers for reelection in the 5th Congressional District in Eastern Kentucky. 
Kentucky’s ballot will have a heated race for U.S. Senate next year as the longtime seat holder, Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, announced earlier this year he is not seeking reelection. 
Some U.S. House races will also be hotly contested. U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, a Republican, is seeking election to the U.S. Senate, leaving his 6th Congressional District seat open. Several Republicans and Democrats have launched campaigns for the office in Central Kentucky. 
The GOP primary in the 4th Congressional District also has gained national attention as President Donald Trump endorsed Shelbyville Republican Ed Gallrein to run against iU.S. Rep. Thomas Massie weeks ago. Northern Kentucky Republicans in the district will have to decide between Trumpism and Tea Party politics. 
Many candidates for Kentucky’s congressional seats had previously declared their intent with the Federal Election Commission, which requires them to regularly disclose how much money they are raising in financial reports.
During the filing period, candidates can also sign up to run for the Kentucky General Assembly as well as some regional and local offices. Several incumbent lawmakers filed to run for reelection. 
The Kentucky Court of Appeals seat vacated by Supreme Court Justice Pamela Goodwine after she was elected to the high court last year will also be on the ballot. Fayette County Circuit Judge Lucy Ferguson VanMeter formally filed to run for the appellate court after announcing her candidacy earlier this year. The judgeship represents the 5th Appellate District, which covers Fayette, Madison, Franklin, Scott, Jessamine, Woodford, Clark and Bourbon counties. 
For candidates that plan to file their documents in-person at the Secretary of State’s office, they will have to go to the new location at 1025 Capital Center Drive in Frankfort.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Southern Vermont school board moves to close two elementary schools, going against residents’ non-binding vote to keep them open.","The Taconic and Green School District is moving forward with plans to close two elementary schools serving Danby, Mt. Tabor and Sunderland students, despite residents in those towns voting in a non-binding referendum last week to keep the schools open.
During its Tuesday meeting, the school board voted 11-2 to close the Sunderland School and the Currier Memorial School in Danby, which serve grades K-6 and pre-K through grade 5  respectively.
Board members Ron Flynn and Rogan Lechthaler voted against closure. The board needed 10 of its 13 members to vote in favor of closure — a rule enacted during the 2017 merger and creation of the Taconic and Green School District under Act 46.

The Taconic and Green School District, part of Bennington-Rutland Supervisory Union, oversees four elementary schools and an elementary-middle school for nine towns including Manchester. Both the Sunderland and Currier Memorial schools currently have fewer than 50 students and are expected to continue seeing enrollment declines, board members said.
The costs of keeping the two schools open, school officials said, have prevented the district from providing equal learning opportunities to all students. The district’s other schools each have 30 to 40 kids per grade and enjoy more robust programming than what the smaller staff at the Sunderland and Currier Memorial schools can provide.
Taconic and Green school board Chair Melanie Virgilio, of Sunderland, said during the Tuesday meeting that the board members who voted for closure believe “that this will really be providing the best next steps for our kids in our communities.”
“I know none of us here are doing this with a light heart,” she said. “I don’t know how best to appropriately apologize, or say that we’re excited. There’s a lot of emotions around this.”
Both schools will close on July 1. The remaining students at the two schools would transfer to the Dorset Elementary School, while the district would shift all of its 6th- and 8th-grade students from the Dorset School to the Manchester Elementary-Middle School. Middle school students at the Flood Brook School would remain at that school.
Teachers and staff at the two schools, meanwhile, will be “reassigned by seniority,” according to Randi Lowe, the superintendent of the Bennington-Rutland Supervisory Union. She said in an email that “almost all, if not all, employees will have positions” in the district’s new configuration.
The vote to close the schools comes amid a tumultuous period of change for Vermont’s public education system. Act 73, the state’s sweeping education reform law, could soon transform how the system works and how the state pays for it.
The school redistricting task force is currently working to create no more than three possible map configurations to merge the state’s 119 school districts and 52 supervisory unions. The Legislature will consider those maps during their upcoming session in January.
In some areas of the state, Act 73 is already having an effect on how districts are structuring themselves. 
Danville voters will on Dec. 6 vote whether to shutter high school grades at the Danville School and switch to school choice after a resident petition was verified with enough signatures, according to Danville Town Clerk Michelle LeClerc.
That petition was partly spurred by fears that the Vermont Legislature was likely to pass legislation to restrict school choice for districts that close their schools — a sentiment that others have contested.
But in places like the Bennington-Rutland Supervisory Union, the changes being considered predate the state’s new reform efforts.
Plans for a regional middle school have been in the works at the Bennington-Rutland Supervisory Union for several years, while plans to close some of the Taconic and Green School District’s five schools have been in discussion for at least a year.
Still, the new law’s provisions for when to close smaller schools appeared to, at least in part,  motivate the board’s vote to close.
“We have no idea what the state’s going to do, and we can’t guarantee that closing these schools” would protect the school district and supervisory union from getting split apart,” board member Alex Wilde said Tuesday. “Not closing the schools is almost certainly going to let them just tear us to shreds.”
The board is committed to these plans, despite a majority of residents in the three towns voting in an Oct. 28 non-binding referendum against the two schools’ closure.
Just under 20% of registered voters in each town participated in the referendum, according to the results. Danby residents voted 148-46 to keep the schools open, while Mt. Tabor residents voted 22-6. The vote was closer in Sunderland, where 101 residents voted to keep the schools open, versus 73 who voted to close.
Lowe said that the results “were not unexpected and do not raise any additional concerns.”
“We are committed to a transition to new school communities that centers our students and their needs,” she said in an email.
During the Tuesday board meeting, several board members said they were disappointed in the low percentage of residents that voted. Some board members said much of the email correspondence they received in the days leading up to the vote were in favor of closing the schools.
“I don’t know where the ‘no, keep our schools’ emails were, but … it puts us in a tricky spot where the emails are saying one thing but the vote is clearly saying the opposite,” board member Jon Wilson said.
Still, most board members said they felt closure was needed. Wilson, who voted to close both schools, said Tuesday that he felt “like a villain doing that.”
“These schools both have long histories. We’re talking about the death of schools,” he said. But he voted for closure “because, as a school district, I don’t believe we can fulfill our potential if we keep those schools open. That’s sad to say and probably not making me any more friends, but that’s what I believe.”
On Tuesday, Virgilio said that further declines in enrollment at the schools were inevitable. When Currier Memorial School first opened in 1966, she said, there were 200 students there.
“That’s not there anymore,” she said. “I can’t see Danby growing exponentially in the near term, and I can say the same thing about Sunderland.”
While she remarked that these schools had “vibrant communities” in year’s past, she noted “that is not the reality of today, and I don’t see it going back, unfortunately.”

(Getty Images)Elementary and middle school administrators in a Central Arkansas school district ordered faculty and staff to remove a book from library shelves in October after a parent complained it was “grooming” children by portraying LGBTQ+ characters.
Michael Moon submitted a library book challenge form to the Benton School District on Oct. 2 asking for the novel “Jo: An Adaptation of Little Women (Sort Of)” by Kathleen Gros to be removed from the library at Mountain View Middle School.
On Oct. 7, the school’s principal, assistant principal, media specialist and two language arts teachers “met and determined the book ‘does not meet the selection criteria and needs to be moved from the library,’” according to internal Benton School District correspondence the Advocate obtained Tuesday via a public records request.

Benton documents 
All Arkansas schools are required to have library content challenge policies in place, and Act 372 of 2023 put the final say on the availability of challenged books in the hands of school boards. District correspondence does not indicate that the complaint reached the school board before Mountain View Principal Chris Johnson informed two district superintendents in an Oct. 7 email that the challenged book would be removed from the school library.
In his challenge form, Moon said the novel reimagining the classic “Little Women” had “no pedagogical purpose” and instead had “a pedophilia purpose.”
“My wife and I believe that the intention of the author is to pervert children’s sense of self and is therefore not only morally bankrupt, but also reveals the very sinister nature of the author,” Moon wrote.
A day earlier, Moon posted his opposition to the book on social media, and Mountain View Middle School Media Specialist Kristn Spadaro “let administrators know that the book was considered inappropriate” and that including it in the library was an oversight on her part, according to district documents.
Spadaro cited both Act 372 and Act 917 of 2025 as reasons to remove the book from the library. Act 917 of 2025 requires public elementary schools to “store non-age-appropriate sexual content, including without limitation a book or other resource that is located in the library media center that is available to the public, in a locked compartment within a designated area.”
Law limiting access to LGBTQ books in school libraries began with rural Arkansas district

Act 917 developed from parental complaints against LGBTQ+ books available in the Mountain Pine School District in 2023. The law applies to grades K-5, and Mountain View Middle School contains grades 5-7.
Later on Oct. 1, Angie Grant Elementary School Principal Stephanie Givens emailed school staff and told them the district requested the removal of two books, including the book Moon challenged.
“You may store them in my office if needed,” Givens wrote, attaching photos of the Kathleen Gros novel and “From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler” by E.L. Konigsburg.
A local conflict
Benton is the county seat of Saline County, a hotbed of conservative efforts against the availability of LGBTQ+ books to minors. In April 2023, Saline County Library Director Patty Hector refused to relocate books at the request of the all-Republican Saline County Quorum Court.
The quorum court responded by voting to give County Judge Matt Brumley hiring and firing power over library staff, and Brumley fired Hector in October 2023. Hector sued the county and Brumley in federal court earlier this year, alleging unconstitutional retaliation and violation of her free speech rights. 

Fired library director sues Central Arkansas county, alleging retaliation and First Amendment breach


In October, Moody denied the defendants’ motion to have Hector’s claim of unconstitutional retaliation dismissed. The case is set to go to trial before U.S. District Judge James Moody in July 2026.
The quorum court asked Hector to keep certain books away from minors shortly after Act 372 became law. In July 2023, U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks temporarily blocked two portions of the law from going into effect: the provision that gave city and county officials authority over challenged library books and a provision that created criminal liability for school and public librarians who distribute content that some consider “obscene” or “harmful to minors,” two terms the law does not define.
Brooks made the injunction permanent in December 2024, and the state appealed the ruling in January.
The 18 plaintiffs in the lawsuit did not challenge the portion of Act 372 giving school boards authority over challenged library content.
 Legal advice

Two weeks after Benton school officials ordered two books hidden from students, the North Little Rock School District ordered staff to block students’ digital access to dozens of LGBTQ+ books. Administrators called it “a proactive step to ensure all content used in our classrooms is appropriate for our students and respectful of family beliefs.”
North Little Rock School District orders 50 LGBTQ+ books hidden on students’ digital platform

Several parents expressed opposition to the decision, calling it censorship and unrepresentative of all NLRSD families, in emails to the district that the Advocate obtained via a public records request.
As of Wednesday, NLRSD spokesperson Dustin Barnes had not responded to emails from the Advocate asking what prompted the memo.
In an October statement to the Arkansas Times, Barnes said: “The North Little Rock School District is bound to comply with all state laws while continuing to foster a rich learning environment that values respect, belonging, and academic growth for every student. Our actions are not based on individual or personal beliefs, but rather on the need to adhere to state law and maintain consistency across our schools.”
The Times reported that attorney Jay Bequette recommended hiding the books in question from students after NLRSD administrators asked for his guidance in response to a parent’s complaint.
Bequette is a partner at Little Rock law firm Bequette, Billingsley & Kees. Another partner at the same firm, Cody Kees, assisted the Benton School District in its response to the Advocate’s public records request about its removal of books.

Laura Kelly earns endorsement from a Republican-controlled Senate committee.,"The Kansas Senate's confirmations committee endorsed Gov. Laura Kelly's selection of Manhattan businessman Matt Crocker to the Kansas Board of Regents during a hearing at the Capitol on Nov. 5, 2025. The committee wants Kelly's second nominee, Peter Johnston of Salina, to undergo further legislative review. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas Senate committee voted Wednesday to recommend confirmation of a Manhattan businessman to the Kansas Board of Regents and to direct a Salina attorney nominated to the higher education board to undergo additional vetting by legislators.
The Senate Confirmation Oversight Committee agreed to advance to the full Senate the nomination of 11 people to serve on state commissions, boards, authorities or to be promoted by the Kansas National Guard.
The committee embraced Gov. Laura Kelly’s nomination of Matt Crocker, recipient of bachelor’s and master’s degrees in business from Kansas State University, to the Board of Regents. The nine-member board appointed by the governor has responsibility for more than 30 public universities, community colleges and technical colleges across the state.
Crocker works as chief executive officer of SBS Companies, a collection of nine metal distribution companies based in Manhattan.
“We employ over 1,300 employees across 14 states and Mexico — the majority of which are blue-collar,” said Crocker, who previously was employed at Koch Industries, a predecessor to Evergy and at Citadel hedge fund in Chicago. “I believe that I will bring a robust set of experiences and perspectives to the regents role.”
Senate Majority Leader Chase Blasi, R-Wichita, asked whether Crocker thought Kansas State administrators had been sufficiently innovative in terms of its approach to reforming higher education.
Crocker said universities nationally were too rigid in terms of promoting change and could miss opportunities to get more out of investments derived from taxpayers or the private sector.
“When you have limited resources, you need to make sure that you’re utilizing those in the most efficient and effective manner,” Crocker said.
Blasi asserted Kansas State hadn’t taken proper steps to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs from its campuses. DEI programs were designed to create fair and welcoming environments within companies or at colleges, but DEI has been targeted for elimination by Republicans in the Kansas Legislature.
“In fact, they seem like they were focused on rebranding DEI,” Blasi said. “We keep hearing about K-State not doing what they’re supposed to be doing. So, could you look into that?”
Peter Johnston, a Salina attorney with a practice concentrated on health care law, had his nomination to the Board of Regents referred to the Senate Education Committee. His credentials and temperament to serve on the board would be scrutinized by that committee during the 2026 legislative session prior to consideration by the full Senate.
Johnston, who earned English and law degrees at University of Kansas, said he served as primary attorney for Salina Regional Health Center and was associated with hospitals in Lindsborg, Concordia, Abilene and elsewhere in Kansas.
“I want to serve on the Board of Regents because the public schools in the state have given me virtually everything that I treasure in my life,” he said. “It’s an opportunity for me to give back.”
Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican running for governor, said he received calls questioning Johnston’s nomination. Masterson said there was concern Johnston might not be fair to all public colleges and universities in the state. The skepticism was based on a report Johnston made “pretty disparaging remarks” about one of the state’s universities, Masterson said.
“I’m concerned about … your ability to look at some of the other institutions that may not be your preferred institution,” Masterson said.
Johnston said he wasn’t the “KU” appointee to the Board of Regents and that he would dedicate himself to serving the entire higher education system.
In addition, Masterson said referral of the nomination to the education committee was warranted because of an email Johnston sent to his own state senator in opposition to a proposed constitutional amendment allowing direct election of Kansas Supreme Court members. The amendment, championed by Masterson, will be on the ballot in August.
“I’m not saying, ‘No.’ I just want more time,” Masterson said. “We have precedent for this.”
In 2022, the Senate Education Committee was assigned the task of reviewing three Kelly nominations to the Board of Regents. That list consisted of former BNSF Railway executive Carl Ice, retired Kansas City school superintendent Cynthia Lane and former banker and state Sen. Wint Winter. The committee declined to endorse Lane and Winter, but all three nominees were confirmed by the Senate.
Much of that spotlight was on Winter, a former Republican senator who opposed reelection of Gov. Sam Brownback in 2014.
“For the record,” Masterson said, “I was originally opposed to him (Winter), became a supporter of him … and became very pleased with his activities on the board.”
Other nominees endorsed Wednesday by the Senate committee included Kansas Air National Guard Col. Kent Crane to the rank of brigadier general, Natalie Haag to the Kansas Racing and Gaming Commission and Dave Harrison to the University of Kansas Hospital Authority.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Matt-Crocker-nominee-regents-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-05 17:56:54.636805

During a meeting of the Idaho Legislature’s Natural Resources Interim Committee at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise on Monday, Fredericks briefed legislators on predators such as wolves and grizzly bears.
So far in 2025, Fredericks said investigators have found that 23 cattle, 43 sheep and one dog were confirmed, probably or possibly killed by wolves. 
That’s down significantly from 2022, when Idaho Department of Fish and Game officials reported 84 cattle and 192 sheep losses attributed to wolves. 
When wildlife officials investigate a report of a predator killing or injuring livestock, their reports conclude one of four possible outcomes when it comes to likelihood the predator was responsible: confirmed, probable, possible or unknown. 
Depredation is the term that state officials and wildlife managers use to refer to livestock that were killed or injured by predators.
“I will say that depredations have continued to decline in recent years – not that it’s still not significant in some areas and for some producers – but we have seen a decline in wolf depredations recently,” Fredericks said during Monday’s meeting.
 Livestock deaths have declined. So has Idaho’s wolf population.

One possible reason that livestock deaths have declined is because Idaho’s wolf population has declined as the Idaho Fish and Game Commission and Idaho Legislature pass policies designed to reduce the wolf population by killing wolves. 
The 23 cattle and 43 sheep killed by wolves represents a tiny fraction of the livestock population in Idaho. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Idaho has about 2.5 million cattle, including calves, and about 235,000 sheep, including lambs. 
Idaho Department of Fish and Game estimates Idaho’s wolf population decreased to 1,235

Fredericks told legislators that the confirmed, probable and possible cattle and sheep losses he presented represent the minimum number of wolf kills. In some cases, investigators may not be able to determine how livestock died or may never be called out to investigate.
“That does not mean those were the only animals that were killed by wolves,” Fredericks said Monday. “Those were the ones that we were able to have that determination.”
The state of Idaho has a compensation program to financially reimburse ranchers and livestock producers the fair market value of livestock killed by predators such as wolves or grizzly bears. From 2014 to 2022, Idaho’s wildlife compensation program paid out just more than $687,000 to 299 livestock producers who suffered verified livestock losses, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Wolves are a native species that was completely killed off in the American West by the 1930s due to widespread government poisoning and westward settlement. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the federal government reintroducing wolves into Idaho and Yellowstone National Park – one of the most successful and controversial wildlife recovery programs in American history.

“This reflects increasing demand for medical service, health care and data driven technologies,” said Mengjie Lyu, a senior researcher with the Economic Growth Institute.
For health care specifically, which is expected to increase by the highest number of jobs within the decade of 2022-2032 — nearly 47,000 jobs — Lyu added that this is “reflecting the impact of an aging population, the growing prevalence of chronic conditions, and higher levels of mental and behavioral health health service needs.”
On the other hand, mining is expected to decrease by the highest percentage of jobs in that time frame, while retail trade is expected to decrease by the greatest number of jobs. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Eight of the top 10 fastest growing occupations, Lyu noted, require at least a bachelor’s degree, and many require further education. The question of licensing and education was a further focus of the presentation. 
“We definitely need this overview as we go into what other kinds of careers can we attach to a high school education, and how can we help students find their way earlier in their career track,” noted Rep. Nancy DeBoer (R-Holland), who chairs the committee. 
“Michigan has fewer explicit occupational licenses than the national average,” Lyu stated. However, when looking at licensing barriers — additional requirements to do a job that are not directly attached to that career path — Michigan has significantly more than the national and regional averages. 
“These licenses and license barriers are concentrated in four major occupation groups, including health care practitioners, technical construction and extraction, personal care and service, and community and social service,” Lyu added. 
As for where job openings are coming from, the Economic Growth Institute’s research shows that, across industries, those are stemming from employees leaving a given industry — whether that be a career switch or retirement. 
“In other words,” Lyu said, “the majority of available job postings are driven by replacement needs, rather than the net expansion of the occupations.”
“The top 10 occupations with the greatest annual job openings are primarily entry level service and support roles, such as food service retail and largely driven by turnover, rather than the net growth,” she added. “These roles typically require little formal education or experience and offer modest wages, highlighting the need for career development, design and retention strategies in entry level service jobs.”
Ashlee Breitner, the director of the Economic Growth Institute, added that she hoped that the data “will help inform policy discussions on education, licensing and talent development.”

(Photo by Julia Shumway/Oregon Capital Chronicle)With some early childhood education centers already closing their doors because of the federal government shutdown, local leaders are scrambling to find money to keep Head Start programs available to some of the country’s most vulnerable children.
Head Start programs, which serve more than 700,000 low-income children across the country, are almost entirely federally funded. In addition to free preschool, centers provide health screenings, parent resources and meals for children up to 5 years old. But the record-long government shutdown has forced child care centers across the country to close as funding is exhausted.
The closures are creating stark choices for some of the most vulnerable families in society. Migrant farmworkers, for example, who are more likely to be without health insurance and tend not to have any vacation time, are faced with the prospect of missing work, and a paycheck, to care for their children. A network of Head Start programs for migrant farmworkers’ children that operates in states across the South closed its sites on Friday.
To keep Head Start programs operating in her state, Massachusetts Democratic Gov. Maura Healey announced plans to advance $20 million in additional funding for the program. Those grant funds were previously approved to improve and expand the Massachusetts program, which gets about 80% of its funding from the federal government.
In a statement last week, Healey said the state was doing everything it could to support those programs, “but we don’t have the resources to make up for what the federal government owes.”
In Atlanta, private funders made an $8 million loan to keep Georgia’s largest Head Start providers afloat for the coming weeks.
Frank Fernandez, the president and CEO of Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta, told CBS News that the measure was only a temporary solution: “Our elected officials must take action to end this shutdown and ensure the long-term sustainability of this critical program,” Fernandez said.
Local leaders rush to help, but can’t fill massive SNAP void

In Washington state, some school systems that operate Head Start programs are using their own funds to keep kids in classrooms, the Seattle Times reported. Still, other operations are cutting back staff and services to make do.
In neighboring Oregon, state officials are working out details of a 60-day deal to use existing funds to keep Head Start going, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported. State officials said Head Start providers must have experienced a delay in federal funds and the state assistance will not exceed the total amount of money awarded to a program by Oregon annually.
“It’s important to note that this is not a loan to Head Start programs and is not ‘backfilling,’” Kate Gonsalves, a spokesperson for the state’s early learning department said in a statement. “These are dual-funded programs so the state dollars are not replacing federal funds but can be drawn down earlier in the cycle.”
Some sites already shuttered
Head Start sites in 18 states have already closed their doors, according to the First Five Years Fund, a nonprofit advocating for quality child care and early childhood education.
The National Head Start Association, a nonprofit representing Head Start programs, said full or partial closures have affected 8,000 children. Nationwide, programs serving 65,000 children hadn’t received their federal funds as of Saturday, according to the group.
In Ohio, seven Head Start programs have exhausted their federal funds. Two have already closed, affecting 600 children and 150 employees. In the coming weeks, the Ohio Head Start Association says the other five will be forced to close their doors, affecting nearly 3,700 Ohio kids.
“Every day the shutdown continues, Ohio children and families are paying the price,” Julie Stone, Executive Director of the association said in a statement. “Head Start isn’t a political issue — it’s a lifeline for working families.”
Farmworkers’ children
Agricultural farmworkers, many of whom travel for seasonal work, have been hit particularly hard.
East Coast Migrant Head Start Project, which runs 43 Head Start centers in multiple states, suspended services on Friday. Around 1,200 children of agricultural farmworkers are without services now, but the number of children served fluctuates by season. The network is funded to serve 3,000 children of farmworkers across Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Virginia, and partners with other groups in a few other states.
In Florida, that means more than 800 children of agricultural workers are going without care due to the lapse in federal funding, said John Menditto, chief legal officer of East Coast Migrant Head Start Project. The group has also had to furlough its staff.
About 60% of farmworkers are American citizens or are in the country legally. Head Start is open to all children, regardless of their parents’ immigration status.
In rural North Florida, roughly 80 children have been without early education, language and disability therapies, said Leannys Mendoza Gutierrez, the campus director for the migrant Head Start program in rural Jennings, Florida, which cares for babies 6 weeks old to kids up to 5 years old.
“[Farmworkers] are putting food on our tables, for all of us,” she said. “However, they are not so far receiving services due to this situation that we don’t know when it’s going to end.”
Migrant farmworker families in Gutierrez’s program work in North Florida and South Georgia on watermelon, cucumber, cabbage, pepper, tomato, strawberry and pine straw farms.
Many parents have been forced to skip work and lose pay because they have been unable to find child care alternatives, Gutierrez said. She added that her program steps in to cover pediatrician bills for families that don’t have health insurance. The shutdown has prevented her program from offering such assistance, too, she said.
Many farmworkers don’t have health insurance and already struggle with poverty, making staying home from work difficult. Many also receive food aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which has also been affected by the shutdown.
“The shutdown just accentuates everything,” said Amy Liebman of the Migrant Clinicians Network, which works with clinics across the nation that serve migrant workers and their families. “Everyone’s concerned, they’re worried about the families they serve.”
Two other programs, one serving kids in the capital area of Tallahassee and another, Redlands Christian Migrant Association, which serves about 1,700 kids of agricultural workers in Florida, have also suspended services, according to the National Head Start Association.

(Photo by Laura Guido/Idaho Capital Sun) Delays and errors in Idaho’s annual statewide budget audit will likely lead to further delays and errors going uncorrected in next year’s audit. Those delays caused a delay in submission of a separate required audit of federal money, which is leading to questions from federal grantors. 
Idaho statewide audit finds significant errors in financial reporting driven by Luma system

Legislative Services Office Audit Division Manager April Renfro outlined issues in the state’s fiscal year 2024 state budget audit caused by the major transition to a new accounting and business system at a Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee meeting Wednesday at the Capitol in Boise. 
JFAC co-chair Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, said the delays and errors on the audit report prompted some “significant financial concerns,” related to the state’s bond rating and rates. Co-chair Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls, noted that Idaho’s AAA bond rating last month was affirmed by Moody’s Rating. 
Another audit that is required for entities that spend large amounts of federal money and grants is already delayed because of the work and issues on the Annual Comprehensive Budget Report, Renfro said. 
Many of the errors found in this year’s audit won’t have time to be corrected by the time the state has to submit another one in December, Renfro said. 
 “They will not have time, if we identify the error, to make corrections for fiscal year ‘25,” Renfro said. 
 Delays and significant errors could lead to future federal grants being under threat 

The report’s findings included financial misstatements of hundreds of millions of dollars for some agencies, duplicated payments, and a lack of processes to verify accuracy of statements between the State Controller’s Office, Idaho State Treasure’s Office, and the bank, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
The state is required to submit the report each year, but delays caused by the transition to the state’s new business and accounting management system, called Luma, meant it wasn’t complete until September, nine months after it was due. 
The state is also required to submit the Single Audit to ensure compliance with the law in expenditures of federal grants. The report was due in March, Renfro told lawmakers, but isn’t likely to be submitted until the end of this month. 
“We’ve had feedback from a couple of different agencies that grantors are threatening funding related to not having the Single Audit out,” Renfro said. “We’re doing the best that we can to get it out in time, but we also know we need responses from the agencies, so that’s why we’re pushing really hard to begin by the end of November.” 
 Issues in the annual state budget report stemmed from Luma transition 

The report looked at the state’s financial statements for fiscal year 2024, which ran July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, which coincided with the state’s bumpy overhaul of its accounting and business systems as it switched to Luma. 
This year’s audit included eight “qualified opinions,” meaning the finding was significant enough that there could be a material error in reporting, largely because the documentation wasn’t adequate for auditors to verify accuracy.
Auditors found in one case that the Department of Health and Welfare’s account overstated the cash on hand by $433.6 million, or the State Controller’s Office had overstated revenue by $102.3 million and expenditures by $178.3 million, among other errors in financial statements. 
Renfro told lawmakers Wednesday that in the more than 26 years she’s been with the legislative auditor’s office, she’s never seen the state get a qualified opinion before. 
Many of the issues were driven by a lack of process for reconciliation to verify numbers and statements between the agencies, the Idaho Treasurer’s Office, and the bank. There had been a process in place to do this prior to the switch to Luma. Auditors also found interface issues with Luma, a lack of appropriate reports being generated, and insufficient training on the new system. 
“Why is it important that you hear this?” Horman said to the committee members. “Because if you saw an agency in there that had a problem, a material misstatement and deficiency, sometimes you need to go in and add appropriation language to get them to comply.”

The organizations that administer Section 8 housing vouchers are running out of federal money, and they want the state to intervene to stop a downward spiral of the system.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
Facing federal funding cuts, local housing authorities are asking state lawmakers to help fund a key assistance program that helps thousands of Vermonters pay the rent.
Five of the nine public housing authorities that administer federal Section 8 housing vouchers in Vermont anticipate a budget shortfall totaling over $1 million in December, according to a presentation Kathleen Berk, executive director of the Vermont State Housing Authority, gave to lawmakers on Wednesday. 
“Simply put, there’s not enough money in the checkbook to make housing assistance payments for all households that are currently enrolled in the program,” Berk said in a subsequent interview.

The shortfall comes even after the local housing authorities tried to curtail spending. In January, Burlington Housing Authority suspended vouchers from people who were searching for a place to use them and vowed to give tenants who violated the rules fewer second chances before rescinding their rental aid. In May, the Vermont State Housing Authority stopped issuing new vouchers off its lengthy waitlist, effectively shelving vouchers after people gave them up.
Those measures were not enough to get the housing authorities within their budget authority set by Congress, however. 
As Vermont faces steep housing costs and persistently high levels of homelessness, federal housing vouchers play a crucial role in sustaining housing for low-income people who can’t afford market-rate rents. Voucher recipients pay a third of their income toward rent; a local agency administering the federal program pays for the rest. The vouchers offer one of the few avenues out of homelessness for the thousands of Vermonters sleeping in shelters, motels and outdoors.
The housing authorities have no plans to rescind vouchers to make up the budget gap, Berk said – at least for now.

For the month of December, the Vermont State Housing Authority, the largest housing authority in the state, plans to pool administrative funds to cover its budget gap, Berk said. Burlington Housing Authority, the second largest, plans to do the same, and expects the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development might repay them with special shortfall assistance funding, said BHA director Steven Murray.
A more dire situation could follow after the turn of the year, if Congress fails to pass a spending package. Public housing authorities are only funded through the end of 2025, Berk said. If the housing authorities do not have a budget by Jan. 1, they will not be able to make payments, she said. Berk doesn’t anticipate that situation to come to pass, however; she expects Congress to pass a short-term spending bill and for the federal government to reopen before that point, she said. 
Instead, she asked lawmakers to help staunch the slow bleed of Vermont’s voucher rolls with a one-time funding injection next year.
The federal government bases future years’ Section 8 voucher funding on past years’ spending by local housing authorities. That means as Vermont’s housing authorities cut vouchers this year, they’ll likely see reduced funding levels next year, leading to a “downward spiral” in the number of vouchers available to Vermonters, Berk told lawmakers.
The ask: an $18 million investment by the state to intervene on that spiral and fund 1,233 housing vouchers, maxing out Vermont’s voucher ceiling that’s currently authorized by the feds.
Berk hopes Vermont lawmakers will pass such a funding bill soon after the Legislature reconvenes in January. 
The chairs of the House and Senate committees on housing said they need to clarify exactly what the housing authorities need to stay afloat before committing to advocating for state funding for Section 8 vouchers. But they said they recognize they need to act.
“I think there is a growing consensus that … we have to use state funds to see if we can stop or slow this downward spiral loss of Section 8 vouchers,” said Rep. Marc Mihaly, D-Calais, chair of the House Committee on General and Housing.
If that loss isn’t stemmed, advocates fear Vermont will have fewer and fewer chances to transition people out of homelessness.
“If we have many less vouchers, moving people from being unhoused into housing is going to become nearly impossible,” said Gus Seelig, director of the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board.

,DC,2025-11-05 22:08:34+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump tariffs undergo intense scrutiny from US Supreme Court justices,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-tariffs-undergo-intense-scrutiny-us-supreme-court-justices,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court during lengthy arguments Wednesday weighed whether President Donald Trump violated the Constitution when he became the first U.S. president to impose sweeping global tariffs under an economic emergency powers statute usually reserved to combat rare and unusual threats.Justices in both the conservative 6-3 majority and liberal minority questioned the sweeping presidential power the administration is claiming under IEEPA, including Chief Justice John Roberts. Questions about how Trump officials interpret the statute and view its limits, or lack thereof, revealed their skepticism.Members of the president’s Cabinet, members of Congress and even comedian John Mulaney packed into the high court for the first major case of Trump’s second term to be fully argued before the justices. Tariffs are the centerpiece of Trump’s foreign policy, and he credits them in his recent negotiations to reach several unfinalized trade framework agreements with the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and China, among other nations.For nearly three hours the justices poked and prodded at the language of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, or IEEPA, a 1970s-era sanctions law that Trump has invoked since January in a series of emergency declarations and proclamations triggering import taxes on goods from nearly every country.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent sat shoulder-to-shoulder with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamison Greer. Not far down the crowded rows were U.S. House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Ed Markey of Massachusetts.Mulaney sat a few rows from the back, and was reportedly there to support former Acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal, who argued Wednesday on behalf of several private small businesses who sued Trump over the tariffs. Katyal, who served under President Barack Obama and hosts the “COURTSIDE” podcast, has collaborated with Mulaney on his show.Small business owners ‘footing the bill’The case centered on whether the president has unilateral authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA. Trump became the first president to ever invoke import taxes under the 1977 emergency powers law, which has traditionally used sanctions to control economic transactions of hostile groups and individuals. For example, IEEPA was first invoked during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis and later used to freeze assets of terrorist groups after 9/11. In all, presidents have declared 77 national emergencies under the statute.Small business owners who challenged Trump’s usage of the law argued the president doesn’t have the authority to tax them, and that the policy is upending their livelihoods. Since Trump declared emergencies around fentanyl smuggling and imbalanced trade relationships, U.S. businesses have been paying anywhere from 10% to upwards of 50% on imports, depending on country of origin.“It's American businesses like mine and American consumers that are footing the bill for the billions of dollars collected,” Victor Schwartz, founder and president of the family-owned wine and spirits importer VOS Selections and lead plaintiff, said outside the courthouse following arguments.Small businesses and Democratic state attorneys general led the charge in the two separate cases, consolidated before the Supreme Court. They allege Trump usurped taxing power, which belongs to Congress as outlined in Article I of the Constitution.Schwartz’s fellow plaintiffs included a Utah-based plastics producer, a Virginia-based children’s electricity learning kit maker, a Pennsylvania-based fishing gear company and a Vermont-based women’s cycling apparel company.Among the state officials who also joined the suit were state attorneys general from Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon.Two Illinois-based toy makers that primarily manufacture products in Asia filed a separate challenge.Solicitor general argues ‘power to tariff’The Trump administration argues tariffs are a necessary tool to achieve economic and national security goals. Officials claim the president’s power to impose duties under IEEPA is spelled out in the statute’s language authorizing the president to “regulate” importation and exportation during times of an “unusual and extraordinary threat.”“One of the most natural applications of that is the power to tariff,” U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer — the former Missouri solicitor general — said in response to questioning by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. “So when Congress confers the power to regulate imports, it is, naturally, conferring the power to tariff,” Sauer continued.Chief Justice Roberts asked Sauer to clarify the “major power” he claimed was granted in the statute.“The exercise of the power is to impose tariffs, right? And the statute doesn't use the word tariffs?” Roberts said.“But it uses the words ‘regulate importations,’ and historically, a core, central application of that, a big piece of that, has always been to tariff,” Sauer answered, speaking at a quick and excited pace.Many emergenciesJustice Elena Kagan asked Sauer why a president would ever use any of the other specific and constraint-bound tariff powers delegated by Congress if IEEPA “gives the president the opportunity to blow past those limits.”“Because if you look at Title 19 (of the U.S. Code), which is loaded with tariffs and duties of various kinds, all of them have real constraints on them. They are, you know, you can't go over X percent, or it can't last more than one year. And of course, the way you interpret this statute, it has none of those constraints,” Kagan said.Sauer responded that IEEPA “has its own constraints.”“The president has to make a formal declaration of a national emergency, which subjects him to particularly intensive oversight by Congress, repeated natural lapsing, repeated review reports and so forth,” he said.Kagan swiftly interjected: “I mean, you yourself think that the declaration of emergency is unreviewable, and even if it's not unreviewable, it is, of course, the kind of determination that this Court would grant considerable deference to the president on, so that doesn't seem like much of a constraint.”“And in fact, you know, we've had cases recently which deal with the president's emergency powers, and it turns out we're in emergencies, about everything all the time, about like half the world,” Kagan said, to laughter in the courtroom.Trump has petitioned the high court numerous times in 2025, putting cases regarding mass layoffs and immigration on the justices’ unofficial shadow docket, which bypasses a full argument process.Trump comfort with tariffsJustice Brett Kavanaugh asked why of the nearly 70 emergencies declared under IEEPA in past decades, none of them have invoked tariffs as a solution.“Why do you think Presidents, Clinton, Bush, Obama, have not used IEEPA to impose tariffs? Because there have been trade disputes, certainly President Bush, steel imports and the like. Why do you think IEEPA has not been used?” Kavanaugh asked.Sauer answered: “When you go through them one at a time, which we had our team do, it's really hard to find one when you look at that emergency, you say, ‘Oh, tariffs is the natural tool you would use to address that emergency.’”There are also “political reasons,” Sauer added. “I think that it's no question that President Trump is by far the most comfortable with the tariffs as a tool, both economic and foreign policy, than many of others.”Fentanyl smuggling targetedTrump began imposing tariffs under IEEPA through a series of executive orders and proclamations in February and March on products from China, Canada and Mexico, declaring these countries responsible for illegal fentanyl smuggling into the United States.The president escalated the emergency tariffs over the following months on goods from around the globe, declaring trade imbalances a national emergency. In addition to a baseline 10% global tariff, Trump specifically targeted countries that export more goods to the U.S. than they import from U.S. suppliers.As recently as late August, Trump imposed an extra 25% tariff on goods imported from India, bringing the total tariffs on Indian products to 50%, because of the country’s usage of Russian oil. In early August, Trump slapped a 40% tax on all Brazilian goods after he disagreed with the country’s prosecution of its former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro for plotting a coup to remain in power in 2022.",,,,2025-11-05 17:17:21.543071

WILMINGTON, Del. — A group of Delaware residents, two gun-rights organizations, and a firearms dealer have asked a federal judge to temporarily block Delaware’s new handgun permit-to-purchase law before it takes effect Nov. 16, arguing the state is not prepared to issue permits and that enforcing the law now would amount to a de facto ban on handgun sales.
Lawsuit targets rollout, not the concept of permits
In a complaint and motion for expedited injunctive relief filed Nov. 3 in U.S. District Court, the plaintiffs seek to halt enforcement of Senate Substitute 1 for Senate Bill 2 until the state demonstrates it can accept applications, process them within the statute’s 30-day window and issue permits. The case names as defendants Joshua Bushweller, secretary of the Department of Safety and Homeland Security, and Col. William Crotty, superintendent of the Delaware State Police, in their official roles.
Plaintiffs include attorneys Thomas S. Neuberger and Jerry L. Martin; William R. Hague Jr.; Bruce C. Smith; Bridgeville Kenpo Karate, Inc., doing business as BKK Firearms; the Delaware State Sportsmen’s Association; and the Bridgeville Rifle & Pistol Club.
What the law requires
The 2024 law requires most buyers to obtain a “handgun qualified purchaser permit” before purchasing a handgun. To get a permit, applicants must submit fingerprints, undergo state and federal background checks, and complete a state-approved safety course that includes live-fire training with at least 100 rounds.
State says the system is live
State officials say the core application system is operating. As of Oct. 28, 2025, the Delaware State Police, through the State Bureau of Identification, launched the Permit to Purchase Application Portal, which is live and accepting applications. According to the state, applicants can review requirements, schedule fingerprinting, upload training certificates and identification, and submit applications online through the state police website.
Plaintiffs say the infrastructure still isn’t ready
The suit argues that key elements remain incomplete and that, in practice, buyers cannot reliably obtain permits before enforcement begins. The filing cites gaps in training-instructor approvals and questions whether the state can meet the 30-day issuance timeline. It also points to what plaintiffs describe as internal contradictions in the statute and rules that, they say, invite uneven enforcement.
Jeff Hague, president of the Delaware State Sportsmen’s Association, disputed the state’s readiness, saying the online portal does not resolve deeper problems. “The infrastructure to properly implement the process [isn’t there]. Plus the law has contradictions in it,” Hague said. He added that the background-check system needed to run the law — the Firearm Transaction Approval Program (FTAP), passed in 2022 — “has not been implemented” and is “almost three years behind schedule.” Hague also said “the state is haphazardly putting procedures in place” and has “violated the Administrative Procedures Act by requiring instructors to be certified by the state.”
Attorney General defends the policy
Attorney General Kathleen Jennings has strongly backed the law as a moderate, constitutional measure intended to reduce gun violence. “This bill is being done for one reason and one reason only — to save lives,” she said during the 2024 debate, later calling it “a fundamentally moderate, and clearly constitutional proposal.” Jennings has emphasized fingerprinting, background checks and live-fire training as reasonable steps and has pointed to research and polling she says support permit-to-purchase systems.
Claims and requested relief
Plaintiffs say the state’s unfinished permit process would amount to a de facto banThey also raise due-process and search-and-seizure concerns, including a section allowing police to “take action” to remove a handgun if a permit is revoked.
The lawsuit asks the court to pause enforcement until the state files sworn statements that all systems, personnel and procedures are in place, allows a reasonable window for applicants to complete training and other steps, and shows that at least one permit has been issued.
What’s next

(Julia Goldberg/Source NM)Native American activists from the group Protect Dinétah on Wednesday staged a protest in the parking lot of the federal Bureau of Land Management offices in Santa Fe to register opposition to forthcoming sales of oil and gas leases in New Mexico.
According to a BLM news release last summer, the agency has an oil and gas lease sale scheduled for Thursday of 21 oil and gas parcels totaling 8,843 acres in New Mexico and Oklahoma. Seven of the parcels are administered by BLM’s Farmington and Rio Puerco field offices and, according to the project description, once they are sold “the lease purchaser has the exclusive right to use as much of the leased lands as is necessary to explore and drill oil and gas within the lease boundaries.”
A sale also is scheduled for 10 nominated parcels of federal minerals in the Pecos District, according to the news release.
The protesters, from the Navajo Nation, exhorted the BLM to cancel the oil and gas sales in the Farmington and Rio Puerco areas. According to a news release from the organization, many community members also submitted a letter in September protesting the sales, which describes the sale as “part of a series of BLM actions that threaten land, air, water, sacred places, public health, and the global climate.”

That news release contends the BLM “failed to meaningfully analyze and address the cumulative impacts of fracking in the Greater Chaco Landscape,” and said the lease sale “will exacerbate the many harms of oil and gas extraction that frontline and Diné communities experience every day, including dangerous air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, toxic spills of liquid waste, destruction of sacred sites and places, degradation of local roads vital for community transport, and elevated risks to public health. Moreover, the BLM has failed to meaningfully consult with impacted and Indigenous communities on this lease sale.”
Half a dozen speakers reiterated the impact more oil and gas drilling would have in the region, and the disproportionate harm extractive industries have had on Native American communities.
“We cannot let the federal government steal more,” Cheyenne Antonio told attendees. “The BLM wants to wish you a happy Native American Heritage Month by selling your resources, by selling your water to oil and gas.”
The activists also said oil and gas drilling, particularly fracking, threaten local communities.
“Future fracking will poison the land where my indigenous community still thrives,” Phyllis Waukazoo said. “My elders are still raising livestock there today. Indigenous communities surrounding the greater Chaco area are already facing the hardship of no resources, besides the current community hardships that we face of traveling miles to transport supplies like food, propane, firewood and basic necessities. Now, we soon have to find good, clean, clear drinking water that won’t poison us.”
The protest follows an Oct. 30 letter from the U.S. Interior Department to pueblo and tribal governments, announcing that BLM would be considering a revocation of Public Land Order No. 7923, which created a 10-miles buffer of protection from oil and gas drilling around Chaco Culture National Historical Park.
New Mexico’s congressional delegation last week issued a statement condemning the Trump administration for seeking to remove the protections.
Pueblo leaders urge federal government to protect ‘living history’ at Chaco Canyon

“Chaco Canyon is one of the most important living cultural landscapes on the planet,” the delegation said in a statement. “It holds deep meaning for many communities and Pueblos across New Mexico. By wrongfully revoking Chaco’s protections, the Trump Administration is hoping to allow new oil and gas development in the vicinity of Chaco Culture National Historical Park and the Chaco Canyon landscape. To deface and destroy this irreplaceable and sacred landscape is not only morally wrong: It is utterly disrespectful to the Pueblos, Tribal Nations, and New Mexicans who have called for permanent protection of the Chaco landscape.”
The protest also comes  as the Center for Western Priorities reports that as of Nov. 4, the Bureau of Land Management had issued more than 600 new permits to drill on public lands since the shutdown began. 
“Interior’s own numbers tell the story,” the center’s Deputy Director Aaron Weiss said in a statement. “While tens of thousands of park rangers and land managers are furloughed, [Interior Secretary] Doug Burgum is greenlighting oil and gas drilling at a rapid pace. That’s exploitation of our public lands, not stewardship. Approving more than 600 drilling permits and dozens of new leases while parks operate with skeleton crews shows this shutdown is being used to benefit oil and gas executives at the expense of our public lands.”
During the protest, Source NM spoke to a security guard within the BLM building who said no one was at work to respond to media questions, due to the federal government shutdown. An email to the New Mexico BLM media contact received an automated reply that the mailbox is not being monitored and “non-shutdown related queries” will receive a response “when appropriations have been enacted.” Source received a similar response by voicemail when leaving a message requesting comment at the BLM media field office—which had not been returned by publication.

Phil Murphy at his Statehouse office in Trenton on Nov. 5, 2025. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s incoming and outgoing governors met Wednesday in Trenton after Democrat Mikie Sherrill’s decisive election night win in the governor’s race, with each offering a wish list of what they hope to accomplish in their first and last days in office.
Talking to a crowd of reporters at his Statehouse office, Gov. Phil Murphy said he aims to end his second term with a ban on cellphones in schools in place, his latest round of medical debt relief carried out, and several stalled bills on criminal justice reform and housing signed into law (though he did not specify which bills).

“There’s a collection of housing bills that I would love to see get through, particularly given how expensive housing has become in New Jersey and the supply-demand imbalance,” Murphy said.
Sherrill said she and her transition team will spend the 76 days until her Jan. 20 inauguration hiring her executive team and planning for her first priorities — declaring a state of emergency to contain crippling electricity costs, acting to protect children’s online safety, joining court challenges to President Donald Trump’s tariffs, and drafting a state budget for the next fiscal year.
In keeping with her anti-Trump campaign theme, she also blasted his administration for federal funding cuts that have disproportionately impacted Democrat-led states.
“Certainly, I’m going to be working very hard to get resources, federal resources, back into New Jersey to discuss and take on the Gateway tunnel funding right away because that’s such a key issue and such a key economic driver here,” Sherrill said.
Trump has said he is canceling the Gateway project, which aims to build new rail tunnels into Manhattan. Critics of the move said it would cripple the economy.
Sherrill also listed schools as a priority, saying she would work with policymakers to address students’ sagging test scores and consolidate school districts. Some districts are so tiny that consolidating them would save taxpayers a bundle on bureaucracy and buildings, she said.

“I think we’re going to give some resources from the state to help people move towards that, especially at the administration level and especially with towns that aren’t even running a full K-through-12 school system,” Sherrill said. “It’s not just the people, it’s the buildings that they’re housed in, which are old buildings … that’s not where citizens in New Jersey want to spend their money. They want to spend it on kids and education.”
She also talked about Trump’s immigration crackdowns, saying she’ll act to require immigration agents dressed as if “they are going to Afghanistan” to be more identifiable.
“I’m committed to making sure people here feel safe, getting to school safely, getting to church safely, going to report crime safely,” she said.

“That is remarkable. That is historic, and we did it with a broad spectrum of folks in the electorate,” said Roberto Alves, the Danbury mayor and state party chair. “We had moderate candidates, we have progressive candidates. We are the big-tent party.”
Alves and Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat on the verge of kicking off a campaign for a third term, were quick to the point the Democratic successes in Connecticut and elsewhere as evidence of a party shaking off an election that gave Donald J. Trump control over the White House and Congress.
“Obviously, there was a lot of underlying concern about the dysfunction in Washington, D.C., the chaos in Washington, D.C., and just a sense that Connecticut is a bit of a safe harbor compared to what’s going on there,” Lamont said. But he added, “My message to the Democrats is just don’t run against Donald Trump. You got to tell people what you are for.”
Democrats now control municipal governments in 102 of the state’s 169 cities and towns, every congressional and statewide constitutional office, and two-thirds of the seats in the General Assembly. But the state also is one with a high cost of living, expensive energy and health costs, and high taxes.
Ben Proto, the Republican state chair, said the Democrats are less than credulous when they claim to be the party focused on making the state more affordable, not just committed to resisting the policies of the president.
“They’ve run completely against Donald Trump. The issue they don’t address when they talk about kitchen table is the issue of affordability and how totally unaffordable Connecticut is,” Proto said.
When the Democrats condemn the president for suspending the SNAP food assistance program, they are underscoring that the 360,000 SNAP recipients in Connecticut are evidence of an economic failure: About 10% of residents cannot afford to feed themselves, Proto said.
“What is their answer to the problem? Their answer is not make things more affordable, it is to give them more money to buy breakfast food and diapers,” Proto said. “The economy, that’s going  to be the issue next year. It’s not going  to be Donald Trump. It’s not going to be the shutdown.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DD4E3DB9-65FB-4B99-A7DE-3E75ADA9DAED-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-05 17:17:21.543071

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)New Mexico gubernatorial candidate Deb Haaland dropped 811 lbs of groceries off at an Albuquerque food bank Wednesday morning and urged other New Mexicans to do the same ahead of the holiday season. 
She delivered the food, which filled the bed of her pickup truck, to Roadrunner Food Bank, which is experiencing steep increases in demand amid nationwide upheaval in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Until the federal government shutdown prompted the abrupt halt to the program Nov. 1, SNAP helped feed about 42 million Americans each month, including roughly 460,000 New Mexicans. 
Over the last couple of weeks, more than 150 households have lined up for food donations at the bank’s daily distributions that occur Tuesday through Saturday, an increase of more than 50 households than usual, said Sarah Aragon, chief programs officer at the food bank. Food banks elsewhere in the state are seeing similar spikes.
Las Cruces food agency’s clientele swells amid SNAP uncertainty 

About one-third of the new wave of recipients, mostly families with children, have never received food donations before, Aragon told Source New Mexico. That’s a sign of the dramatic impact SNAP uncertainty is having on families, she said.  
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and state lawmakers late last month announced the distribution of $30 million in state funds to cover roughly 10 days’ worth of SNAP benefits. While the United States Agriculture Department has said it will comply with judicial orders to distribute about half of the typical benefits, President Donald Trump subsequently said no SNAP payments would be made until Democrats agree to end the shutdown.
Haaland, a former member of Congress, who became the nation’s first Indigenous cabinet secretary when President Joe Biden appointed her in 2021  to lead the Interior Department, is one of three Democrats seeking the party’s nomination in the June 2026 primary.
Food banks see sharp increase in demand amid federal SNAP uncertainty

When she learned Wednesday from food bank volunteers that the donation she delivered would be enough to provide 676 meals to families, her eyes welled with tears. She told Source in an interview later they were tears of gratitude toward her supporters who brought the donations to her campaign headquarters when she put a recent call out on social media.
“I spoke with one of the staff at the warehouse, and she mentioned that they need turkeys,” Haaland said. “So if anyone wants to buy an extra turkey and donate it to the Roadrunner Food Bank, they’ll distribute that to people, and someone will have a turkey for Thanksgiving.”
Haaland said she received emergency food stamps one November “many years ago” when she was a single mother. So she said she supports Lujan Grisham’s allocation of $30 million in state funds to pay for some of the gap in federal funding, and also favors the state continuing to pay for SNAP benefits after Nov. 10 if necessary. 
“Folks who don’t have food, that should not be a political football. We should all make sure that people have what they need,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1331-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-05 17:17:21.543071
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-05 21:58:26+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,"Unions: Buyout talks could affect 2,000+ state workers",Chris Lisinski,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/government/state-government/unions-buyout-talks-could-affect-2000-state-workers/,"Labor leaders say the Healey administration approached them to begin conversations about a buyout program that could reduce the state workforce by roughly 2,000 positions, the latest attempt at belt-tightening amid upheaval from the federal shutdown and funding cuts.","BUFFETED BY THE CROSSWINDS of federal funding cuts and preexisting budget pressures, the Healey administration drew heightened scrutiny to Beacon Hill’s spending and saving practices by floating the idea of cutting a sizable chunk of state jobs. 
Administration officials in recent weeks have approached at least four unions representing public-sector employees to begin discussions about a potential buyout program, the latest flashpoint in a debate about the use of state resources amid delays to food aid and cuts to child care programs. 
Buyout talks are preliminary, and Gov. Maura Healey said Wednesday that she has not made any final decisions. Still, the scope could be significant: two labor leaders told CommonWealth Beacon they think the administration is weighing ways to reduce headcount by 2,000 positions or more. 
Several union heads said the Healey administration has not yet provided many details about what’s on the table and which state agencies would be affected. 
“I’m actually quite befuddled that it doesn’t appear that anybody has a handle on the whole process,” said National Association of Government Employees president David Holway, whose union represents more than 15,000 state workers in Massachusetts. 
Chatter about trimming the state workforce burst into the spotlight on Tuesday, when the Boston Herald reported that SEIU Local 509 bosses informed their members that a possible voluntary buyout program was on the horizon. 
Higher-ups at three other unions — NAGE, AFSCME Council 93, and the Massachusetts Nurses Association — confirmed to CommonWealth Beacon they had been approached by the Healey administration to discuss the topic. None have agreed to any deal, and all are seeking more information from the state. 
Labor leaders said the administration is considering $20,000 buyouts for public-sector workers who retire and $10,000 buyouts for those not yet eligible for retirement, though Holway said the actual offers could vary by state agency. 
“It’s not written in stone and it’s not across the board,” he said. 
Holway said he believes Healey and her deputies are eyeing about 2,000 cuts between attrition and buyouts. Jim Durkin, director of legislation and political action for AFSCME Council 93, said the administration told his union it was considering leaving 1,100 vacant positions unfilled and cutting another 1,750 through attrition. 
“We heard about it, but they’re scant on the details and the agencies involved,” added MNA public communications director David Schildmeier, who added that “all the unions are looking for more specifics and who’s impacted.” 
Healey’s office did not provide details about the number of possible buyouts or the timing of any deal. 
But when asked about the topic during a radio interview Wednesday, Healey blamed President Donald Trump and his policies for inflicting upheaval on Massachusetts. 
“This is a hard time right now, given what’s happening, especially with the federal government and what Trump is doing to the economy,” Healey said during her latest appearance on GBH News’s Boston Public Radio. “We’re trying to work through all these issues right now. I’ve made no decisions about what’s going to happen with respect to state employees. It’s something we’re trying to manage.” 
“We can’t take care of people unless we have the people to do that work, so I’m very mindful of that,” she added. 
Buyouts in the state workforce are uncommon, but not unprecedented. The most recent instance appears to be 2016, when 900 employees accepted an offer from the Baker administration to retire early or leave their posts, saving a projected $82 million over two years. 
Massachusetts budget-writers have been stressed for months about a cascading set of factors eating away at any financial flexibility. State spending commitments have increased significantly in recent years as tax collections softened. 
Add in the dramatic policy changes enacted by the Trump administration, and the picture gets even darker.  
“If something dramatic doesn’t happen to reverse these federal cuts, then we’re looking at some really difficult times,” Durkin said. 
The Department of Revenue expects the federal reconciliation law will shrink state tax collections by $650 million this fiscal year. That package, sometimes called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, could also shrink health care funding for Massachusetts by more than $530 million in fiscal year 2026 and more in subsequent years, according to an analysis by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. 
“We’ve all been talking about the need to manage state spending growth in light of what the feds are doing and in light of ongoing budget pressures,” said Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation president Doug Howgate. “Exploring tools available to do that, including managing personnel costs, is the right thing to do.” 
SEIU Local 509 president David Foley said although he understands the state is caught in a bind as a result of federal action, he finds it “disappointing that the first step that we’re seeing here is a reduction in state workforce.” 
Instead, Foley wants Beacon Hill to pursue a new tax on multinational corporations — an idea other labor leaders have been pushing for months — or to dip into the state’s “rainy-day” savings fund. 
“Otherwise, it’s everybody fighting for themselves over where the austerity cuts will hit,” he said.

The rainy-day fund, also known as the stabilization fund, has a balance of about $8.6 billion. Anti-hunger activists have been targeting the account in recent days, urging the state to use some of that funding to replace federal food aid.  
SNAP’s outlook remains unclear after Trump suggested he would defy court orders and keep benefits on hold until the shutdown ends. 
The Raise Up Massachusetts coalition, an influential group of labor, business, and faith leaders, this week joined calls to fund benefits using state savings in the interim. 
“People cannot eat retroactively. We cannot wait for the funding to get to people from the federal government,” said Cindy Rowe, president of the Jewish Alliance for Law and Social Action. 
Top Democrats continue to resist, however, arguing that the scope of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is too large — more than $210 million per month in Massachusetts — for the state to absorb the costs even temporarily. 
Healey on Wednesday noted that other federal programs, including heating aid and Head Start child care, have also been disrupted as a result of the ongoing shutdown. 
“You’ve got to look at the whole picture of what’s happening, including these devastating Medicaid cuts. Trump and the Republicans have taken a trillion dollars of funding out of health care. That has a huge impact on states all over the country,” she said. “I am trying to do the best I can to manage the situation. It is absolutely unnecessary. It’s totally unacceptable. But no state can come forward and replace what the federal government has taken away.” 
One part of the Beacon Hill constellation might be softening on the idea of using stabilization funds. As Politico first reported, House budget chief Aaron Michlewitz wrote to ratings agencies last week asking how the state’s credit might be affected if it drew some money from the long-term savings account. 
“We wanted to be perfectly clear where the parameters were and what we are able to do to make sure our constituents can meet the challenges that are being faced by the federal shutdown,” House Speaker Ron Mariano said Monday. 
Beacon Hill power players have been wary to draw down savings after their willingness to do so in 2017 prompted S&P Global Ratings to downgrade the state’s bond rating, making it more expensive to borrow money and finance capital projects. 
Activists with Raise Up think the time for that degree of caution has passed. They point to a talk that S&P Global Ratings managing director Geoffrey Buswick gave in August, during which he suggested states can receive “the highest assessment score for our consideration of your reserve policies” if their long-term savings balances are 8 percent or more of annual general-fund spending.  
The $8.6 billion balance in Massachusetts’s rainy-day fund is about 14 percent the size of the fiscal 2026 state budget. 
“In our view, if you have had the wherewithal in good times to put money away for bad times, when those bad times, those rainy days are occurring, to draw it is not a credit negative,” Buswick said during a panel at the National Conference of State Legislatures summit in Boston. “We hear people all the time saying, ‘Oh, we can’t touch our rainy day fund. That would be terrible.’ If it’s raining, that’s what it’s there for.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11-03_Healey_leadership_1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-05 17:17:21.543071

Recently, the board charged 39-year-old Dr. Chinedu G. Ifejiagwa of Newton with professional incompetence for failing to exercise the degree of care expected of a physician, and with failing to report disciplinary action by a hospital.
The board alleges that in August 2022, a hospital the board has opted not to identify issued an emergency suspension of Ifejiagwa’s clinical privileges. Ifejiagwa later resigned from his position, which the board has not disclosed, at the hospital. According to the board, he then failed to disclose that suspension to the board.

The Board of Medicine has not publicly disclosed any information related to the charges of professional incompetence and, as part of a settlement agreement with Ifejiagwa, the board agreed to dismiss that charge.
As part of that same settlement agreement, Ifejiagwa agreed to have his license placed on probation for two years and submit to a clinical competency assessment.
Dubuque doctor faces second round of sanctions
The Board of Medicine also recently charged Dr. Barry J. Waack, an Iowa-licensed, family-practice physician from Dubuque, with unprofessional conduct.
The board alleged that Waack demonstrated “extreme rudeness” and exhibited dismissive behavior directed toward a patient and a nurse. The board has opted not to disclose when or where the alleged conduct took place.
To resolve the case, Waack agreed to a settlement that called for him to accept a warning from the board.
In 2018, Waack entered into settlement with the board that called for him to pay a $5,000 civil penalty, complete educational training on professional boundaries, and have his license placed on probation for three years.
That case stemmed from allegations that Waack violated professional boundaries, engaged in improper prescribing and established an inappropriate relationship with a patient. The board alleged Waack prescribed multiple medications for a subordinate female colleague with whom he was having a sexual relationship.
Waack is currently a defendant in a medical malpractice case brought by the family of Phillip French of Dubuque. According to the lawsuit, Waack saw French in the emergency room at Unity Point Health’s Finley Hospital in Dubuque on Aug. 27, 2022. The lawsuit alleges Waack negligently failed to perform a complete examination of French and order the appropriate tests, and that French died two days later.
Waack and the hospital have denied any wrongdoing, and a trial is now scheduled for Oct. 13, 2026.

On New Year’s Day 2020, Adam Tendler unexpectedly received his father’s final gift: a wad of cash stuffed into a manila envelope handed over in the parking lot of a Denny’s restaurant in West Lebanon, NH. The strangely furtive exchange launched a musical journey.
Tendler, a renowned concert pianist who grew up in Barre decided to use his inheritance to commission an all-star cast of modern composers to compose piano pieces exploring the theme of inheritance. In his pitch to his composer friends, Tendler wrote that he wanted “to plant that cash in the soil of something that may actually grow and — if you’ll forgive me — live on.” 
To his amazement, every composer he wrote to agreed to contribute. The result is a critically acclaimed album and concert tour called “Inheritances,” which the New York Times has called a collection of “little masterpieces.” Tendler will perform Inheritances at the Barre Opera House on November 16.
Tendler initially did not know what to do with the money that he received. Taking a trip or paying down a credit card seemed inadequate. “This is an inheritance so something should be done with it that sort of honors the gesture,” he told The Vermont Conversation. 
“The thing I do for a living is ideally creating experiences for people … which [are] cathartic and beautiful and [provide] a sense of connection,” he said. “What if I use it to facilitate that experience for people?” Tendler originally told his story in a 2023 essay for the New York Times, “My Father’s Death, An Envelope of Cash, A Legacy in Music.”
Adam Tendler is a Grammy-nominated pianist and a recipient of the Lincoln Center Award for Emerging Artists and the Yvar Mikhashoff Prize. The Minneapolis Star Tribune called him “currently the hottest pianist on the American contemporary classical scene.” After graduating from Indiana University, Tendler performed solo recitals in all fifty states as part of a grassroots tour he called America 88×50. He has appeared as soloist with the London Symphony Orchestra, LA Philharmonic, Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Toronto Symphony and at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center and other venues. He is on the piano faculty of the Steinhardt School at New York University. 
Tendler took a circuitous route from Barre to the concert stages of the world. After college, he worked at the landfill in Coventry and was a substitute teacher at U32 and Twinfield high schools. His relationship to his hometown is both affectionate and ambivalent. 
“I love Barre, I love Vermont, but it wasn’t really the most easy place to grow up as a queer kid,” he recalled. “Music was a safety hatch … a real place within which I could hide, protect myself, express myself. I created a little fortress within it.”
“That  vessel motivated me to actually start to really train to the point of getting into conservatory.”
Tendler said that his work on Inheritances transformed his complicated feelings about his “semi-estranged” father “into something that feels like a companion in a good way.”
“This project and having to sort of confront him on a human level, even though we’re talking about music, has brought me back to him. I am my father’s son. We are family.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-05 21:50:55+00:00,CT Mirror,Dems say elections show support for holding firm on health care,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/05/ct-democrats-government-shutdown-election-results/,Connecticut’s U.S. senators said the election results show voters want Democrats to keep pushing on health care amid the federal shutdown.,"Congressional Democrats say they feel emboldened in their push to preserve health care benefits amid the shutdown of the federal government after resounding victories in Tuesday’s elections in Connecticut and across the country.
The elections were seen as a potential barometer for how voters are feeling about the shutdown and whether it might be a turning point in the stalemate. The shutdown reached its 36th day on Wednesday, becoming the longest in U.S. history as SNAP beneficiaries await partial November benefits and travel delays persist.
As lawmakers in both parties try to assign meaning to the off-year elections that mainly happened in blue states, Connecticut’s U.S. senators are arguing that the favorable election results and the focus on affordability show voters want Democrats to keep pushing on health care, specifically the expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. And they believe that could bring President Donald Trump and Republicans to the negotiating table.“We just had a referendum on Dems’ approach to the shutdown, and even Trump admits it,” U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy said Wednesday, referring to the president’s comments that the shutdown was one of the reasons for Republicans’ electoral losses. “It sounds like it’s a good time for Democrats to make sure that we protect the people we said we’re fighting to protect.”

Connecticut’s senators aren’t involved in the beginning stages of negotiations among a group of bipartisan senators who are exploring ways out of the shutdown. Pressure is building to resolve it, with the uncertainty of nutrition aid and other services and a federal workforce that isn’t getting paid. A potential deal could involve passing some full-year funding bills and reopening the government if Republicans promise to hold a vote on extending the health care subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year.
But that framework is catching some flak from other Democrats. And Murphy and U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., maintain the party must hold firm and not accept any deal that undermines what they’ve been pushing for over the past month.
“It would be very odd, right after the country rewarded Democrats for taking a stand and fighting for us, to immediately stop fighting,” Murphy said.
For Blumenthal, a realistic compromise would include more than a “vague promise” that they’ll get a vote in the Senate to extend the enhanced premium subsidies, especially if the House has no commitment to bring it to a vote.
“I am unwilling to settle for a vote on some undetermined bill at some indefinite point in the future with no real commitment from the president or the speaker of the House, which seems to me a betrayal of all we’ve been fighting to uphold, and we’ve come this far,” Blumenthal said. “The American people seem to be on our side. We really owe it to them to stand firm at this point and say we need a commitment to extend the health insurance premium subsidy.”
In statewide and municipal races, Democrats had a good night across the board in the first major elections since the 2024 presidential election, when Republicans scored a political trifecta, winning the White House and both chambers of Congress.
Democrats won the governor’s mansion in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as a nail-biter race in Virginia’s attorney general race, where the Democratic candidate won despite the disclosure of violent texts suggesting a state GOP leader deserved to be shot. 
In Connecticut’s municipal elections, Democrats made big gains across the state, flipping seats controlled by Republicans in the cities of New Britain and Norwich and suburbs of Branford and Westport. Democrats also fared well by defeating GOP incumbents in Ansonia, Bristol, Stratford and Milford.
“In Connecticut, in the small towns and cities, we had a momentous blue wave,” Blumenthal said. “The national press tends to focus on New Jersey and Virginia and California. But what we’re seeing really is at the very grassroots local level, a really massive shift, a seismic shift in my opinion.”

But Republican leaders in Congress dismissed the idea that the shutdown played a role in last night’s elections. And they are still trying to put pressure on Democrats to support the short-term funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, that would reopen the government, though the bill that the Senate has repeatedly voted on would only keep things funded through Nov. 21. Lawmakers acknowledge they will likely need to vote on another one with a later date to give them more time to negotiate full-year spending bills.
“Surely Democrats have hit enough milestones. The election is over,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Wednesday morning as the Senate gaveled in. “So the question is … can the American people get a break now? Democrats should be embarrassed that federal workers are lining up at food banks and missing bills and in danger of losing homes or cars because Democrats can’t summon enough members to support a clean, nonpartisan funding resolution.”
That conflicted with Trump’s own assessment that the shutdown hampered Republicans on the ballot — as well as the fact that Trump wasn’t on the ballot and GOP candidates couldn’t benefit from any coattails.
“I think, if you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor,” Trump told reporters Wednesday as he met with Republican lawmakers for breakfast. “Negative for the Republicans, and that was a big factor. And they say that I wasn’t on the ballot and was the biggest factor. But I don’t know about that. But I was honored that they said that.”
Post-election, Democrats are renewing their push to meet with Trump and Republicans about the shutdown. But it is unclear where any meaningful negotiations stand beyond the group of bipartisan senators who are trying to break the impasse.
There’s still an indication Trump wants Republicans to do it on their own and circumvent the need for Democratic votes. The president is pushing for Republicans to get rid of the filibuster — the 60-vote threshold needed to advance bills in the Senate — but GOP leadership says the votes aren’t there to ax that procedure. Because of it, Republicans need at least seven Democratic senators to move most bills forward. Once they clear that procedure, only a simple majority is needed for final passage.
Trump has made repeated overtures over the years for Republicans to gut the filibuster, going back to his first term. Both parties have changed the rules over the past decade or so that have weakened the filibuster when it comes to executive nominations. But getting rid of it altogether would completely reshape the Senate and  and would significantly empower whoever is in the majority at that time.
But despite Trump’s demands, Thune said the votes aren’t there among Republicans to change the rules. And if there’s no real movement on ending the filibuster, Democrats like Murphy insist he’ll have no choice but to get involved in negotiations with both parties.
“Trump obviously wants desperately to get out of this shutdown,” Murphy said. “He tried one play this morning. And if that doesn’t work, his only other path is to come to the table.”
With a resolution still not in sight, the shutdown threatens to cause even more pain across the country as pressure builds to end it.
In addition to missed paychecks, federal nutrition assistance has taken one of the biggest hits. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, came to a halt starting Saturday in Connecticut and other states. Beneficiaries are waiting to see at least some of their benefits for the month of November after two federal judges ordered the Trump administration to use a special contingency fund to pay partial benefits.
With nutrition aid in limbo at the federal level, state lawmakers are looking to Gov. Ned Lamont to fill in gaps related to SNAP like the state did for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC, as well as for winter heating assistance through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP.
Two Head Start programs in Connecticut also saw a funding lapse over the weekend with grants that were expected to come through on Saturday: EdAdvance, a Regional Educational Service Center that serves western Connecticut, and Children’s Learning Centers of Fairfield County in Stamford. Between those centers, they have a combined 395 slots that serve children in Head Start and Early Head Start programs.
But they will continue to be operational and received help to keep things going at least through November through Connecticut’s Office of Early Childhood.
EdAdvance had said it will get some of its allotted state funding for the year early, executive director Jonathan Costa said. That will help EdAdvance stay open through November, though he noted they will need to evaluate things if the government remains closed heading into December.
Monica Maccera Filppu, the CEO of Children’s Learning Centers of Fairfield County, said “it is our intention to sustain services as long as we can.” They recently sent a message to families that they will stay open and “do not anticipate any immediate changes to our services.”
On top of the direct shutdown consequences, people in Connecticut and across the country are deciding whether to buy new health plans for 2026 with the enhanced premium subsidies set to expire. Open enrollment began over the weekend to purchase plans for next year on the state’s insurance exchange, Access Health CT.
But if those subsidies aren’t renewed before the end of the year, premiums are expected to rise. For those who earn less than 400% of the federal poverty level, they are likely to get less assistance. But those over the 400% will see their relief go away completely.
If the subsidies lapse at the end of December, Connecticut residents could see their premiums rise by an average of $2,380 per year — or about $198 a month — according to mid-October estimates provided by Access Health CT. A household of four would see premiums rise by an average of over $10,000 per year.
With costs piling up across various programs and services both related and unconnected to the shutdown, lawmakers say affordability is the defining election issue.
“The through-line in these elections is life today seems unaffordable for a lot of Americans when they buy groceries, pay their electricity bill, their rent or mortgage and yes, their health care,” Blumenthal said. “Health care was on the ballot. Affordability was on the ballot. And the results are plain to see.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stratford-2025-Election-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-05 16:57:17.676933

Supporters of State Question 837 were allowed to begin collecting signatures on Aug. 6. They needed 172,993 signatures by Monday to get it on the ballot.
Jed Green, a supporter of the citizen-led effort, on Monday notified the Oklahoma Secretary of State’s office that they were withdrawing the petition.
“While our effort has been extremely strong, it is apparent we will fall short of numerical sufficiency for a constitutional question,” Green wrote.
Green could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
Supporters had hoped to become the first initiative petition to qualify for a ballot under a new more arduous process signed into law in May.
Senate Bill 1027 puts more restrictions on the process voters use to get issues on the ballot. Among other things, it puts caps on the number of signatures that can be collected by county.
The measure has drawn legal challenges.
In July, Green said he was confident the signature requirement could be met under the new law because his organization had statewide support.
In 2018, 57% of voters approved legalizing medical marijuana.
But less than five years later, they defeated a proposed state statute change to legalize recreational marijuana. The vote was nearly 62% against State Question 820.

Property Tax Deadline Extension and $400 Million Budget Shortfall Top Legislative Agenda
By Brent Budge, Contributing Journalist
The Delaware General Assembly is preparing for back-to-back special sessions in November as the state faces significant fiscal hurdles caused by Property Tax and Budget challenges. On November 6, the Senate will convene to consider revising the property tax due date—currently set for November 30—due to delays in issuing revised tax bills. These delays stemmed from recent legal proceedings in the Delaware Court of Chancery, which ruled on October 30 on the constitutionality of the “split-rate” taxation system adopted during an earlier Special Session on August 12. Lawmakers are expected to debate postponing the tax deadline, with December 31 under consideration as the new date.
Just a week later, on November 13, the General Assembly will reconvene at the request of Governor Matt Meyer to address a newly identified $400 million budget shortfall projected over the next three years. This gap was highlighted in the latest Delaware Economic and Financial Advisory Council (DEFAC) revenue forecasts and is attributed to a combination of changes in federal tax law—nicknamed “The Big, Beautiful Bill”—and the state’s spending patterns in recent years.
State officials note that Delaware’s spending increases have dramatically outpaced revenue growth in the past three years. While the state budget has grown by 29%, overall inflation during the same period was just 9%. The upcoming sessions are expected to spark important debates on fiscal responsibility and the future direction of state finances.
Of particular concern is the impact of the depreciation provision in the “Big Beautiful Bill.”  Under this provision, businesses could again “expense” large R&D expenditures in the year those purchases were made, instead of depreciating them over the course of several years.  This “bonus” depreciation reduces the current tax liability for businesses and creates an incentive for R&D investment to improve the business and create higher, future revenues (and taxes).  Businesses will also be able to go back retroactively to the last three tax years to claim those deductions.  Governor Meyer is concerned that, as Delaware’s tax laws mirror federal law, this will reduce the current revenue for the state of Delaware.  He has proposed “de-coupling” the Delaware and federal tax code in some ways to avoid this impact.  Several other Northeastern states have made similar decoupling moves, although none have decoupled from this R&D provision.  In fact, 10 states had actually extended this benefit during the 3 years that it had waned.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FB_IMG_1631792563094-002.jpg,,,2025-11-05 16:57:17.676933

Patrick Morrisey speaks about West Virginia’s application to the federal Rural Health Transformation Fund program during a news conference Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2025 in Charleston, West Virginia. (Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)West Virginia has officially submitted its application for the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Fund program, Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced Wednesday.
West Virginia is eligible for more that $100 million per year over five years from the federal program, which aims to “transform the existing rural health care infrastructure and build sustainable health care systems that expand access, enhance quality of care, and improve outcomes for patients,” according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
“This represents a very exciting new chapter for West Virginia in our efforts to really strengthen the health and well being for all West Virginians, and to use that as leverage to grow our economy in a way never seen before,” Morrisey said. “This is a unique opportunity and something we’re going to be doing right.”  
The program is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Wednesday was the deadline for states to apply for the funding. 
The state’s complete application was not available Wednesday, but Morrisey said the state intends to publish it. According to a summary of the application, the state would use the money to tackle the health barriers that hurt the state’s workforce participation rate, which has been one of the lowest in the country. In August, 54.3% of the state’s residents were working or actively seeking a job in August, according to Workforce West Virginia. 
“West Virginia is going to confront the barriers directly that keep West Virginians out of the workforce,” Morrisey said. “I’ve mentioned it before. I’ll mention again, poor health is the single largest driver of low labor force participation. We have one of the highest disability incident rates in America. We have to address that, and that’s why improving health care outcomes must be a primary focus. By investing in prevention, the state’s going to restore some of its working age population to health and more productivity.”
The state aims to make West Virginia a “national hub” for rural health innovation and modernize care delivery and payment systems, according to the application summary. 
The state’s plan includes seven focus areas. They include:

Building infrastructure to bring virtual and in-person care access to people on-demand
Transporting residents to care when needed
Recruiting, training and retaining health care workers in the state 
Supporting tech-enabled innovation and regulatory relief
Helping West Virginians rebuild health, rejoin the workforce and thrive in their communities
Empowering healthy living through food as medicine, movement, and local partnerships

More information about the application is available on the governor’s website. 
Overall, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is expected to cut the federal Medicaid program by nearly $911 billion over 10 years and result in 10 million people losing health insurance by 2034, according to the nonpartisan health policy research organization KFF.  
West Virginia hospitals are expected to lose about $1 billion per year in Medicaid funding when the legislation is fully implemented. Congress added the rural health fund to address concerns of hospitals closing as a result of the funding loss, but very little of the $100 million per year in federal funding would go toward rural hospitals. 
Morrisey on Wednesday said there’s a lot that’s speculative about the projections. By investing upfront, the state can save money, he said. 
“That’s the goal behind it,” he said. “I think that’s President [Donald] Trump’s vision. That’s my vision behind this. That’s what we’re working to do. So I don’t think the future is preordained based upon what some experts have come up with. When we’re the ones putting the application together, we’re the ones who are building this infrastructure, and I think it could be very helpful.” 
According to the governor’s office, West Virginia’s application was developed with public input and “broad stakeholder engagement” that included roundtable discussions and a statewide tele-townhall with more than 17,000 participants. Curtis Capehart, Morrisey’s director of policy, told lawmakers last month the office had received approximately 2,000 pages of input from more than 221 citizens and organizations. 
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, previously said it plans to announce state awards from the Rural Health Transformation Program by Dec. 31. 
A spokesperson for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told West Virginia Watch Wednesday that despite the ongoing federal government shutdown, “CMS remains on track to announce the awards by Dec. 31.”

The so-called “big, beautiful bill” that congressional Republicans approved in July included a total of $50 billion for the Rural Health Transformation Program. The money is meant to offset some of the expected damage to rural hospitals from the law’s steep cuts to Medicaid.
In Washington’s rural areas, federal spending from Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, is set to drop over $4 billion in the next decade, according to an analysis by nonpartisan health research group KFF. Over one million Washingtonians live in rural communities.
Adults in non-metro counties in Washington have higher rates of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, according to the state’s application for the federal funding filed Monday and made public Wednesday.
Half of the $50 billion will be evenly distributed to all states with approved applications for funding. 
The other half of the money will be doled out based on states’ number of rural residents and health facilities, and how well aligned each state is with the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy Again” policies, among other criteria. These policies include reestablishing the Presidential Fitness Test and restricting how federal food stamp benefits can be spent. 
Washington’s ask for a total of $1 billion over the next five years includes $302 million for hospital infrastructure, Gov. Bob Ferguson noted in a letter to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz.
The state is unlikely to receive that full funding given “the way the application scoring process works,” Evan Klein, of the state Health Care Authority, told lawmakers Wednesday.
Other objectives include investing in new technologies, strengthening the rural health workforce, improving health care in tribal communities, building more community-based care and expanding the rural behavioral health system. 
“Rural Washington boasts strong communities, robust agriculture, and some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world,” wrote Ferguson, a Democrat. “In order to sustain this way of life, we must support a strong rural health care system.”
Ferguson notes the plan has bipartisan support from state legislative leaders.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has made clear the money should go toward developing long-term solutions for rural health care, not just temporary cash infusions for struggling hospitals. 
How Washington would use the money
Washington lists a half-dozen overarching goals for the money it’s seeking.
One is to enable rural hospitals to invest in new technology and sustain maternal, obstetrics and other services. The state hopes the money will ensure no more rural hospitals close their obstetrics units. Twenty-five rural hospitals in Washington don’t have labor and delivery units. 
Another is to use about $25 million per year to build programs to provide care in community-based settings, expand dementia resources, and add long-term care training. Just one in five long-term care workers in Washington serve rural counties, according to the state’s application.
The third objective is to set aside money for investing in improved health outcomes for tribal communities, including through community workforce development. 
In his letter, Ferguson said this issue came up at the Centennial Accords meeting in October, with tribal leaders specifically mentioning maternal care as a key need. Ten percent of the rural health funding would be earmarked for tribes and Indian Health Care Providers, Ferguson wrote.
The state also wants to provide funding for emerging and proven technologies, including artificial intelligence, that could improve remote health care services, among other goals. In a survey this year from the Washington State Hospital Association, over 80% of rural providers reported not having enough money to invest in technology upgrades.
About $4 million per year would help expand Project ECHO at the University of Washington, a mentorship initiative for clinicians in underserved communities. 
In addition, the state wants to strengthen the rural health workforce, especially the ranks of nurses, primary care doctors, maternity care providers, dental hygienists and long-term care workers. Some funding would go to Washington State University’s rural practitioner training programs, for example.
Among the 157 family medicine residents across Washington who graduated last year, fewer than one in 10 are practicing in rural communities, according to the application.
Another goal is expanding services to treat addiction and mental health issues through workforce development, as well as increasing mobile crisis support and school-based services.
A study this year found Washington’s rural communities face waits for many mental health services, and demand for mobile crisis services exceeds capacity. Drug overdose rates in rural Washington are higher than the statewide average. 
The state received over 300 comments from stakeholders to guide its application.
In September, U.S. Reps. Dan Newhouse, R-Sunnyside, and Michael Baumgartner, R-Spokane, along with other Republicans from Democratic-led states, urged federal health officials to ensure the new funding goes to rural providers, instead of being diverted to urban areas.
The Trump administration is expected to announce awards by the end of the year. The deadline for states’ applications was Wednesday. The agency will distribute $10 billion each year for the next five years. Changes to how much each state receives can be made each year.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hospital-room--1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-05 16:57:17.676933

The Department of Environmental Quality tested water in the prison’s Food Factory and the high-security and low-security dining rooms, said the release, sent Tuesday. It said those tests came back clear.
A boil water order at the prison was lifted last week. Water tests at the prison are performed frequently, testing for coliform and E. coli. 
“This outcome is the result of a tremendous group effort, and we are thankful to everyone who played a role in helping us continue operations throughout this challenging situation,” DOC Director Brian Gootkin said in the press release. “We have water service in all areas, which means we can focus our attention on getting as far along the path of replacing the existing water system as possible over the coming months.”
On Oct. 10, the prison lost water, which then had to be trucked in. Water bottles were also given to inmates during the crisis. Several leaks were eventually found, and the state moved forward the timeline on a $21 million plan to fix the water infrastructure at the prison, which augments a larger renovation already underway.
That work is ongoing. Water service was restored late last month.
“Crews will begin installing additional incoming and outgoing flow meters and replacing new supply line to the water tanks,” the press release said. “Contractors are also mapping plans for water system replacement.

Ken Albers said during the board’s meeting at the Jameson Annex of the South Dakota State Penitentiary that he would not be able to return for the December meeting. He later told South Dakota Searchlight that he’s leaving for personal reasons.
The board can grant early release to state prison inmates. Its nine members also serve as a screening panel for pardons, which clear an old crime or crimes from a person’s public record, and commutations, which reduce the sentence of current inmates. The board can recommend clemency in either of those situations, but under the state constitution only the governor can grant it. 
Three of the board’s members are appointed by the governor, three by the attorney general and three by the state Supreme Court. Each of the three appointing offices is required to choose at least one attorney. Members are confirmed by the state Senate.
Albers, a former Lincoln County sheriff and former state lawmaker, was appointed by Gov. Dennis Daugaard and has since been reappointed three times. He’s served a total of 15 years, according to the Department of Corrections.
Gov. Larry Rhoden is empowered to appoint an interim parole board member for Albers, and can nominate an official replacement with a letter to the state Senate.

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The mayor of a small south-central Kansas town has been charged with committing fraud by voting in elections since 2022 even though he is not a United States citizen, the state’s attorney general and secretary of state said Wednesday.
Attorney General Kris Kobach said Joe Ceballos, who garnered nearly 83% of the vote Tuesday for a second term as Coldwater mayor, was charged with three counts of voting without being qualified and three counts of election perjury. Both are felony offenses.
“These charges carry a potential maximum penalty of up to 68 months imprisonment and up to $200,000 in fines,” Kobach said. 
The charges, filed in Comanche County, are based on Ceballos’ voting in the 2022 general election, the 2023 general election for local offices and the 2024 primary election, Kobach said. 
Ceballos served two terms on the Coldwater City Council and was elected mayor in 2021, a position he is not qualified to hold if he is not a U.S. citizen although it is not a criminal violation, Kobach said. 
He referenced a Kansas statute that requires a city officer to be a qualified elector, which requires that person to be a United States citizen. 
“He is a legal permanent resident of the United States and a citizen of Mexico,” Kobach said. 
Schwab said it would be up to the local governing board to make a determination about the mayoral race after the election is finalized. 
Coldwater government leaders did not find out about the situation until Wednesday. 
“The Coldwater City Council were called in for a special meeting by Mayor Joe Ceballos November 5th, 2025 at 1240 pm to discuss recent events that have transpired with the Kansas attorney general’s Office,” said city council president Britt Lenertz in a statement.
Lenertz said the city council is currently focused on ensuring smooth operations in the city amid the controversy. 
“While the recent allegations involving the mayor are understandably concerning, we will allow the proper legal process to take its course before making any further comments,” she said. “It’s important that we respect both due process and the integrity of our local government.”
Lenertz said in a telephone interview that the city is unsure what, if any, implications it would have for city business if it is determined Ceballos has not been eligible to hold office. She said the city is reaching out for guidance on the issue. 
During a news conference in Topeka, Kobach and Secretary of State Scott Schwab said the state is actively pursuing cases like this by using the federal Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, database, which can be queried by states to determine a voter’s U.S. citizenship status.
According to The Center Square, 26 states are using the database to verify voter registration information. Schwab confirmed Kansas has begun using the SAVE database to check voter registrations, but also said the case against Ceballos was not compiled using the database. 
Kobach has waged a campaign for years claiming significant voter fraud and pushing for  stricter voting regulations, including proof of citizenship laws and showing photo identification at the polls.
Schwab, who is the state’s top elections officer, said until Kansas began recently using the SAVE database, he had disagreed with Kobach that there was much of an issue. 
“We’re currently verifying. We don’t want any false positives, but attorney general, be prepared to be busy as we go through these and find out potential positives of people who are non-U.S. citizens that have voted,” Schwab said. “I was never really a big believer this happened. I always came from the angle of, let’s prove it’s not happening, and then we get the data, and it’s important we clean this up.”
Kobach said he expects there will be hundreds of people on the voter rolls who are not legally eligible to vote. Although that may be a small number compared to the 2 million registered to vote in Kansas, it matters, he said. 
The argument that illegal votes are a small percentage of total votes cast is a “red herring,” because in close races even a small number of votes can make a difference, Kobach said. 
“I would argue that even when it doesn’t affect an outcome, it still effectively takes the vote away or cancels the vote of a U.S. citizen,” he said.
Schwab said he believes elections in Kansas are secure. 
“Overwhelmingly, our elections are secure, but I’ve said it for seven years. We look at election security sort of like we look at cyber security.

(Getty Images)Two years ago, when “L.M.,” a 12-year-old at the John T. Nichols Middle School in Middleborough, Mass., showed up to school with a shirt stating “There Are Only Two Genders,” administrators quickly took action.
L.M. was sent to the principal’s office and asked to remove the shirt. Teachers and school officials worried about his physical safety, the disruptive effect the shirt could have, and the potential that the shirt could be harmful to LGBTQ+ students. In disagreement, L.M.’s father took his son home for the day. Two months later, L.M. brought a lawsuit arguing his First Amendment rights had been violated. 
The lawsuit, L.M. v. Town of Middleborough, led to a decision last year by the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in which the shirt was determined to “materially disrupt” learning, and in which the school’s decision was upheld.
This year, that same Boston court has taken up a New Hampshire lawsuit that touches on a similar cultural debate. Lawyers for the Bow School District are hoping it will come to a similar conclusion. 
On Wednesday, the 1st Circuit Court heard oral arguments in a lawsuit brought by parents who showed up to a Bow soccer game in 2024 wearing armbands in support of barring transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports. 
But details in the Bow case differ from the Middleborough case, and the three-judge panel expressed some skepticism of the school district’s position Wednesday. 
The Bow parents claim district officials violated their free speech rights by demanding they remove the armbands. The districts counter that the armbands were implicitly directed at a transgender high school player on the field, and that the school’s actions fall into First Amendment exceptions.
The dispute arose when a number of parents began wearing pink armbands with the letters “XX” in black — a representation of biologically female chromosomes — during a game in which the Bow’s girls’ soccer team faced off against a Plymouth team that had a transgender female student. Bow officials asked the parents to remove the wristbands and briefly paused the game. Citing school policy violations, Superintendent Marcy Kelley issued “no trespass” orders to two of the parents. The orders have since expired.
U.S. District Court Judge Steven McAuliffe ruled against the parents’ request for an injunction against the school district in April, and the parents have appealed. 
A push for viewpoint neutrality
At the heart of the arguments Wednesday is a disagreement over what counts as viewpoint discrimination.
Attorneys for the parents argued the school discriminated against parents on the basis of viewpoint by singling out their position against transgender sports participation as a violation, when the same school would not prohibit a pro-transgender message.
In effect, the district decided to allow inclusionary viewpoints around LGBTQ+ students but disallow exclusionary viewpoints, plaintiffs said. That kind of selectiveness is prohibited by the First Amendment, argued Endel Kolde of the Institute for Free Speech, which is bringing the lawsuit.
“If progressive parents chose to wear a pride flag or a trans progress pride flag … I wouldn’t have a problem with that. I would be happy to represent those people if they were censored,” Kolde said. 
Some of the judges challenged the limits of that interpretation. 
Responding to a question from Judge Sandra Lynch, Kolde said the same free speech protections would apply to a student who came to school with a Ku Klux Klan shirt, provided that the school district also allowed “Black Lives Matter” shirts to be worn. But he stressed that he was not equating a KKK symbol with the XX symbol, and noted there are strong cultural mores against support for the KKK. In contrast, opposition to “XX” bands is not universal, he added. 
Kolde sought to narrow his free speech argument to quiet protests. The plaintiffs are not trying to prevent school districts from taking action against any disruptions, he said. “We are not asking to chant, not asking to talk to players. We’re not asking to hold debates on the sidelines or anything like that.” 
Should there be a major protest at a game that is audibly distracting players and interfering with the game, the school would be justified in shutting it down, Kolde said. But he said that justification doesn’t apply to the encounter in Bow, because the wristbands were silent. And he argued that the school district caused the disruption to the game, not the parents, and that no disruption might have occurred without that action.
“No one was bothered by it in the audience; none of the players complained,” he argued. “There’s not even evidence that any of the players even saw the XX wristbands in this case.”
Opposing exclusionary language
Arguing for the defendants — who include Kelley, Bow High School Athletic Director Michael Desilets, and Bow High School Principal Matt Fisk — Jonathan Shirley of Cullen Collimore Shirley PLLC in Nashua said the enforcement was justified.
The school’s prohibition on the wristbands was viewpoint neutral because officials were following a consistent policy, Shirley said: to not allow people to speak against a student’s right to play in a sports game.
Displaying material that argues against a student’s participation changes the speech from a mere opinion to harassment, he argued.
“That player should not have to confront this protest that says, ‘You know what, you shouldn’t be there,’” he said. 
Some judges Tuesday expressed skepticism about the school policy Shirley was outlining that would allow action against speech that targets a player’s right to play. 
“Wouldn’t it be viewpoint discriminatory to have to permit a message saying you should be there but not a message that you can’t be there?” asked Judge Julie Rikelman. 
Shirley said speech directed against a student is not the same as speech expressing a different viewpoint. 
He added that the school district had a reasonable expectation that the demonstration by parents would turn disruptive and hurtful to transgender students, pointing to emails that some of the parents had sent to school officials ahead of the game objecting to the decision to let the transgender student play. 
“Our clients had a reasonable apprehension that much more was planned, and that if they didn’t intervene that it was going to get out of hand,” he said.
The wristbands communicated that potentially hurtful message, Shirley argued, and the district was obligated to remove them in order to protect transgender students’ rights as required under the Title IX federal law.
And he asked the court to apply the same approach it did in the Middleborough case, in which it found that school districts are allowed to act if they reasonably forecast that a student’s shirt will be disruptive to the educational atmosphere.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs have said the Middleborough precedent doesn’t apply to the Bow case, noting that the Middleborough case dealt with speech rights of students, which are less robust than those of parents. 
Slippery slope vs. ‘impossible position’
The soccer game incident came after the passage of House Bill 1205 in 2024, which effectively barred transgender girls from playing on girls’ sports teams from grades 5-12. That law was temporarily blocked by U.S. District Court Judge Landya McCafferty that same year after two transgender athletes argued it was unconstitutionally discriminatory. 
The game at the center of the parents’ lawsuit came days after McCafferty’s injunction. One of the athletes that had sued to block the law, Parker Tirrell, played for the Plymouth soccer team, which was facing Bow. That situation prompted a call by some parents to demonstrate against the decision. 
On Wednesday, Kolde argued that a ruling by the circuit court against the parents would create a precedent that could allow a school district to selectively censor any political speech on the grounds that a student might feel hurt by it.
“People are just going to complain and say ‘I feel harassed by that message’ when they disagree with the message, when they don’t want it to be heard, and it will lead to much more censorship in the First Circuit,” he said.
But Shirley said the opposite ruling could put school districts in a “seemingly impossible position” — unable to prevent speech that could cause harm to students until the harm is actively underway. 
“In the telling of the appellants, the school is supposed to just wait,” he said. “Wait until that becomes pervasive enough that it becomes a legal claim that they now have to resolve with that student because they didn’t do their job.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/transflagscircuitcourt-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-05 16:57:17.676933

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)NEWTON — Health care providers told Democratic gubernatorial candidate Rob Sand on Wednesday that issues like Iowa’s privatized Medicaid system and restrictions on abortion are furthering problems in delivering and accessing health care in rural areas.
Sand’s campaign hosted a roundtable on rural health care in Newton with eight individuals from Iowa’s health care system throughout the state who spoke about the problems they face in fields like mental and maternal health care in rural Iowa.
Concerns about future access to health care outside of metropolitan areas have risen in recent months as Republicans in Congress passed the “One Big Beautiful” budget reconciliation bill that contained an estimated cut of more than $1 trillion from Medicaid.
In Newton, protesters and advocates have said the Newton Clinic and MercyOne Newton Medical Center could be at risk of closure due to the Medicaid cuts included in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” signed into law in July.
These concerns come as many rural Iowa health care providers have already had to close their doors or decrease services due to financial constraints. The Newton hospital paused all labor and delivery services in 2024. Dr. Abby Flannagan, an OB-GYN at UnityPoint Health in Grinnell, said at the roundtable the Grinnell hospital is now the only location many pregnant Iowans can go to to deliver their baby.
Flannagan said when she began at the Grinnell hospital over three years ago, her unit was delivering roughly 120 children each year, but that this year, her team will deliver 360 babies.
“And that’s still only three of us doing it,” Flannagan said. “So that’s the problem, is it’s we keep getting busier and busier and busier, and we’re asking (but) the help is just simply not there.”
Providers call for expansion of medical residencies, student loan forgiveness programs
Participants in the roundtable said one important step in addressing rural health care shortages — especially in maternal health care — was to increase residency slots. Flannagan said there are people going to school in Iowa or willing to move to receive training on obstetrics and gynecology care in the state, but said changes are needed to the state’s medical residency and loan forgiveness systems to support these medical professionals.
“It’s not that we don’t have people that don’t want to do this job, because there (are), it’s we don’t have residency spots, we don’t have anybody to train them, we don’t have any way to pay for it,” Flannagan said.
Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law a measure earlier in 2025 that directed the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services to work to draw down $150 million in federal funding that would go toward creating a projected 115 new residency slots at Iowa teaching hospitals.
Sand did not comment directly on the 2025 law on expanding medical residencies, but said he would support changes like allowing people who move to Iowa to participate in loan forgiveness programs even if they did not sign up to participate in these programs while in medical school.
Six-week abortion ban impacts maternal health care access, roundtable participants say
The state’s six-week abortion ban was also brought up as a factor that makes providing maternal health care more difficult in Iowa. Aastha Chandra, a current medical student at the University of Iowa, said state lawmakers passing measures like the abortion ban and other laws restricting reproductive health care have caused some of her peers to reconsider continuing their education in Iowa, or choosing to practice in the state.
Chandra said a lot of Iowa medical students would be happy to stay here. “It’s great what we have here for a program at Iowa. Just, parts of our training just can’t happen anymore because of state law,” she said. “And that’s why so many people won’t train in states like Iowa with very restrictive abortion bans — because that’s part of our training, is to provide abortion care.”
Karin Mills, a mental health provider in Newton specializing in postpartum mental health, said many of her patients have post-traumatic stress disorder or related mental health struggles in part caused by difficulties they face during labor. If health care providers are not able to perform early intervention or make certain decisions when facing a pregnancy with complications, the result could mean unneeded trauma for the parent and child — or could lead to injury or death.
Mills shared her own experience with pregnancy, saying she believed “I would be dead” if she had been pregnant under Iowa’s abortion law. She said she was expecting twins when her doctor told her she was at severe risk of a stroke unless she delivered her babies early. She said she did not want to move forward with the process because the likelihood of survival for one of her twins was low.
After discussing the issue with her husband and doctor, she chose to go through with early delivery. One of the twins died after six days of care, while her daughter survived. “I can’t imagine having to have made that decision with the government telling you what to do,” Mills said.
She said this care could have been delayed if an abortion ban was in place, potentially putting her at higher risk of a stroke, and endangering the lives of both of her children and herself.
“Just think about the long-term fallout if I had a stroke – I wouldn’t be doing this job (as a mental health counselor),” Mills said. “… That time in (the) workforce and in my daughter’s life — and all the amazing things I’m sure she’s going to do in her life, odds are she would not be here. But that again, that blows my mind, to make a decision like that … forcing someone to continue to be pregnant, knowing that it’s harming all of the above.”
Sand also said other laws passed by Republicans in Iowa — like measures related to LGBTQ+ individuals — are also having an impact on the state’s health care system. He said speaking with Flannagan at the event helped him reflect on the importance of making sure Iowa is a “welcoming state,” and encourage more people like Flannagan and her wife to choose to practice medicine in Iowa.
“I think at the end of the day, the vast majority of Iowans want someone there to deliver their babies,” Sand said. “We were talking here to a female doctor who talked about her wife. And so, who do we want to have in Iowa? My answer is everybody. Because at the end of the day, if we only have three doctors between Iowa City and Des Moines on the east and west, and Waterloo and Pella on the north and south, I think our priority is having people there to deliver babies — which is part of the reason why I think it’s important we not just talk about being a welcoming Iowa, but actually quit with the culture wars and just be focused on actually solving real problems for people.”

Special elections could decide her finishes out her term.,"Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill cannot keep her seat in Congress and be governor. Special elections could decide her finishes out her term. (Amanda Brown for New Jersey Monitor)Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill’s victory will trigger another election, this time to fill her seat in the House until a replacement can be elected to a full term next year.
Though New Jersey law and the U.S. Constitution allow New Jersey governors to make appointments to vacant Senate seats, the Constitution requires empty House seats to be filled by an election, if they are filled at all.
The New Jersey statutes that govern how House vacancies are filled are varied, and timing decides which is used.
Mikie Sherrill celebrates win in NJ governor’s race, as supporters cheer: ‘Blue is back!’

It’s not clear when Sherrill will resign from her seat in the House (she was reelected to it in November 2024 and it expires on Jan. 3, 2027). The congresswoman did not say when she would step down when asked during a press conference Wednesday. She becomes governor on Jan. 20.
“We’ll be working with the leadership in the House as well as our Legislature here to, as smoothly as possible, run the special election to get a new person that seat,” she said.
The governor could issue a writ of election declaring that voters will choose who fills out the rest of Sherrill’s current term during next year’s November general election, with nominees chosen in June primaries. That timeline would leave the 11th Congressional District’s seat vacant for about a year.
The district includes towns in Essex, Morris, and Passaic counties. Sherrill was first elected to represent it in 2018.
The governor could also call for special elections — with both a primary and a general election — to fill the seat, as Gov. Phil Murphy did following Rep. Donald Payne Jr.’s death last year. Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10) won a July 2024 primary and a September 2025 election to finish out Payne’s term.
State law sets no timeline for the governor to issue a writ of election, though it cannot be issued until the vacancy comes into being. The law sets timelines for special elections called as a result of a House vacancy, though the flexibility granted to governors on the timing of writs of election extends to those races.
Special House primaries must be held between 70 and 76 days after the issuance of the writ, with special general elections following 64 to 70 days later.
Pending legislation could upend those timelines. A bill introduced by Sen. Andrew Zwicker (D-Middlesex) would require House vacancies to be filled by a special election, including primaries, held 74 to 80 days after a vacancy occurs in most cases, eliminating the need for a governor to issue a writ of election.
Murphy indicated Wednesday that he backs changes to the process, noting that Payne and Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. died in office last year and left Democratic officials scrambling to replace them. New Jersey’s system of filling House vacancies is one of the most difficult in the nation, he said.
“We’ve got a really cumbersome process right now and that needs to be addressed,” he said.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Providence Public School District (PPSD) can now move past a federal class action lawsuit over the delivery of special education services for hundreds of preschoolers after being deemed compliant with the terms of a settlement reached two years ago.
An independent monitor has determined that school officials met all the conditions spelled out in an August 2023 settlement, according to an announcement Wednesday morning by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Rhode Island and the Rhode Island Center for Justice. The settlement was reached in a lawsuit filed in July 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
The plaintiffs, Parents Leading for Educational Equity (PLEE) and three children and their parents, claimed that Providence schools and the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) neglected to provide hundreds of children between ages 3 and 5 with the necessary accommodations for learning disabilities. 
“Based on the work of RIDE and Providence Schools special educators, children are now getting the timely services the law requires,” Jennifer Wood, executive director of the Rhode Island Center for Justice, which was part of the plaintiffs’ legal team, said in a statement Wednesday. 
The plaintiffs’ arguments were rooted in the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which mandates that students must be provided a “free appropriate public education” beginning on their third birthday. 
Under federal law, children with disabilities under age 3 are also entitled to early intervention services to better prepare them for pre-K. 
“That law always envisioned children moving seamlessly from early intervention into pre-school without a damaging interruption of services and support,” Wood added. “Children in Providence who are identified as needing extra support before the age of three are no longer falling into that gap of delayed evaluation and services.” 
Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green said the state agency was also “pleased the progress we have made has led to the successful conclusion of court monitoring.”
“With RIDE’s support, Providence Public Schools has expanded its evaluation capacity, improved placement timelines, and ensured that families have timely access to the services their children need,” Infante-Green said. “These meaningful improvements have strengthened and streamlined critical support for students and families.”
Providence Superintendent Javier Montañez said in a statement issued alongside Infante-Green’s that, with RIDE’s help, the district was “able to grow our Pre-K department and improve our pre-kindergarten evaluation systems to ensure that all Providence students have access to a quality early childhood education.” 
The plaintiffs’ legal team argued that the district regularly missed required evaluations or evaluated children too slowly, and did not place students in special education programs, also known as Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), in a timely fashion.
“The successful closure of this lawsuit marks years of dedication from families and advocates who refused to accept a system that denied young children the services they deserve and are legally entitled to,” Ramona Santos Torres, the executive director of Parents Leading for Educational Equity, said in a statement Wednesday. 
The August 2023 settlement mandated that city and state education officials evaluate children in a timely way, and place them promptly in IEPs as needed. The district was also asked to add personnel to conduct this work. Parents could also opt to enlist outside evaluators and charge the costs to the district. 
An external monitor, Thru Consulting LLC, was hired to track deadlines and file reports on the district and RIDE’s monthly progress. Those reports included data on students who were overdue for evaluations, with no more than 10 overdue students allowed at once.
Providence schools also had to clear the backlog of students who had not been evaluated, and needed to have at least three full-time preschool evaluation teams by Sept. 20, 2023, plus at least one team of part-timers with weekday evening and Saturday availability. Contracts with outside evaluators were required by Aug. 25, 2023. 
Parents whose children did not receive an evaluation by Sept. 15, 2023, were informed they could go to an outside evaluator at the district’s expense. The district had to pay these evaluators at regional rates, and waive out-of-state licensing barriers if needed.
The district was initially expected to close the settlement and satisfy its terms by July 1. That didn’t happen, so the court extended oversight to Nov. 1, the ACLU press release said, the monitor’s most recent report last month found “substantial compliance,” so the suit can close.  
“We will continue to monitor this issue, as it is important that the compliance continue,” Ellen Saideman, an ACLU of RI cooperating attorney, said in a statement.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-05 21:02:24+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,DTA: Some food aid recipients will see benefits drop to ‘zero’,Ella Adams | State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/government/dta-some-food-aid-recipients-will-see-benefits-drop-to-zero/,"""I'm trying to do the best I can to manage the situation,"" Healey said. She added, ""No state can come forward and replace what the federal government has taken away.""","IT’S NOT JUST money to buy food that’s at risk now due to the historically long federal government shutdown, Gov. Maura Healey said Wednesday, while maintaining that the state isn’t able to use its own substantial reserve fund to plug growing gaps in safety net programs.
Home heating assistance via the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), child care programs and nutrition benefits aside from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) like the Women, Infants and Children Nutrition Program (WIC) have also run out of funding or are at risk of it, Healey said.
“A million residents in Massachusetts denied SNAP. Another 300,000 in Massachusetts denied heating assistance funding right now from the federal government. A separate ‘nother 300,000 Massachusetts residents who received notices that their health care premiums are going to go up through the roof, in some instances, increasing by as much as $20,000,” Healey said during an appearance on “Boston Public Radio.” 
Healey also referred to federal workers in Massachusetts who are not receiving pay during the shutdown and are filing for unemployment. 
A federal court last week ordered the Trump administration to pay partial SNAP benefits. The United States Department of Agriculture on Nov. 4 sent guidance to states delineating that “partial” means the maximum benefit households are able to receive is 50 percent of their traditional benefits. 
According to an update on the Department of Transitional Assistance’s website, the agency estimates that it will take “approximately” one week for DTA and the EBT vendor to make “systems changes” to send November SNAP benefits to cards. The agency’s site says it expects to be able to issue partial benefits “sometime during the week of November 10.”
“The amount of SNAP benefits a household will get depends on household circumstances like household members, income, and expenses. Households with income will see the greatest reduction in their November SNAP benefits,” according to DTA. “This will greatly reduce the amount of SNAP benefits that people will get, and will bring tens of thousands of SNAP clients benefits to zero.”
Healey said Wednesday morning that she did not know when November Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits would be available.
Some advocates have urged the state to tap its $8 billion rainy day fund to fund food assistance, a step that Democrats who run Beacon Hill have resisted so far. Asked why she hasn’t done so, Healey said, “To be clear, I want to do everything that I can to support these families and those who need food.” 
“SNAP benefits are about two $220 million a month coming into Massachusetts. We cannot begin to make that up. I just laid out, you know, the other things that are coming — SNAP ran out last week, Saturday. LIHEAP ran out Saturday. WIC runs out in another week,” Healey said. “Head Start — I had to advance money the other day to Head Start in order to keep 2,000 little kids in child care.”
The Healey administration last week said that it will use $13 million in home heating assistance funding remaining from last year to help households “in the short term while the shutdown continues.”
“I’m trying to do the best I can to manage the situation,” Healey said. She added, “No state can come forward and replace what the federal government has taken away.”
House Ways and Means Chair Aaron Michlewitz on Friday sent a letter to credit rating agencies to ask how pulling from the rainy day fund, with the expectation that the state may not receive a federal reimbursement, would impact the state’s credit rating. Asked about the letter and whether he was more open to tapping into the fund eight years after the state received a bond rating downgrade for pulling from it, House Speaker Ron Mariano on Tuesday called the situation “unprecedented times.”
“We don’t know how long this federal government is going to be shut down,” Mariano said. “So we’re concerned about drawing down anything from the rainy day fund, we wanted to be perfectly clear where the parameters were and what we are able to do to make sure our constituents can meet the challenges that are being faced by the federal shutdown.”
Senate Republicans last week suggested the state use regular appropriations to backfill assistance, drawing comparisons to the substantial amount of aid provided by the state during the emergency family shelter crisis. 
In response to a News Service inquiry about how much federal funding the state anticipates will be made available for SNAP, Healey’s office said that “DTA is currently assessing the cost of these new reduced benefits. From our initial review, we expect the total amount to be less than half of what we usually receive, since many recipients will see larger than 50 percent reductions or will receive no benefits at all.”
Healey did not respond directly Wednesday when asked when DTA will complete its review, but said that “we’re ready to go as a state when that money comes forward” and called the USDA guidance “intentionally convoluted so that states couldn’t even implement it.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Gov.-Maura-Healey-speaks-to-press-in-her-office-at-the-State-House-on-Wednesday-Oct.-8-2025.webp?fit=990%2C660&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-05 16:02:37.904254

For many in the audience, the vote felt like a moment years in the making. Dozens of residents, organizers and families filled City Hall chambers, many wearing shirts and holding signs from Make the Road Connecticut (MRCT), a statewide immigrant rights organization that led months of advocacy around the measure. When the resolution passed, applause erupted, followed by hugs, tears, and chants in Spanish.
“This is a big win,” said Sonia Hernandez, an organizer with MRCT and an undocumented immigrant from Honduras who has lived in Bridgeport for more than a decade. “We cannot wait for ICE to attack us and separate more families. Our kids should focus on their studies, not be afraid that they might not find their parents when they return from school.”
Introduced by Councilman Jorge Cruz Jr., with co-sponsors Denese Taylor-Moye and Alfredo Castillo, the resolution affirms Bridgeport’s commitment to protecting immigrant families and calls for greater transparency in how federal immigration enforcement operates in the city.
The measure urges federal agencies to limit enforcement actions to serious public safety threats and to end ICE raids in public spaces such as schools, churches and community areas. It also calls for public reporting on ICE requests and prohibits local officials from participating in civil immigration enforcement.
Hernandez said the resolution sends a clear message to the city’s immigrant population. 
“Our community is in fear, and kids are being traumatized. People are becoming emotionally depressed. If you say Bridgeport is a welcoming city, you’re welcoming everybody, but you’re not protecting them,” she said. “We want transparency from immigration officers. Show their badges, show their warrants signed by a judge.”
She added that the passage of the resolution could inspire other Connecticut cities like Stamford and Danbury to take similar action.
Councilman Cruz said he was motivated to act after witnessing ICE operations across the country and wanted to ensure Bridgeport would not be a place where families were torn apart.
“I didn’t want to feel helpless watching ICE agents going around targeting Black and brown people,” Cruz said. “I would say to the immigrant community, continue to stand strong. Have your eyes and ears open, but don’t live in fear. Stay connected to organizations and resources that are right here in Bridgeport.”
Cruz emphasized the importance of community support. “We love you. We want you here. We respect the law. What we don’t respect is terrorizing,” he said. He also acknowledged that one voice alone isn’t enough to create lasting change. “I’m just one voice. We need thousands of voices.”

For many immigrant residents, the resolution represents both relief and recognition. Bridgeport has one of the largest Spanish-speaking populations in Connecticut, and advocates say many undocumented residents live with daily fear — afraid to drive to work, walk their kids to school or even shop for groceries.
Daira Marin, a youth organizer and coordinator for MRCT, said the measure addresses basic dignity and everyday fear. 
“They shouldn’t be scared to go out and buy bread for their family, go to school, or even just get on the bus to go to work,” Marin said. “Change starts at a local level. Small changes are really what drive everything forward.”
Nelly Mendoza, a Bridgeport resident and member of Make the Road Connecticut, expressed relief and hope. 
“I’m so happy because we have a lot of families scared outside,” she said. “Now, I feel like we can breathe a little. This shows that when we speak up, we can make change.”
Hernandez highlighted the community effort behind the victory. “When we show up, they have to listen,” she said. “We’re not invisible. We are part of this city. We work here. We raise our families here. We deserve to feel safe here.”
Organizers said passage of the resolution is a victory not only for Bridgeport’s immigrant families but also for local advocacy groups. Make the Road Connecticut and other organizations spent months mobilizing residents to attend council meetings, make phone calls and participate in rallies.
“This is what democracy looks like,” said Marin. “People showing up, raising their voices and holding their leaders accountable.”
While the resolution does not change federal law or ICE enforcement practices directly, advocates say it establishes a clear local stance that could influence how ICE interacts with Bridgeport residents. It also provides a framework for ongoing community oversight and accountability.

“This is not just about a resolution,” Hernandez said. “It’s about dignity, respect and being seen as human. For the Spanish-speaking community in Bridgeport, this is a message that they are not alone. It tells them that their lives matter, that their children deserve to grow up without fear.”
Even with the resolution’s passage, organizers say their work is not done. MRCT plans to continue monitoring the city’s implementation and push for broader protections at the state and national levels.
“Change starts locally,” Marin said. “We can’t fix everything overnight, but this is where it begins.”
Outside City Hall, chants of “Sí, se puede!” — yes, we can — echoed through the plaza.
For Hernandez, the victory was deeply personal. “This shows what organizing can do,” she said. “Our voices mattered. And that means everything.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_8988-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-11-05 16:02:37.904254

Further consolidation risks diverting our focus from our central mission.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Meghan Metzler and Dave Connery: Recommendations to the Vermont Redistricting Task Force from the Champlain Valley School District School Board.","This commentary is by Meghan Metzler and Dave Connery, chair and vice chair of the Champlain Valley School District School Board.


As a school board, we thank the Vermont School District Redistricting Task Force for their work to support and improve education across the state. CVSD’s school board shares that vision for our community, while fostering growth and belonging for all of our students.
As we shared with the Redistricting Task Force at their recent public hearing, CVSD’s school board supports the supervisory district governance model under which we have operated since 2017. This model allows CVSD to operate at an efficient scale that positively impacts our students and community and is the primary structure we recommend the Task Force consider when modeling across Vermont.
CVSD is a supervisory district formed under Act 46, with one 12-member governing school board overseeing six schools (Champlain Valley Union High School, three pre-K-8 schools, one pre-K-2 school and one 3-8 school) across five towns.
Prior to 2017, the towns of Charlotte, Shelburne, Hinesburg, St. George and Williston formed the Chittenden South Supervisory Union, which was governed by seven different school boards. One of our towns previously offered school choice because it did not operate a school.
CVSD is the only district in Vermont that meets the minimum size requirements in Act 73 for one key reason: we consolidated eight years ago and have spent the time since doing the hard work that consolidation requires. This work has positively impacted both our students and our community in many ways.
The supervisory district structure and size of our district allow our schools to operate at scale and enables our central office to work efficiently in providing the conditions for all students, in all schools, to advance toward our shared mission and vision. Some examples include:

The superintendent reports to a single school board with one budget, and our schools follow a common curriculum framework and unified set of policies. This coherence improves student outcomes through aligned professional learning, consistent instructional practices, and equitable allocation of resources.
Our class sizes are well above the minimums outlined in Act 73. Each K–8 school currently has at least two classes per grade, which allows students to learn in dynamic environments and have a range of peers over the years. 
We oversee the entire educational experience — from pre-K or kindergarten through high school graduation — and we understand how tax dollars are spent, allowing us to reallocate resources when needs arise within our schools.

Consolidation has been beneficial for our community. It has also required significant time and effort involving the technical aspects of governance and operations, as well as deep collaboration, trust and attention to integrate communities, identities and expectations. Further consolidation risks diverting our focus from our central mission: to engage every student and continue evolving our instructional and assessment systems toward a future-ready model. 
We also recognize that, beyond a certain point, districts may begin to lose the benefits of scale. For these reasons, we have not identified any other districts that CVSD should consolidate with. 
We know there are no easy answers to the redistricting work outlined under Act 73. CVSD’s school board is committed to engaging in the process, to collaborating with our legislative representatives, and to educating our constituency along the way in order to best represent our students and community.

Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers) to abolish the Michigan Economic Development Corporation. Nov. 5, 2025 | Photo By Kyle Davidson/Michigan Advance“The experiment is over,” state Rep. Jay DeBoyer proclaimed on Wednesday as he previewed a set of bills aimed at eliminating the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, a quasi-governmental entity tasked with attracting businesses and jobs to the state. 
Alongside his co-sponsor Rep. Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers), the Clay township Republican argued the corporation had failed to deliver on its mission of nurturing a strong business environment, and that Michigan’s business environment could be better supported by lowering tax policy and cutting back on regulations rather than offering subsidies.
“We are not competitive and to believe that we can take taxpayers’ dollars, bribe companies to come here, that that is a long term solution is a fallacy, because if they will come here for a check, they will leave here for a check.” DeBoyer said. “We want entities in the state of Michigan that are committed to our state, that are committed to our people, that are comfortable here, that are not over regulated, that are not overtaxed.”
Carra pointed to several high-profile deals negotiated by the economic development corporation that had fallen through in the past year, including the rescission of state support for the Gotion electric vehicle battery plant, and Sandisk’s decision to pull out of plans to build a semiconductor plant in Genesee County – a decision Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office said was made due to “national economic turmoil.”
The Michigan Economic Development Corporation has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, as officials mull a new approach to economic development within the state. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
An investigation from Bridge Michigan earlier this year found that between 2019 and 2024, the state offered nearly $2.5 billion – including $1 billion in taxpayer funds – to companies promising to increase hiring or build facilities in Michigan. Although 65,491 jobs were promised, only 13,079 had been created.
The two Republicans proposals, slated for introduction during Wednesday’s House session, were narrowed in on two goals, Carra explained, abolishing the agency, and ensuring the Michigan Strategic Fund, which negotiates economic development programs with local governments and oversees various grant and loan programs, cannot contract with local governments for economic development.

With the state holding several multi-year grant agreements, Carra said these policies were focused on preventing future agreements, with the legislation transfering the Michigan Economic Development Corporation’s powers, duties and functions to the Michigan Strategic Fund. 
Alongside criticism of the corporation’s effectiveness, DeBoyer also pointed to the underlying mistrust toward the organization, pointing to an ongoing scandal regarding alleged misuse of grant funds, alongside reporting from the Detroit News on the state’s decision to end its contract with the chief compliance officer for the Michigan Strategic Fund, who was tasked with ensuring the board follows the law. 
During an August appearance on WDIV Local 4’s Flashpoint, Attorney General Dana Nessel suggested the state should halt funding for the agency after accusing the corporation of stonewalling her department’s investigation into alleged misuse of a $20 million Legislative grant.  
When asked what would happen to the funding for the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, which is largely derived from a percentage of the revenue generated by tribal casinos and online gambling, Carra said the state will need to look into those nuances. 
Beydoun grant scandal could lead to needed state economic development reforms

While Carra and DeBoyer accused the governor of creating an unfavorable business environment within the state, Whitmer’s office made it clear that these bills would not be crossing the finish line. 
“At a time when Michigan is landing record job creating investments, including in Rep. Carra’s district, we should keep our foot on the gas, not throw everything into reverse,” the governor’s Director of Communications Robert Leddy said in a statement, referencing a five-year tax exemption approved by the Michigan Strategic Fund in support of a $132.9 million in upgrades to American Axle’s Three Rivers campus.
With CNBC rating Michigan sixth in its “Top 10 States for Business” list earlier this year, the governor’s office argued that Carra and DeBoyer’s proposal would mark the state as closed for business while killing jobs and shuttering small businesses. 
“These bills are a waste of time, and they are dead on arrival,” Leddy said. “The governor has her veto pen ready to prevent these bills from destroying the economy.”
In a statement to the Michigan Advance, Danielle Emerson, the corporation’s public relations manager said the agency’s programs and services have trained and placed more than 5,950 workers and more than 1,480 interns in good-paying jobs over the course of the 2025 fiscal year, alongside assisting 2,000 new businesses with start up and helping small businesses secure roughly $2.77 billion in new revenue. 
Emerson also pointed to a 2019 commentary piece from the W.E. Upjohn Institute for employee research, which noted the effectiveness of the state’s Michigan Business Development program, with a 4-1 benefit-cost ratio.

U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat who has represented Maine’s 2nd Congressional District for eight years, said he will not seek reelection next year. 
The Lewiston resident who has been known for often breaking from his party published an op-ed in the Bangor Daily News Wednesday saying he will not run in 2026, citing increased “incivility and plain nastiness that are now common from some elements of our American community.”
“I have never loved politics,” he wrote. “But I find purpose and meaning in service, and the Marine in me has been able to slog along through the many aspects of politics I dislike by focusing on the good work that Congress is capable of producing with patience and determination.”
Golden also said increased political violence has made him reassess the threat to himself and his family, especially as his oldest daughter reaches school age, recalling last Thanksgiving when his family had to go to a hotel after threats were made to their home. He also specifically mentions the assassination attempt on President Donald Trump as well as the killing of Democratic Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman and conservative activist Charlie Kirk. 
Although he was facing a primary challenge from State Auditor Matt Dunlap, Golden said he knew he would prevail. Former Maine Gov. Paul LePage is the likely Republican nominee. 
“I don’t fear losing,” he went on to say. “What has become apparent to me is that I now dread the prospect of winning. Simply put, what I could accomplish in this increasingly unproductive Congress pales in comparison to what I could do in that time as a husband, a father and a son.”
Golden also said that he hopes his departure clears the way for competitive primaries for both parties, claiming that Dunlap and LePage are “a far cry from being standard bearers of the generations that will inherit the legacy of today’s Congress.”
The op-ed comes the same day the ongoing federal government shutdown became the longest in history, with no resolution in sight as Democrats continue to demand Republicans commit to extending health care subsidies before signing on to a stopgap spending proposal. Golden was the only Democrat In the U.S. House to vote in favor of the proposal. 
Though Golden is free to run again without any constraints from term limits, he pointed out that he has long supported those restrictions and likes the idea of leaving his seat in the U.S. House after eight years, which is the same consecutive limit placed on Maine state legislators. 
Pointing to the shutdown, he said he worries Democrats are following Republicans down the path of increased polarization driven by “the most extreme, pugilistic elements of our party.” 
“Luckily, while powerful special interests are pushing us further apart, most Americans are not hyperpartisans,” he said, pointing in particular to the people who live in his 2nd Congressional District, seen as one of the most conservative to be represented by a Democrat. 
Golden listed off several of his accomplishments, including delivering more than $52 million to local projects, working with tribes in Maine to try to “correct a decades-long injustice,” and giving voice to the needs of lobstermen.
“I still believe, perhaps more than ever, that politics can be a positive force,” he added. “But having devoted decades of my life to service, I look forward to my next chapter: raising my young daughters with Izzy — who has shouldered more than her fair share of caring for our family and our home for years — and spending more time with our family and friends.”

Lauren Boebert speaks to supporters during an election night watch party on Nov. 5, 2024 in Windsor, Colorado. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Latino groups in Colorado condemned U.S. Rep Lauren Boebert’s costume at a Halloween party over the weekend, calling it racist and cruel.
Boebert, a Republican who represents Colorado’s 4th Congressional District, dressed in a costume meant to be a Mexican woman, complete with sombrero and sign that mocked a Spanish accent and read “Mexican Word of the Day: JUICY. Tell Me If Juicy ICE coming.”
A person with her appeared to be dressed as a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. A photo of the costume went viral on X over the weekend.
The Colorado Democratic Latino Caucus called it a “deeply racist caricature of our community.”

“Let’s be clear: this was not a “joke.” It was a deliberate act of cruelty and disrespect toward the Latino community at a time when our families are suffering because of Republicans’ dysfunction in Washington,” the caucus said in a statement. Dozens of other Democratic state lawmakers signed on in support.
The district Boebert represents is about 16% Hispanic or Latino, and most of those people have Mexican heritage, according to census data.
The group called for an apology from the congresswoman, as did Voces Unidas, a nonpartisan group that mobilizes Latino voters in Colorado.
“Congresswoman Boebert’s disdain for Latinos is not surprising to those of us who watched her when she represented the Western Slope, but her racist Halloween costume is beneath her already low standards,” Voces Unidas CEO Alex Sanchez said in a statement. “The Trump Administration’s heavy-handed — and often unlawful — ICE raids are traumatic and disrupting to families and communities across Colorado and the country.”
ICE arrests in Colorado have significantly ramped up since President Donald Trump began his second term this year, at one point averaging 17 arrests per day over the summer. It is part of a national effort to fulfill the Trump administration’s mass deportation plan.
“While families are worried about food running out, while children cry because their parents have been detained or deported, while teachers and essential workers are living in fear, Republicans like Lauren Boebert are mocking our pain and using our culture as a prop,” the CDLC statement reads.
A Douglas County teacher, Marina Ortiz, was recently arrested by ICE despite having legal authorization to work in the country, according to school officials. Fernando Jaramillo-Solano and his two children were arrested in Durango in October and are still in custody, even though an ICE official testified that they mistook him for someone else. And immigrant-rights advocate Jeanette Vizguerra is approaching seven months of detainment after being arrested outside her workplace in March.
Boebert’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

He will perform Saturday night in Philadelphia at the Ellis Theater, which is part of the Congress of Country Music, a museum and music venue started by music icon and Neshoba County native Marty Stuart.
Mississippi Today Ideas Editor Bobby Harrison recently interviewed Carll online about his scheduled performance in Mississippi, his songwriting and the current political climate.
The interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Mississippi Today Ideas – How did this Nov. 8 concert at the Ellis Center come about?
Hayes Carll  – We’re just on tour promoting the new record, and we’re covering a lot of grounds. I heard about this, I think, new venue. The association with Marty and the town, just made it a good stop. 
MT Ideas – What can we expect from that concert? 
Carll –  I’m going to have my band out with me. I’ve got a six-piece band. I call them the Gulf Coast Orchestra. I started out on the Gulf Coast of Texas playing music. So that’s been what I called my bands ever since.
It’s a pretty eclectic show. We kind of run the range between singer-songwriter and storytelling stuff. But then we can crank it up. We’ve got some brilliant musicians and we’ll get loud and honky tonk it and rock out.
I like all kinds of music and have been influenced by a lot of different styles. So for me, a fun show is one where I can incorporate all that stuff together.
MT Ideas – I’m assuming you will be playing a lot of stuff from your new album, “We’re Only Human.” It is getting great reviews. You talk about your music and everything, and all that’s true. But I think you’re known for your songwriting ability and this album doesn’t let people down on that front.
I view the album as kind of about the human condition, about redemption, about struggling and learning to live and thrive.
Carll – Thank you. That’s a really good recap actually. Yeah, I think the human experience can be challenging and I’ve had my struggles over time, and I got tired of having the same conversations with myself year after year. I’m just trying probably like most people to find a way to live with a little more peace and little more joy and to not struggle as much. So I reached a point in life where we really leaned into doing some personal work to try and sort out how I can live better. And so this record stemmed from that. A lot of it’s just things I discovered for myself about how to stay sane and joyful and grateful.
Hayes Carll Credit: Joshua Black Wilkins
I wrote it in large part for myself. It was, you know, one big therapy session. I feel like as I’ve gone out and played it for people and shared it with the world I get a lot of feedback that it seems to connect. You know, we’re not that different no matter what our circumstances are.
We all want to feel safe and appreciated and not overwhelmed and able to navigate life with some grace and love. It started off about me, but I think it’s turned into something that hopefully people, regardless of their situation, can relate to and connect with.
MT Ideas – Would you consider this album sort of a departure from your past work? 
Carll – I do in a couple ways. This is my 10th record, and I got into songwriting just because I loved it so much – the storytelling, the ability of songwriters that I looked up to, to articulate my experience or put words to my feelings that I didn’t know how to do to put me in a certain kind of mood to help me find my identity. And there’s so much about it that I just was really excited by.
So when I started writing, I was like most artists, you start off kind of copying your heroes and you slowly start to find your own style and I found I had a lot of different styles and things that I liked to touch on. I would write a song and do it the best I could and then write another song and it came time to make a record.
I would just kind of collect all the songs I had finished and find the best ones or the ones that fit together the best.
This was the first time in my life, in my career,  that I had set out with an intention and a theme about what I wanted to write. It was a very different process for me because of that.
I had some parameters where if it’s not honest, if it’s not helping me sort something out or express something that I felt like I needed to express, then it just wasn’t part of this record. I’ve got a lot in the past of storytelling songs or rock and roll songs, or honky tonk songs or funny songs or things that are touching on specific things, but usually looking from somebody else’s point of view. In this record, I just tried to keep it in a space where I was working toward a goal. And so that was kind of liberating to be able to know that everything I was doing creatively was in this area. 
MT Ideas – Well, if you listen to the words closely though, I still think, you don’t lose your sense of humor, which I think has been an important part of your work for a long time.
Carll – Yeah, thank you. It’s always been important to me. Humor. You know John Prine is a hero of mine. And there’s so many songwriters who can use humor to just be funny or as a contrast to the serious and the heavy. I love the idea of showing the whole human experience and humor and levity and ability to laugh at oneself or at the surroundings.
That’s how I keep my sanity a lot of times. And so even when I’m trying to work through some heavier stuff for me, humor’s always gonna be a part of it.
MT Ideas – Full disclosure. I first learned about you back when my brother-in-law gave me an album – it was actually a CD – called “Trouble in Mind” for Christmas in 2008, 2009.
Carll – Yeah. that’s about right.
MT Ideas – To this day it remains one of my favorite albums. That album I think, it really captured you as a songwriter. I think you have a unique ability to be funny, but also poignant and write tear jerkers at the same time. “Nice things” is not on that album, but it is one of my favorite songs.
Carll – It’s one I wrote with Brothers Osborne, one of my favorite country bands here in Nashville. Yeah, that originally started out as I had this idea of a wife saying to her husband why we can’t have nice things. And at first we were thinking about writing from that point of view. Then we sort of zoomed out and made it more global, universal.
MT Ideas – You made God a woman, and she came back down and just said, whoa, this is why we don’t have nice things. 
Carll – Exactly. She was not thrilled with some of what she saw going on.
MT Ideas – OK. You mentioned John Prine. You’re from Texas. I know Texas is a big state with lots of people, but still it seems like Texas has more than its share of great songwriters going back to Townes Van Zandt, one of my favorites, Guy, Clark, and on and on. You’ve been placed in those categories of songwriters. Are some of those folks your heroes?
Carll  – Absolutely. Texas has a really rich songwriting tradition, musical tradition, just sort of in the air there, I mean, the first memories I have are listening to Willie Nelson.
Kenny Rogers was one of my first. That’s not the same kind of thing as a songwriter, but he was one of my first musical influences. I had an uncle who played in a garage band with Kenny in Houston. It is just kind of everywhere.
Yeah, I, really got heavily into Townes and Guy. Lyle Lovett was maybe the first one for me – his ability to have this unique perspective and this sense of humor and weirdness and elegance and combine all these things that I just didn’t hear on the radio a lot. And, so I really did a deep dive pretty early on into finding all these, to me at the time, obscure singer-songwriters.
They became heroes and now they’re, I think, seen as legends. It’s been really cool for me to come out as those people were my heroes. One of the first co-writes I ever did was with Guy Clark. I got my start in a bar called “The Old Quarter” that Townes had recorded a live record in. I get to tour with Lyle and he’s become a friend, and I’ve toured with Robert Earl Keen. And so for me, as a kid who just looked up to all these guys and viewed them as titans and geniuses and just really brilliant artists, it’s been really gratifying to through the course of  years, get to befriend them, work with them. It’s really special. I have to pinch myself sometimes. 
MT Ideas –  What, what was your thought process writing, ”She left me for Jesus?”
Carll – I have a friend named Brian Keane, who’s a great singer songwriter. And he came over to my apartment. I was living in Austin at the time, and he was kind of going through a situation where his relationship was maybe not going to work out because he was not religious enough.
He brought that idea to me. At first I wasn’t feeling it. I wasn’t sure what to do with that. Sometimes you start a song, and it could take years and you just labor away and sometimes it just happens like that. We got the concept that there was this mistaken identity and that the guy thought his girl was cheating on him with some guy named Jesus and didn’t put it together.
And then we kind of made him a certain type of character and started bringing satire and irony into it. We wrote it in probably an hour, and then we had three or four extra verses as well. It just became one of those things where the ideas were flowing and we’re just poking a little fun at folks who maybe call themselves Christian, but don’t behave in Christian ways or maybe would pick a fight with Jesus if he walked into a bar today.
MT Ideas – There is some controversy going on today with songwriters involved in politics? You have not taken political stances, but sometimes I think your songs do. Can you just talk a little bit about that? 
Carll – First of all, I think on the whole our job is to be artists. I don’t think anybody should be told as an artist what they should or shouldn’t write about. It’s always sort of strange to me when people say people should stick to their lanes.
We’re all people here and I don’t think you have to be an elected official or a talking head on TV to have an opinion and be able to share it. We all have that right. And  particularly as an artist, I feel like our job is to look at the world in a certain way and share that point of view.
You don’t have to agree with it, don’t have to like it. But our job certainly is not to get small and, and not examine what we see.
A lot of my heroes early on were really politically active – Bob Dylan  or Prine in some ways. And so I always admired that, but I never felt quite comfortable finding my voice to express it – on stage or off.
I definitely have some songs where I think I let it be known where I’m coming from or try to challenge certain ideas. Off-stage, it’s a bit more challenging.
I feel like these days, whatever your opinion is or however justified or based in decency or respect you try to make it,  there’s a section of the populist, no matter what side you’re on, that’s gonna come back at you in a pretty unpleasant way. And it’s not that I’m afraid of that blowback, although I don’t enjoy it. But I sometimes feel like I’m just adding to the noise because we seem to have lost the ability to just have a nuanced and respectful conversation.
And so if all I’m doing is throwing fuel out there for people to get upset about, I’m not sure I’m actually accomplishing what I want to accomplish by sharing my opinion. So I just kind of take it as it comes and try to take care of myself and my family and my friends and neighbors.
And I certainly have my opinions and if I feel I need to express them I will and do, but I try not to lead with that. Part of what this record is about is some of that. I like to define people not by their differences or disagreements, but try and find the commonality ’cause I have a lot of people, friends that I disagree with strongly about certain political issues, but I know they’re really good people and so I like to start there and build some commonality and respect there. And then we can argue once we’ve established a baseline of decency.
MT Ideas – Yeah. You have a song on the new record that talks about that, where the couple meets at a rally and yells at each other and then feels bad and goes out to eat together. You have written several songs I think that talk about the ability of people who get along despite their differences.
Carll – Yeah, I feel like we get divided and there’s people who profit off of division and animosity, and I don’t think it’s the regular people who are benefiting from it. And so again I believe everybody should have their belief systems and fight for what they think is important. But sometimes I think with social media and the news 24-7 and all the opinions and all the politics, it can make people think that’s all that we are. And we’re so much more than that. 
MT Ideas – Well, look I appreciate your time. I know you’re busy with your new record and getting ready for your tour, so I thank you for taking some time to be with us.
Carll – I appreciate you having me, and I’m really looking forward to playing.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/04152436/HayesCarll2_794_byJoshuaBlackWilkins-scaled-1.jpeg,,,2025-11-05 16:02:37.904254

The Montana Supreme Court unanimously ruled […]","COVID-19 vaccine is stored at -80 degrees celsius in the pharmacy at Roseland Community Hospital on Dec. 18, 2020 in Chicago. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)In a decision that is both technical and gives both sides a sort of victory, the Montana Supreme Court has ordered part of an anti-vaccine law restored, while opening the door for other legal challenges to the state’s policy of not discriminating against citizens due to their vaccination status.
The Montana Supreme Court unanimously ruled on a lawsuit originally filed during the height of the COVID-19 vaccine controversy, which was happening during the 2021 Legislature. Republican-led lawmakers made it illegal for most businesses to require employees to disclose their vaccination status or treat them differently.
While the law said employers and businesses could require masks, it could not treat people differently based on their vaccine status or require them to be vaccinated as part of their employment. The law created carve-outs for healthcare facilities.
Netzer Law Firm of Billings had challenged the measure, saying it violated a number of state constitutional rights, as well as jeopardized the health and safety of its employees.
It was one of several lawsuits filed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and ultimately state district court Judge Olivia Rieger did not issue an injunction against the law, allowing it to go into effect. The case wound its way to the state’s only appellate court, the Montana Supreme Court, which reviewed the case, determining that Rieger did not abuse her judicial discretion by not issuing an injunction, but sent the case back to be heard on the merits.
However, it was what Rieger did when the case came back to her that became the subject of the appeal the Supreme Court decided on Tuesday. In that decision, the unanimous court said that both attorneys for Netzer and the judge incorrectly interpreted their order by dismissing several components of the constitutional challenge.
It also ruled that Rieger unreasonably struck down a portion of the law the dealing with experimental or emergency vaccines, like the types developed to halt the COVID virus.
  Two different problems, two different mistakes 

The court said just because it had ruled that Rieger did not abuse her judicial discretion by failing to issue a preliminary injunction that would have stopped Montana’s vaccine discrimination law, it didn’t mean that the court was ruling on the merits of the argument. Instead, justices said that Rieger should have heard those challenges and determined the facts surrounding the case.
However, after the Supreme Court sent the case back to the district court, attorneys with Netzer withdrew the bulk of its challenges, believing that to be consistent with the high court’s wishes.
But in its ruling Tuesday, the Supreme Court said that its original order only analyzed the circumstances surrounding the preliminary injunction, and not necessarily the merits of the legal argument of the case.
However, because the attorneys and the judge had dismissed those portions and they were not part of the appeal, the Supreme Court could not and would not analyze those arguments, leaving open that a future lawsuit may be able to challenge the vaccine discrimination law.
“Throughout our opinion, we reiterated that our review did not resolve the underlying merits of Netzer’s claim…(The court) concluded without addressing the merits of Netzer’s claims that House Bill 702 violated none of their fundamental constitutional rights,” the Supreme Court order said. “Its failure to address Netzer’s claims on their merits was a procedurally erroneous treatment of (the case) and a misapplication of our instructions on remand. The District Court’s initial order partially dismissing Netzer’s claims was a procedural error and a manifest error of law.”
Montana was the first state to enact a vaccine discrimination law.
The order also puts some of the error back on the attorneys for Netzer, saying that they did not challenge the district court’s conclusion, and instead rescinded part of their case. Because of that, the Supreme Court said it would not address those arguments, but left the issue open.
  Part of vaccine law likely coming back 

The one part of the bill that Netzer challenged in district court successfully was also overturned.
Originally, the Netzer attorneys said that a section of the law that dealt with experimental or emergency vaccines strayed too far outside the title of the original legislation and therefore should be struck down, an argument Rieger affirmed.
The language of the Section 4 of the bill, which was being challenged is:


“An individual may not be required to receive any vaccine whose use is allowed under an emergency use authorization or any vaccine undergoing safety trials.”
 
Montana’s Constitution, like many states, says bills must contain a single subject and clear title. Netzer attorneys argued experimental vaccines or those issued as part of an emergency were too far afield from the topic of vaccine discrimination.
“The District Court reasons that Subsection 4’s prohibition against requiring vaccines at certain regulatory stages was unrelated to the title’s anti-discrimination purpose,” the court file said.
However, the Supreme Court said the two subjects were reasonably connected, and that decades of case law have been developed around the legal topic. In short, even if the judges could think of better titles or edit the words to provide more clarity, courts cannot substitute their own word preferences for those of lawmakers.
In its ruling, the Supreme Court said the average citizen might expect some rules or policies about vaccines in a general bill about vaccine discrimination. The title of House Bill 702 was, “An Act Prohibiting discrimination Based on a Person’s Vaccination Status or Possession of an Immunity Passport; Providing and Exception and an Exemption; Providing an Appropriation; and Providing Effective Dates.”
“When questioning whether an act’s title is misleading, actual deception is not part of our test. We instead apply an objective standard and assess whether the title is ‘reasonably calculated to give notice of the contents of the bill’ to interested individuals so that they may follow ‘intelligently,’” the court opinion said. “HB 702 does not ‘completely fail’ because the plain language of its title gave interested members of the public and Legislature notice and opportunity to intelligently follow HB 702.”
The Supreme Court sent the case back to Rieger, saying that Netzer failed to meet its “heavy burden” showing the title was unconstitutional, and called it an error to strike that part of the law.
“We express no view on any other constitutional challenges or claims not properly presented,” said the opinion, authored by Justice Beth Baker.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)For much of 2025, Democrats in Virginia campaigned on addressing affordability issues and federal funding cuts handed down by President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress. Virginia’s GOP candidates often campaigned on anti-transgender policies in alignment with Trump — a strategy that voters seemingly rebuked amid the Democratic sweep of the state’s executive branch and gains in the House of Delegates.
Sen. Danica Roem, D-Prince William — Virginia’s first and only trans elected official — doubts her Republican colleagues will make as much of a fuss over her community nor introduce many anti-trans bills in the 2026 legislative session. 
“They have 13 fewer House of Delegates members who could possibly do such a thing,” she said. 
This year, nearly a dozen anti-trans bills were introduced and failed in the Democrat-controlled legislature. Still, the matter featured prominently across campaigns. Republicans had also pointed to a Northern Virginia sex offender who has identified as transgender in court documents as cause for cracking down on bathroom access. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and Attorney General Jason Miyares were joined by national anti-trans activist Riley Gaines to celebrate the introduction of a bill that would ban transgender athletes.
Most prominent, however, were digital ads, text message campaigns and stump speeches from Earle-Sears, the GOP gubernatorial nominee who lost to Democrat Abigail Spanberger by about 15 points in unofficial election results Tuesday night.

Roem said campaigns make “strategic assumptions” on key issues they assume can rally and sustain their bases. For Republican candidates this year, they sought to build on successful campaigns from Youngkin and Trump, for which trans issues had featured. They were bolstered by outside organizations like the American Principles Project PAC, which sent a pre-Halloween mass text message featuring an artificial intelligence image of Spanberger posed like a horror movie poster. 
“Monsters preying upon children. Predators in little girl’s locker rooms,” it read. “This isn’t a horror movie, it’s Virginia under Abigail Spanberger.”
Likewise, the closing messages from Earle-Sears’ campaign in attack ads against Spanberger asserted she is “for they/them not us” an echo of an attack Trump levied against Kamala Harris. 
Though the debate over transgender rights have percolated nationally in recent years,  transgender individuals make up a small demographic of Americans. Data shows 3.3% of youth nationwide identify as transgender. 
Recent polling from the Washington Post and George Mason University shows that 3% of voters saw transgender policies as a top-of-mind issue.
“They put this out there, and they were wrong,” Roem said of the Republican strategy and added that the Republican Governors Association “wasted millions of dollars” it poured into Virginia’s races this year.
While not referencing specific cultural issues, the Republican Party of Virginia posted a statement to social media that noted how remaining Republicans in the state legislature are “committed and determined to continue fighting for the values that make our Commonwealth great and for the policies that will empower Virginians to thrive.”
“We look forward to working with all of them to push back against radical Democrat extremism in Richmond and beyond,” the account wrote. 
While Virginia lawmakers will prepare for the 2026 legislative session in the coming months and which priorities they will agree to tackle, national political mechanisms are already at work for the 2026 Congressional midterm elections. 
U.S. Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Delaware, joined a call with the Human Rights Campaign and Equality Virginia on Wednesday afternoon. As the nation’s first transgender member of Congress, she celebrated the Democratic wins in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City on Tuesday. 
McBride called Virginia’s election results amid the anti-trans messaging that saturated it, a “clear repudiation of a cynical political strategy.”
She added that candidates’ attitudes of being “curious, not judgmental” of constituents with different viewpoints while keeping their platforms rooted in solving affordability issues may offer a winning blueprint for next year’s contests.

(Getty Images)Last week, New Hampshire’s Republican-majority Executive Council blocked $5.5 million intended for low-income people who cannot afford a defense attorney. In leading the charge to withhold funds supporting the constitutionally guaranteed right to legal representation, Manchester Republican John Stephen said: “We’re not even checking to see if these individuals have assets, have income. I don’t know what we’re doing.”
On one level, I get it. Among the responsibilities we assign to our public servants is the oversight of the way public money is spent, and Stephen and his Republican partners can argue that’s just what they’re doing. But the Republican instinct to block funding that assists those nefarious actors known as low-income people, in advance of any examination of the system in question, is indicative not only of the party’s cynical rot but its defining hypocrisy.
What I mean is, it’s very unlikely you would hear a Republican official say: “Before we approve these business tax cuts, we need some assurances that the tax advantages created will directly benefit lower-income workers in this land of the $7.25 minimum wage. Otherwise, I don’t know what we’re doing.”
The poor will try to take you for every penny, goes the Republican philosophy, but those at the top of the wealth ladder and the corporations they operate should be trusted fully, deeply, perpetually. That’s the thread running through the bulk of Republican policy. It’s there in Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s redefining of what it means to be vulnerable in order to sell voters on higher Medicaid premiums and copays, just as it shapes the enormous, era-defining inequity of the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
The tale we are told is that people with nothing are robbing us blind, even though the truth lies elsewhere and is not hard to find. For example, the nation’s tax gap — or the difference between taxes owed and taxes the Internal Revenue Service is equipped to collect — is estimated at about $1 trillion per year. Even when President Donald Trump’s former IRS commissioner, Charles Rettig, tells the American people that “most of the unpaid taxes are the result of evasion by the wealthy and large corporations,” still Republicans claim the real problem is the absence of work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP (despite all of the evidence to the contrary) or, apparently, legal services for the indigent.
As I write, sky-high grocery bills, property taxes, housing costs, and health care hikes are pushing the people of New Hampshire ever closer to the brink. Life’s math isn’t working, the people keep telling their elected officials, but the answer from our Republican leaders is that we the people are just looking at the wrong numbers. Did you see, asks the governor, New Hampshire’s awesome third-place ranking on the Tax Foundation’s “most competitive tax structure” list last week? Did you notice, says our president, how terrific the stock market is doing these days?
I’m sorry, I didn’t. We didn’t. It’s just that, well, with winter coming and the heating bills on top of everything else, the whole financial house of cards is starting to feel a little shaky, you know? And that’s for the lucky ones who aren’t getting wiped out by the federal government shutdown — the families losing paychecks, food assistance, and child care programs.
But congratulations on the Tax Foundation thing and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, I guess.
To be clear, I have little to offer when it comes to fixes that would be palatable in this Republican political moment. I’m not aware of all the small ways our systems are inefficient or how to reconfigure those systems in a manner that doesn’t unleash irreparable harm. I do, however, feel certain that the wealthy giving back too little is a much more consequential problem for this state and nation than the poor taking too much.
I’m certain because, as Oxfam noted in a report published this week, in the past year the 10 richest U.S. billionaires grew $698 billion richer.
I’m certain because, as inequality.org reported in September, the richest top 0.1% of Americans are worth a combined $22.48 trillion and the bottom 50% are worth a total of $2.44 trillion.
I’m certain because despite the tax gap mentioned earlier, New Hampshire keeps doling out breaks to corporations and the wealthy and the Trump administration keeps gutting the IRS to make tax evasion and avoidance easier.
I’m certain because, try as I might, I just can’t seem to see poverty as the lucrative endeavor Republicans tell me it is.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/rakemoney-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-11-05 16:02:37.904254

(Photo by Alyssa Chen/Minnesota Reformer)Doctors, physicians’ assistants, and nurse practitioners at Allina clinics across the Twin Cities metro area held a one-day strike Wednesday to pressure the multistate health system into giving them a contract.
Allina Doctors Council-SEIU — comprising over 600 members in what the union says is the nation’s largest private-sector health care provider union — announced the unfair labor practice strike two weeks ago. The strike is the first of its kind in Minnesota, union organizers said. It included clinics across the Twin Cities metro area as well as one clinic in River Falls, Wisconsin.
According to a statement from Minneapolis-based Allina Health, 25% of providers represented by the union crossed the picket line Wednesday.
At a rally at Allina Health West St. Paul, speakers addressed press and fellow physicians as passing cars honked in response to strike signs. The union gave Allina a proposal on safe staffing levels months ago, which the health system has refused to bargain on, said Cora Walsh, a family doctor and union organizer. Other demands include a contract with higher wages and employment benefits written in ink.
“We are asking for paid sick and vacation time so we can care for ourselves and our families so we can be there year after year caring for our patients,” said Walsh.
Arnold London, 77, works half-time as a pediatrician at Allina Health Bandana Square. London started practicing in 1977 and said he never imagined he would be on a picket line until recently, thanks to worsening conditions in lab services and staffing levels.
Like London, family physician Yer Xiong, 52, didn’t expect to find herself in a union when she graduated from medical school 20 years ago.
“Most of us went into medicine because we feel like it’s a calling, and it’s almost like we feel guilty doing this and are turning our backs on our patients if we do this,” Xiong said. “But the reason to do this is that we want our profession to be sustained for the long term.”
Health care has changed dramatically since most physicians began their careers, Walsh said, thanks to decisions made in “corporate power structures that feel far removed from the exam rooms.”
Indeed, a substantial body of research reviewed by health policy research organization KFF shows that the broad trend of health care consolidation — hospitals and clinics combining into sprawling health systems like Allina — has led to worsening labor conditions even for physicians and other well paid practitioners.
At Allina, management has become increasingly corporate and distant, multiple physicians at Wednesday’s picket said.
Beth Gunhus was a pediatric nurse practitioner for 26 years before she was laid off when Allina closed its Inver Grove clinic last week. Gunhus said that there used to be a CEO dinner once or twice a year, but she has never even seen Lisa Shannon, the CEO as of 2022. Union organizer Matt Hoffman and pediatrician Beth Dietz also said they’ve never met Shannon, who made over $3 million in 2023, according to public tax documents.
Allina’s statement in response to the strike said in part that “it would be irresponsible for either party to agree to a contract that adds significant new expenses that will undermine access and increase costs to those who pay for care,” citing climbing costs and anticipated cuts in government funding.
The next bargaining session is scheduled for early December, Hoffman said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0540-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-05 16:02:37.904254

(Photo by Chris Ryan/Getty Images) (This photo cannot be republished without a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY — A group of immigrant students in Oklahoma, represented by a Latino civil rights group, is seeking to appeal a federal judge’s ruling that they cannot pay in-state tuition anymore. 
The Trump administration’s U.S. Department of Justice in September filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma and successfully rescinded a state law that allowed in-state tuition at Oklahoma’s public colleges and universities for students without legal immigration status in select circumstances. Oklahoma’s attorney general sided with the DOJ. 
The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund filed Sept. 27 in federal court to intervene in the case on behalf of a group of students without legal status with the intent of eventually appealing the judge’s order. Attorneys argued that since the state of Oklahoma will not appeal on behalf of these students, the civil rights group must be allowed to. 
A federal judge ordered the law rescinded in August and the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education adjusted state policy in September to comply with the change. Oklahoma higher education officials estimated the policy change would affect about 400 students in the state who will now have to pay out-of-state tuition. 
The DOJ argued the state law offering in-state tuition to these students is a violation of federal law because the treatment offered to immigrants was not also extended to out-of-state U.S. citizens. 
Under the now-rescinded law, students without legal status could qualify for in-state tuition if they graduated high school in the state and resided in Oklahoma for at least two years prior to graduation. 
“No administration, of either party, has previously challenged these long-extant laws, which recognize that states benefit from making higher education available to all students who grew up in their communities,” said Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel for the Latino civil rights group, in a statement. “The current assault on such equity has no basis in the law, and the assault is even more troubling when political collusion leads to requests to end these longstanding state laws on the very day the case is filed by the federal government.”
The civil rights group, along with the Tulsa-based firm Lizama Law, represent Oklahoma Students for Affordable Tuition, a group of college students without legal immigration status. 
The groups argued that the policy allowing these immigrants in-state tuition was in place for over two decades. 
In a court filing, attorneys offered examples of three affected students who will not be able to afford tuition that is suddenly thousands of dollars more than expected, forcing them to either take out loans or end their education, according to a news release. 
“This is another lawsuit that is part of a disturbing pattern where the federal government seeks to punish states for making higher education accessible to undocumented students,” said attorney Fernando Nuñez in a statement. “Oklahoma’s decision to capitulate not only abandons our clients but also undermines the state’s investment in their talent and future contributions to their communities.”
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said his office will oppose “any attempt to reopen a case that has been properly concluded or to undermine the rule of law.”
“The State of Oklahoma has already resolved this matter in federal court through a lawful consent judgment that upholds fairness to all students,” he said in a statement. “The U.S. District Court correctly found that providing in-state tuition rates to those in the country illegally violated federal law. This latest filing by an outside group has no bearing on that sound decision.”
Proceedings in this case are on hold until Congress reopens the federal government and appropriations are restored to the DOJ, according to the case docket.

The bill is a priority for the Florida House, which has passed similar legislation in past legislative sessions, but its fate in the Senate, where no companion bill has been filed to date, remains unclear. 
The House Civil Justice & Claims Subcommittee passed HB 145 nearly unanimously. Rep. Vicki Lopez, a Republican from Miami, casted the lone dissenting vote against the bill. Once again the legislation is being sponsored by Sarasota Republican Rep. Fiona McFarland.
“It’s a measured response to a centuries-old doctrine that strengthens fairness, consistency, and accountability in our system,” McFarland said while describing the 2026 legislation and how it updates state law.
Notably, the bill increases from $200,000 to $500,000 the amount that’s recoverable per person and ups from $300,000 to $1 million the cap for multiple claims or judgements arising out of the same incident.
The new caps would apply to claims that occur between Oct. 1, 2026, and Sept. 30, 2031. After five years the caps would increase to $600,000 and $1,200,000, respectively.
Opponents, including the Florida League of Cities, argue public entities can ill afford any increased liability, especially as the Legislature mulls over proposals to reduce or eliminate taxes for homestead properties in the coming year.
 The King cannot commit a legal wrong

Sovereign immunity stems from the Latin phrase “rex non potest peccare,” which translates to “the king cannot commit a legal wrong.” In legal terms, it refers to the state’s authority to exempt itself as a legal sovereign from civil lawsuits, although the state does allow negligence claims against itself and its subdivisions — agencies, cities, counties, and public hospitals — within limits.
Injured parties can sue for damages and collect within the liability thresholds established by law, but if they win awards in excess of the limits they must go to the Legislature in the form of what’s called a claims bill to collect. But the claims bill process is lengthy. It also allows the defendant to challenge the jury verdict at the legislative level.
Once a claims bill is filed, each chamber’s presiding officer refers it to a special master, who essentially reconsiders the jury’s recommendation. Claims bills also go before House and Senate committees that consider special masters’ recommendations. Ultimately, the bills must pass in both chambers.
McFarland said ultimately only about 25% of the claims bills filed each year are passed by the Legislature.
“And we’re not talking about financial windfalls. By law, damages can only be compensatory, not punitive. Over half of the claims bills that have passed over the last 10 years have been for under $1 million,” she said.

Because of the large swath of interests the legislation has attracted scores of lobbyist registrations.
City of South Daytona council man Brandon Young
City of South Daytona councilman Brandon Young, was among those who testified against the bill in the subcommittee.
“I can respect and agree with the need for change. But as the saying goes, all politics is local and as a local elected official I have to look at what we can do, what we have to do and what we should do,” Brandon said, noting that over the past three years the costs of the insurance premiums for the city of 14,000 people has increased by more than 42%.
“We all know that’s the topic of this legislative session. We’re all concerned about Florida’s families and affordability. Housing, insurance, utility costs, all those factors. If local governments are forced to absorb higher liability costs in a period of potential major changes in our property tax structure, I’m just not sure where we land at this,” Young said.
McFarland though countered that local governments have never supported changing the caps, noting that that opponents have used everything from the COVID epidemic to rising insurance costs to argue against the bill.

(Photo: Stock photo/Getty Images)After two and a half hours of arguments before the nation’s highest court, the wait begins. Small business owners and entrepreneurs opposed to President Donald Trump’s tariffs are closely watching whether the U.S. Supreme Court will allow or block Trump’s sweeping tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).
The Trump administration says the tariffs are necessary to rectify steep trade imbalances with China and other trading partners. But opponents from across the political spectrum argue the tariffs amount to taxation, a power granted by the U.S. Constitution only to Congress, not the president.
Pittsboro entrepreneur Joshua Esnard thought he was living the American Dream. Then the tariffs hit.
Joshua Esnard
Esnard is the CEO and founder of The Cut Buddy, a shaping tool for haircuts and beards. His innovative product line and entrepreneurial spirit won a deal on the TV show “Shark Tank” in 2017.
Esnard believed this would be the year that his small business would be profitable enough to move toward expansion.
“A lot of my products are tools like clippers, shavers and trimmers. We do not manufacture these parts in the United States,” he said. “If we did, the product would cost $400 or $500.”
To keep his products affordable, Esnard turned to China for production.
“Earlier this year when we faced 150% tariffs, I was facing major purchase orders from Walmart, Target and CVS,” Esnard said. “Imagine having all those goods on the water and then facing that tariff when your products arrive.”
To keep his product in major retailers, he spent over $600,000 on tariffs this year when he had anticipated spending no more than $80,000.
The Cut Buddy has cut consultants and reluctantly cut staff, hoping to avoid shifting the cost of tariffs to price-conscious consumers.
Esnard has taken out merchant cash advance loans to cover the unexpected tariffs. He calls the loans predatory, and worries what will happen to the broader economy when small businesses like his eventually default.
“This is subprime happening again,” Esnard said. “All of us are taking out loans to pay for these tariffs.”
Razor-thin profits squeezed even further 
Mary Carol Dodd, a certified organic vegetable farmer in western North Carolina, never envisioned she’d be glued to a case on presidential powers, but she is.
Mary Carol Dodd
“We grow high value crops and sell them for a CSA program, farmers markets, and local restaurants. These across-the-board tariffs have had a real impact on small farms like mine,” Dodd said on Tuesday.
Dodd is the owner of Red Scout Farm near Black Mountain, farming on land her family has owned for 125 years. Once she started talking to her suppliers, she realized just how many of the products that they use come from overseas.
“Supplies we depend on come from Canada, Mexico, and India, things like greenhouse materials, potting soil, tools, seeds, and insect netting,” Dodd explained. “Our plastic bags, woven ground cover and insect netting have all increased by at least 10%, an AC unit replacement for a walk-in cooler has increased by 50%, and the t-shirts, tanks and hoodies that our staff wear and we sell to our customers have increased by about 30%.”
Profit margins are already razor thin, so every increase means tough choices.
The small, diversified farm must decide whether to raise prices for customers or cut costs elsewhere, likely at the expense of better pay for its workers.
Surviving Helene only to face a new storm  
To add insult to injury, as Western North Carolina residents rebuild from hurricane Helene, the tariffs have increased the raw cost of building materials, fixtures, and appliances.
Benjamin Colvin
“Insurance adjusters, they came last fall to farms, homes and businesses, and insurance claims were paid based on building costs at that time,” Dodd said. “When tariffs came into effect in the spring and summer, the cost of the materials rose, and now insurance checks are not sufficient to complete rebuilding projects. This is a huge problem, not just for farmers and small business owners, but anyone trying to rebuild.”
Devil’s Foot co-founder Benjamin Colvin couldn’t agree more.
Colvin said his Asheville craft-soda business slowly built back from Helene in 2024, only to be confronted with an economic storm in 2025.
This month he saw organic cane sugar, a key ingredient in his product, jump 10 cents a pound. Aluminum tariffs have increased costs by an additional 10% to 20%.
“From craft soda to beer to kombucha to anything that’s using aluminum packaging, we’re all getting hit,” said Colvin.
When the local chamber of commerce purchased his sodas for a trade show in Canada, Devil’s Foot was met by a three-day hold in a retaliatory response to the Trump tariffs.
“One of our founding tenets is protecting people and the planet. And that means trying to get your farm-to-can soda in the hands of people, instead of very high sugar, high fructose, artificially flavored things, and it’s really hard to do that when you keep having to increase prices and pass it on to the consumer.”
The Trump administration has indicated that should the Supreme Court block the president’s use of executive powers in this case, they will seek another route to continue the tariffs. Trump’s tariffs have reportedly generated nearly $195 billion in revenue this fiscal year.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2209983026-1024x663.jpg,,,2025-11-05 15:17:59.590655

(Photo by Getty Images)It will be at least another week before low-income Hoosier families will receive reduced food assistance benefits for November, a state agency said Wednesday.
The benefits through the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP, have been in doubt amid the ongoing partial federal government shutdown, which has curtailed spending by many federal agencies.
Federal judges have ordered President Donald Trump’s administration to use contingency funds to pay at least a portion of benefits to the 42 million people who receive SNAP assistance.
The Indiana Family and Social Services Administration said Wednesday that it was recalculating benefit allotments to 274,000 SNAP households in the state. Benefit changes made by federal officials will reduce the maximum amount to a household by 50%.
The agency said November SNAP benefit distribution “will be delayed by at least one week.”
“We understand the urgency of this situation and are working swiftly to complete the recalculations and resume benefit issuance as soon as possible,” the FSSA statement said. “In the meantime, Hoosiers in need of immediate food assistance are encouraged to call 211 or contact their local food bank.”
Republicans on Indiana’s State Budget Committee rejected last week a proposal from Democrats to direct state surplus funding toward providing SNAP benefits, which total about $112 million a month.
Tables distributed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture indicate that in 48 states, including Indiana, the maximum reduced November benefits will range from $149 a month for a one-person household to $497 for a four-person household and $894 for a household of eight.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1287472642-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-05 15:17:59.590655

Oct. 28, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)DUNBAR, Neb. — Two days after launching her campaign, former State Sen. Julie Slama of Dunbar suspended her 2026 campaign for state treasurer and endorsed Fremont Mayor and State Treasurer-designate Joey Spellerberg.
Slama, in a two-paragraph statement Wednesday, said she sought to bring “new energy and a fresh perspective” to the State Treasurer’s Office. But after speaking with Spellerberg following the resignation of State Treasurer Tom Briese and Gov. Jim Pillen’s subsequent appointment of Spellerberg, she bowed out.
“I believe Joey will bring the energy and perspective needed in the role of state treasurer,” Slama said.
Nebraska’s state treasurer serves a four-year term with an annual salary of $85,000. The treasurer monitors the flow of public dollars for the state, with nearly $20 billion spread among pots of money from the state and federal governments and more. The office maintains a public database on state spending.
Slama on Monday had pledged to work “tirelessly to deliver conservative wins” and prevent tax dollars from going toward “radical liberal investments.” Slama decided not to seek reelection to the Legislature in 2024 after six years as a state senator.
Nebraska State Treasurer Tom Briese resigns, Pillen appoints Fremont mayor Joey Spellerberg

On Monday, Spellerberg told reporters he would bring his mayoral approach of controlling government spending to the state. He also intends to play a role in Pillen’s continued push to lower property taxes. 
Property taxes had been a dividing point between Pillen and Slama in her final legislative year. She opposed Pillen-backed plans that Briese had advocated for and helped create. The plans were heavily dependent on expanded sales taxes.
While the treasurer has no formal role in that regard, Briese served as a lieutenant supporting Pillen’s ideas, such as in broadening the state’s sales tax base and having the state take on more of the burden of funding local schools.
Briese said he was resigning to spend more time with family after seven years as a state lawmaker and two years as treasurer. He is still a member of the state’s new School Financing Review Commission focused on revamping state funding of K-12 schools and lowering property taxes.
Briese’s final day is Thursday. He was appointed to the office Nov. 1, 2023, after the resignation of former State Treasurer John Murante. Spellerberg will be sworn into the office shortly after Briese’s resignation.
Slama would have faced Spellerberg in the May 12 Nebraska GOP primary for treasurer. She said that too often in the Republican Party, primary races can turn into “expensive and bitter feuds with no upside for voters or for our party.”
“This race will not be one of those circumstances,” Slama wrote.
Slama said she plans to refund any donations received in the past 48 hours. She thanked her family, friends and others for their support. She did not immediately respond to a text about how many donations she had received, or whether she intended to run for a different office in 2026.
Spellerberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. His team said it was preparing a statement.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Less than 12 hours after Democrats swept Virginia’s three statewide offices and expanded their majority in the House of Delegates to at least 64 of 100 seats, Gov. Glenn Youngkin addressed reporters and administration officials in a packed meeting room at the Patrick Henry Building in Richmond’s Capitol Square Wednesday morning.
Democrats sweep Virginia’s statewide races, reclaiming full control of executive branch

He used the appearance to reflect on his four-year term and begin publicly shaping how he wants his legacy to be viewed.
Youngkin began by congratulating Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger and offering practical cooperation.
“She will build her team, she will run her transition. And we will support her in that process, so that she and her team can hit the ground running,” he said.
 Legacy claims and record setting

Youngkin emphasized what he described as his administration’s achievements.
“We came in four years ago with an incredibly ambitious agenda. And we have worked diligently, tirelessly, and we’ve accomplished an extraordinary amount.” 
He hailed a Virginia with “record job growth, record investment, and record opportunity,” a safer state, and major business commitments. 
“There’s $143 billion of commitments from companies to expand in the commonwealth. That’s as much as the last five administrations combined. That underpins another 85,000 jobs and 40,000 construction jobs.  At the end of the day, that’s what we have to focus on,” Youngkin said.
The governor also reiterated his signature belief that economic growth is Virginia’s mechanism for opportunity.
“And if I have one great piece of advice for anyone who is serving as governor, whether it’s Gov.-elect Spanberger, or 10 governors from now, it’s we must continue to drive economic prosperity through job creation. ” 
 Reading the election results

Spanberger’s win and the capture of lieutenant governor and attorney general offices by state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, and former delegate Jay Jones, alongside the House gains, triggered numerous interpretations of the public’s message.
Blue wave rebuilds the House: Democrats soar to at least 64 seats in Virginia

Youngkin declined to assign his party’s losses to his own performance, instead citing external factors. At Wednesday’s briefing, a reporter asked the governor whether the outcome in Virginia was a repudiation of President Donald Trump’s policies, especially around federal workforce issues. 
“There are going to be pundit after pundit after pundit who will un-pick the results,” Youngkin pushed back. “I, as a governor, will today do exactly what I knew I would be doing today, and that is preparing to finish strong.”
He pointed directly to the federal government shutdown and its accompanying economic concerns.
“It is a big, big challenge, I have been vocal about it,” he said. “I think that we have 330,000 federal workers in the commonwealth of Virginia, and to have this shutdown extending as the longest shutdown ever, has been extraordinary for so many Virginians. People are going without paychecks, they’re worried about mortgages and rents. They’re worried about how they’re going to feed their families.”
On whether Republicans lost because his administration was viewed differently than he believes, Youngkin insisted he believes that “Virginians thoroughly support what we’ve been doing.” 
He cited the surpluses and tax relief: “We’ve run $10 billion of surpluses, and we’ve had $9 billion of tax relief.”
 Scandal and future prospects

Youngkin didn’t shy from commenting on the controversy surrounding Jones, the incoming attorney general, whose 2022 text exchange with a Republican lawmaker in which he fantasized about shooting then-House Speaker Todd Gilbert and the death of his children became a campaign issue. 
“They were abhorrent, and I think that they once again reiterate that you can’t come into this job if you are espousing death on a political enemy, the death of children, and the death of law enforcement. And I believe… that disqualifies him for the job,” Youngkin said. 
He added that the next administration “will have to figure out how to deal with that, because they have law enforcement that they’re going to need to make sure feel good about doing the job… and that parents, with children, feel safe.”
When asked how the election results might influence his own political trajectory, Youngkin remained focused on the job at hand and did not offer any clarity on plans beyond his term. 
“My focus has been, will be, and will continue to be on the commonwealth of Virginia up until the last second.” 
 The Democratic rally cry

Also on Wednesday, the Democratic House majority held a news conference at the nearby General Assembly Building. 
Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, declared the pickup of 13 seats “is what a mandate looks like.” 
“We even ran ahead of the top of the ticket and a number of seats, demonstrating the strength of our campaigns. This is the largest democratic majority we’ve won in more than three decades,” Scott said.
He blamed the GOP’s’ widespread defeat on the party’s failure to push back against the president’s policies. 
“Until Republicans decide to stand up to Donald Trump and to MAGA extremism, this will continue to happen,” Scott said. 
David Richards, a political-science professor at University of Lynchburg, described the results as “pretty eye-opening,” which set the stage for the 2026 midterm elections. 
“I give a lot of credit to Spanberger for staying on point with the pocket-book issues that voters seemed concerned about,” Richards said, adding that the GOP’s emphasis on culture-war themes “did not work as well, so they will have to find another angle.” 
He noted Youngkin could face headwinds in his future political ambitions: “Youngkin may have some trouble ahead, if he is blamed for the Virginia loss.”

 National ripple effects

The Democratic thrust in Virginia is part of a broader wave. 
Trump remained largely silent on social media following defeats in Virginia, New Jersey and New York, but addressed Republican senators Wednesday morning at a breakfast in Washington, D.C. 
“Last night, it was, you know, not expected to be a victory… it was very Democrat areas. But I don’t think it was good for Republicans,” he said. 
“I’m not sure it was good for anybody… I thought we’d have a discussion after the press leaves about what last night represented and what we should do about it. And also about the shutdown and how that relates to last night. I think if you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans, and that was a big factor.”
And on X, formerly Twitter, longtime Virginia GOP strategist and Trump’s 2024 campaign manager Chris LaCivita blamed the Republican defeat on Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican gubernatorial nominee who lost to Spanberger by nearly 15 points. 
“A Bad candidate and Bad campaign have consequences — the Virginia Governors race is example number 1,” LaCivita wrote late Tuesday. 
 Advocacy voices join the chorus

Major national and state advocacy groups weighed in as well. 
The Democratic National Committee’s Ken Martin said in a statement that “across Virginia, commonwealth voters made it clear what they were looking for from their next governor: lower costs, good jobs, affordable health care, and strong schools. … Those same voters made it clear who they want to lead: Abigail Spanberger.” 
The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee’s Heather Williams called the outcome “an earthquake election in Virginia … Democrats ran winning campaigns across every corner of the state, clinching nearly every target race and netting the biggest House majority in nearly 40 years.”
From the civil-rights side, the ACLU of Virginia’s Mary Bauer emphasized that the election was “a critical step to protect the civil rights and civil liberties of everyone in Virginia … Voters delivered decisive wins to pro-civil-rights candidates up and down the ballot.” 
Meanwhile, the Blue Ridge Abortion Fund’s April Greene emphasized that abortion care – one of the key issues in the 2025 election cycle — is “a divine, human right. This victory is proof that our communities believe it too.” 
And from gun-safety advocates, the Giffords PAC described the sweep as “a major victory for public safety in Virginia. With last night’s wins and the election of a gun-safety champion in Governor-elect Spanberger, we know a safer future is coming to the commonwealth.”
As Youngkin winds down his term, his tone Wednesday was firm, forward-looking and intent on defining his legacy — even in the face of a partisan shift in Richmond. 
The outgoing governor framed his remaining months as an opportunity to “finish strong” and hand off a stronger commonwealth. 
“We have worked together in order to meet extraordinary moments,” he said.

Judge George Collins Jr. granted a temporary restraining order to stop the 10% cut in Medicaid rates paid to providers of autism therapies after parents argued that the state illegally targeted those treatments for deep reductions. 
The temporary restraining order will last until Nov. 10, when the court will hold a hearing on a preliminary injunction. 
Michael F. Easley Jr., a former U.S. Attorney representing the families, in a statement, called the court’s decision “a victory for every North Carolina family fighting to give their child with autism a far start in life.”
The state Department of Health and Human Services started paying Medicaid health care providers anywhere from 3% to 10% less on Oct. 1. 
DHHS leaders claimed the reductions were necessary because the legislature failed to pass a budget that fully funded the health insurance program’s cost increases. Republican legislators argued that DHHS did not need to cut rates immediately and could have continued into next year without a money infusion. 
The lawsuit was brought by 21 children through their parents or guardians. The children are benefiting from or are on waiting lists for ABA therapy. Applied Behavioral Analysis aims to improve social skills and communication, increase positive behavior and reduce negative behavior, according to the Cleveland Clinic. 
The lawsuit says ABA helped children with autism communicate and regulate their emotions. Without the therapy, they face slower progress or regression, the suit says.
 “Those significant threats to plaintiffs’ ongoing treatment and care are the natural consequences of the cuts’ impact on therapy providers, who will be forced to reduce their staffing, cancel or change planned expansions, reduce services to Medicaid patients, and further delay accepting new patients off already long waitlists,” the suit says. 
Lawyers representing DHHS opposed the temporary restraining order, writing that other Medicaid services’ rates also received 10% cuts, and there was no evidence that discrimination motivated the reduction for autism therapy. 
They also challenged declarations by ABA providers supporting the plaintiffs that their businesses would become unprofitable or have to close because of the cuts. Many of those providers currently operate in states where Medicaid reimbursement rates are even lower than North Carolina’s reduced rate, the state lawyers wrote. 
The state Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement that it will comply with the temporary restraining order, and is waiting for the court to put it in writing.
But the court requirement to reverse the rate cut means Medicaid will run out of money sooner, the statement said. 
“This order makes the need for the General Assembly to fund Medicaid even more urgent,” the statement said. “Any reinstatement or reversal of the provider cuts without additional funding from the General Assembly means the program will run out of funding sooner, putting the entire state Medicaid system at risk. Without additional funding and implementation of the October 1 rate cuts, North Carolina could run out of NC Medicaid funds as early as April 2026.”
“If the NCGA fully funds NC Medicaid, the Department will reevaluate all cuts and take action to reverse or modify cuts to ensure NC Medicaid can operate within the appropriated budget,” the statement continued.   
The statement also said agency leaders understand the cuts are causing hardships for Medicaid providers and patients, but said they were “unavoidable” due to insufficient funding from the General Assembly.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AutismSpectrum-Art.jpg,,,2025-11-05 15:17:59.590655

(Photo by Barbara Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The fate of an Oklahoma County killer with an upcoming execution date is in the hands of Gov. Kevin Stitt.
The Pardon and Parole Board on Wednesday voted 3-2 to recommend clemency for Tremane Wood, 46.
Wood is set to die Nov. 13 for the 2002 stabbing death of Ronnie Wipf, 19, during a robbery at an Oklahoma City motel. Wipf was a migrant farm worker from Montana.
“I’m not a monster,” Wood told the board by way of video conference from Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. “I’m not a killer. I never was and I never have been.”
Wood said he took full responsibility for his actions and his misconduct while on death row. He is accused of dealing in drugs, perpetuating violence against another inmate and having contraband cell phones, according to prison disciplinary records.
“Being in this place is like being in quicksand,” he said. “The more you struggle to get out, sometimes the deeper you sink into the culture.”
Amanda Bass Castro Alves, Wood’s lawyer, said Wednesday that his trial attorney was abusing alcohol and drugs and did not adequately represent him. His brother, Zjaiton “Jake” Wood, admitted to the killing, had better counsel and investigators, and got life without parole, she said. Zjaiton Wood  died in prison in 2019. 
Tremane Wood’s trial attorney died in 2018.
“We know Tremane’s death sentence is not a just result,” Alves said.
The victim’s mother doesn’t want Tremane Wood executed, she said.
Members of the victim’s family declined to participate in the clemency hearing.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said Wood was a violent offender who still posed a threat to the public.
Clemency is not a right, Drummond said.
He said Wood continued his predatory behavior while behind bars.
“I am disappointed by the Pardon and Parole Board’s decision today but appreciate their thoughtful deliberation,” he said in a statement after the decision. “My office will continue to pursue justice for Ronnie Wipf. We intend to make our case to the governor on why clemency should not be granted and why the death sentence, as determined by a jury, should be carried out.”
Assistant Attorney General Christina Burns said Tremane Wood’s death sentence was the result of the choices he made.
Claims about inadequate representation by Wood’s trial attorney were rejected by the court system, she said.
Members Susan Stava, Robert Reavis II and Kevin Buchanan voted to recommend clemency. Members Richard A. Miller and Sean Malloy voted against it.
Cheers were heard in the meeting room following the vote.
Stitt’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Photo by Don Kruse for the Florida Phoenix)A bill forcing all Florida employers to use a federal verification tool to determine whether new hires are legally in the country passed its first hurdle Wednesday.
HB 197, sponsored by Seminole Republican Rep. Berny Jacques, expands a 2023 law championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis to require all employers — not just public businesses and larger private ones — to use the online database, called E-Verify. This is Jacques’ second attempt to pass the expansion, and comes amid a national push by Republicans to increasingly crack down on illegal immigration.
“It simply enforces the law,” Jacques said in Wednesday’s House Industries & Professional Activities Subcommittee. “It’s already illegal to hire these unauthorized workers, and we have a system that will verify whether or not you are in compliance with the law.”
Passing along party lines, Jacques’ bill is a near-identical version of his measure from last year, which passed the Florida House with bipartisan support but never gained traction in the upper chamber. It changes current law to require E-Verify for all private businesses, not just those with at least 25 workers.
This year, Jacques hopes it will be different.
“I remain optimistic, but at the end of the day, you can only control what you can control,” he said, adding that the governor’s office has been “supportive and helpful” in backing his legislation. As for the Senate, Jacques says he’s spoken with some senators who’ve appeared “particularly” receptive to sponsoring  a companion bill.
The Senate’s E-Verify bill in 2025 was never scheduled for a committee.
More than 475,000 small businesses in Florida have fewer than 20 employees, according to a 2025 report by the Small Business Administration. Not counting businesses without employees — of which there are more than 2 million — there are fewer than 518,000 total small businesses.
‘I just feel like we don’t need it…”
HB 197 faced slight pushback from Democrats on Wednesday. Rep. Angie Nixon, from Jacksonville, worried that demanding small business owners to implement E-Verify procedures could be “cumbersome,” especially for Floridians who may have started their practice “out of desperation.”
“I just feel like we don’t need it,” Nixon said. “It takes away from actually running the business.”
Although Nixon was joined by the three other Democrats on the committee in voting “no,” HB 197 will head next to the House Commerce Committee.
Immigration has become a major flashpoint nationally, led by President Donald Trump and mirrored by DeSantis in Florida political circles. Both conservative firebrands have encouraged massive upticks in detention and deportation, demonstrated by DeSantis supporting the construction of federally-partnered migrant detention centers and Trump mobilizing Border Patrol to supplant and aid Immigration and Customs Enforcement to expedite deportations.
In 2023, then-Senator Blaise Ingoglia sponsored the law to require private businesses with at least 25 employees to use E-Verify. It was part of a large immigration package that also required Medicaid-accepting hospitals to annually report how many undocumented immigrants they treat.
But ahead of the 2025 legislative session, months after Ingoglia’s E-Verify requirements were enacted, Florida Republicans began to criticize the DeSantis administration for failing to enforce the law for non-compliance. Statute requires businesses caught ignoring E-Verify laws three times within 2 years to face a $1,000 fine per day.
DeSantis then fired off warning letters to 40 companies either ignoring or refusing to implement E-Verify.

Brittney Reese, a seven-time world champion and Olympic golf medalist long jumper, headlines the 2026 Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame induction class announced at the MSHOF museum Wednesday.
Reese is joined by a talented and diverse group that includes three former football stars, the winningest college baseball coach in Mississippi history, a championship swimming and diving coach, and perhaps the most successful strength and conditioning coach in football history.
In alphabetical order, the MSHOF Class of 2026:

Glen Collins, a Jackson native and Mississippi State first team All American football star. One of the most decorated defensive linemen in Mississippi football history, Collins was a first round draft choice of the Cincinnati Bengals in 1982 and played seven years in the NFL. Collins played high school football at Jim Hill. At State, he was so dominant that opposing teams nearly always double-teamed him. He was one of the heroes of State’s memorable 6-3 victory over Alabama in 1980, which remains perhaps the most treasured victory in MSU football history.
Louis Guy, a two-way player, who was one of the heroes of the undefeated 1960 Ole Miss football team that was awarded the Football Writers of America national championship. Guy played wingback and defensive back and was a threat to score on either side of the football. He caught three touchdown passes in a game against Houston and returned a pass interception 100 yards for a touchdown in a victory over Tennessee. Guy was drafted in the third round of the NFL draft by the Philadelphia Eagles and later played for both the Philadelphia Eagles and Oakland Raiders. Following his playing days, he built a successful career as an orthodontist and Jackson community leader.
Michael Haddix, a two-time Mississippi State All-SEC running back from Walnut who was the eighth overall pick of the 1983 NFL draft by the Philadelphia Eagles. Haddix was one of those running backs with a rare blend of both speed and power, which he employed to gain six yards per carry for his entire State career, still a school record. “Just an unbelievably great back,” Collins said. “I know because I had to tackle him in practice. Michael was a great teammate and a great guy.. All us guys from that era of State football remain close.”
Bobby Halford, a Meridian native who was a terrific baseball player before becoming the head baseball coach at William Carey University where he has amassed more than 1,300 victories, surpassing Hall of Famer Ron Polk as the winningest college baseball coach in Mississippi history. He has led the Crusaders to 19 conference championships and 26 national tournament appearances. He was the NAIA National Coach of the Year in 2017.
Ronnie Mayer, former Delta State athletic director and before that the championship swimming and diving coach for the Cleveland school. Mayer’s teams won 11 Gulf South Conference titles and made 15 NCAA Championship appearances. Mayer recruited and coached 56 All Americans during his career – little wonder the Delta State aquatics center bears his name.
Johnny Parker, considered a pioneer in strength and conditioning, particularly in football. Parker coached for 35 years at the college and professional levels after beginning his career at Indianola Academy. His innovative training methods have influenced generations of coaches and athletes. He earned three Super Bowl rings as an NFL strength coach with the New York Giants and Tampa Bay Bucs.
Brittney Reese, a Gulfport native who has become one of the most decorated athletes in Mississippi history, male or female, in any sport. She starred in track and field and basketball at Gulfport High and Gulf Coast Community College before concentrating in track and field under Hall of Fame coach Joe Walker at Ole Miss where she was a two-time NCAA champion for the Rebels. She is a seven-time world champion who won the Olympic gold medal in 2012 and silver medals in 2016 and 2021. She is the latest in an amazing pantheon of Mississippi long jumping greats, including Hall of Famers Ralph Boston, Willye B. White, Larry Myricks and Savanté Stringfellow.

(Photo by Scott Eisen/Getty Images)Constitutional protections against unlawful detention or imprisonment don’t apply to a deported Brown Medicine kidney doctor seeking to come back to the United States, the federal judge reviewing her case has ruled.
U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin’s Oct. 31 order ends Alawieh’s legal case against the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agents who detained her when she returned to Boston’s Logan International Airport on March 13, deporting her back to her native Lebanon 36 hours later. She remains in Lebanon and has been banned from reentering the United States for five years.
Alawieh through her attorneys had asked the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts to declare her removal unconstitutional, and reinstate the work visa that would let her return to her job in Rhode Island.
Sorokin’s 14-page dismissal of the case leaves unaddressed the merits of federal authorities’ claims linking Alawieh, who is Muslim, to Islamist terrorist leaders. Instead, the Massachusetts judge said the court lacks the jurisdictional authority to grant Alawieh’s petition for a writ of habeas corpus because she’s no longer in U.S. custody.
“As the Court will explain, the relief Alawieh seeks in this action is beyond what this Court can provide,” Sorokin wrote, later characterizing the lawsuit as “mooted.”
He continued, “Nearly all challenges to denials of discretionary relief or determinations related to the inspection and expedited removal of noncitizens arriving at the border are beyond the jurisdiction of any federal court.”

Alawieh, 34, had lived, worked and studied in the U.S. since 2018 under a series of legal visas that gave her “express permission” to do so, Sorokin wrote. But, he also acknowledged the “parlous decision” she made in returning to Lebanon in February — her first visit back in seven years.
“Having chosen to travel abroad, Alawieh faced inspection by immigration officers when she returned from her trip,” Sorokin wrote. “Alawieh’s years spent living lawfully in this country would not immunize her from such inspection. Her possession of a visa would not alter the inspection requirement either, nor would it guarantee her admission when she presented herself at the border. Thus, Alawieh’s decision to travel to Lebanon carried with it some risk, as the outcome of the necessary inspection was not a certainty.”
It was during this inspection that customs officers detained Alawieh, questioning her and looking through her cell phone, where they allegedly found pictures of various Hezbollah leaders. Alawieh also told customs officials when questioned that she attended a funeral event for the Islamist group’s late leader, Hassan Nasrallah, according to court filings. 
The stadium event held in Beirut on Feb. 23 drew hundreds of thousands of attendees. 
Attorneys with Muslim Advocates and Marzouk Law LLC representing Alawieh in the lawsuit did not respond to multiple requests for comment Tuesday and Wednesday. However, Golnaz Fakhimi, legal director of Muslim Advocates, issued a statement to the Boston Globe on Monday, saying lawyers are assessing the judge’s decision and considering potential next steps.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Alawieh’s deportation sent shockwaves through Rhode Island’s medical community, prompting a protest outside the Rhode Island State House on the heels of her abrupt deportation in March. As one of three transplant nephrologists in Rhode Island, Alawieh provided life-saving care to patients who now have no doctor, according to court documents.
In addition to her job at Brown Medicine, the nonprofit, physician-led practice, which is affiliated with the Brown University Warren Alpert School of Medicine, Alawieh also had a clinical fellowship at Brown University, and consulted on cases out of Rhode Island Hospital, which is owned by Brown University Health.

City voters on Tuesday supported a 10-district voting system that has been used in two election cycles but was never codified in the city charter.
The victory means the process of formally including the system in the charter may go forward for state approval before Virginia Beach elections next year.
Unofficial returns show 53% of voters chose what is called a 10-1 system over a “modified” version of the city’s former 7-3-1 system.
The result could put the city closer to ending years of litigation and political wrangling about voting in City Council and School Board elections.
Virginia Beach voting system remains in limbo after Senate rejection

“The residents have spoken,” said Lisa Turner, a strategist for the groups organized to advocate for the 10-1 system. “They like their district reps and they’d like to continue seeing accountability on City Council and School Board. The 10-1 system provides all of the above.”
Georgia Allen, one of the plaintiffs in the federal suit, said the 10-1 system is better for all citizens.
“The reason why it is fairer is because it’s one person, one vote,” Allen said. “So one person, one vote, no matter what district you’re in, you all have equal representation.”
Under the 10-1 system, voters pick two of the 11 members of the council or school board. Each voter selects a representative for their own district and one citywide representative. On the council, that citywide representative is the mayor.
Before the 10-1 system was used in 2022, all city voters picked all members of local bodies, even representatives for districts in which they didn’t live. That’s no longer allowed by state law.
A modified 7-3-1 system would mean voters pick their own district representative among seven residency districts, as well as four “at-large,” or citywide, representatives. The mayor would be one of the citywide representatives for the City Council.
Supporters raised more than $630,000 for a referendum committee for the 7-3-1, saying it gives citizens the power to choose more representatives and greater influence over government decisions.
Voters could pick five members, rather than two under the 10-1 system.
Leaders associated with pro-7-3-1 organizations could not be reached for comment late Tuesday.
Linwood Branch is a former member of the City Council and the lead plaintiff in a state suit that challenged the city’s use of 10-1 voting. Last week, he said more citywide seats meant more leaders are responsible to more voters.
“Hopefully, we get some more at-large people that have a greater interest in the entire city and understand the ramifications of these decisions,” Branch said.

The narrow margin of victory could spur Cascadden or her backers to request a recount. However, Anna Sventek, communications director for the Secretary of State’s Office, told the Bulletin that as of Wednesday afternoon, the state had not yet received a request for one.
Tremblay is the Berlin police commissioner, who has a lengthy career in law enforcement, while Cascadden was Berlin’s school superintendent from 2009 to 2019 and currently serves as interim Littleton School District superintendent.
Tremblay emphasized public safety during his campaign, promising to stiffen bail laws — saying he wants to continue the work his Republican colleagues did in overturning bail reform earlier this year — and support local police departments. In the primary election in September, he beat out Johnathan Henson, 157-10, the Secretary of State’s Office reported.
The special election was called to replace Republican Brian Valerino, who resigned from the seat after Gov. Kelly Ayotte nominated him in May to be the warden for the Northern New Hampshire Correctional Facility in Berlin.
Meanwhile, another Republican state representative has resigned, setting up another House special election.

Oct. 9, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — An advisory group of University of Nebraska-Lincoln faculty, staff and students disagrees with the campus chancellor on whether to cut certain academic programs.
UNL’s 21-member Academic Planning Committee described its recommendations in an unsigned Oct. 24 letter to UNL Chancellor Rodney Bennett. It based its decisions on anonymous online votes because of potential “conflicts of interest” from some members directly affected by the budget proposal and others who worked with Bennett to create the list.
Among the major takeaways: The advisory committee called on Bennett to delay finding alternatives to cutting academic programs, which the group described as the “absolute last resort.”


Academic Planning Committee recommendations
Read the full advisory letter from the 21-member Academic Planning Committee to UNL Chancellor Rodney Bennett here. A list of committee members is available here.


In a month of reviewing Bennett’s proposal since it was unveiled Sept. 12, advisory members wrote that they had seen that faculty, staff, student and stakeholder “energy” can be “unleashed” on the budget and find “creative and selfless solutions.”
“We are confident that, had they been given time, the campus would have come together to find creative, positive ways to eliminate the structural deficit without proposed program eliminations,” the letter reads.
Bennett is seeking $27.5 million in total cuts — $21 million to close an ongoing “structural deficit” and $6.5 million meant to “help safeguard against repetitive budget reduction cycles.”
Advisory recommendations
A majority of members opposed eliminating four of six academic programs, a total of $7.7 million. The four programs with majority support account for $4.3 million. The committee voted nearly unanimously to merge four programs into two areas, anticipated to save $2 million. 
The programs merged would be the Departments of Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communication and the Departments of Plant Pathology and Entomology.
By an 11-9 vote, the committee supported $550,000 in less funding for graduate teaching assistants in UNL’s two largest colleges. Some committee members said they hesitantly preferred that reduction over further program cuts, according to the letter. The committee hosted livestreamed hearings into each academic area slated for reductions, which allowed select department representatives and alumni to defend the areas.
Faculty question need for $27.5 million in cuts after report finds UNL ‘financially healthy’

One of the major proposed alternatives is to merge all four areas in the College of Architecture into “one unit” — architecture, interior design, community and regional planning and landscape architecture. The last two had been slated for cuts. The committee voted 19-2 in favor of both architectural programs citing the suggested alternative, which had the backing of the college dean. The dean is also a representative on the advisory committee.
Of other proposed areas for elimination, various alternatives had been suggested:

Increasing collaboration across NU to save the Department of Educational Administration (committee supported elimination 11-10).
Realigning UNL’s Department of Textiles, Merchandising and Fashion Design to be part of the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts (committee supported elimination 12-9). 
Merging the Statistics Department with the Mathematics Department to create a “Division of Quantitative and Data Sciences” (committee opposed elimination 13-8).
Merging the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, with expertise in geology, meteorology and climinate science, with the School of Natural Resources (committee opposed elimination 11-9).

The committee said most of the academic cuts might take at least 14 months to implement, so a delay would give units “a real opportunity” to find cost savings or new revenue streams.
Letter released after all
UNL initially opposed releasing the committee recommendations, Leslie Reed, a UNL spokesperson, said the morning of Oct. 24. She said the group’s recommendations would not be released until Bennett had reviewed them and offered his final proposal to the University of Nebraska Board of Regents. 
The regents are set to consider UNL’s proposal alongside other campus budget reductions during a Dec. 5 meeting.
The Nebraska Examiner filed a public records request immediately after talking with Reed. Four business days later, around noon on Oct. 30, an NU official coordinating the request said a response would be delayed by one day “in light of necessary response efforts.” State law requires a response within four business days.
Bennett then emailed the advisory letter to faculty and staff around 4:15 p.m. Oct. 31. About 30 minutes later, officials sent the same information to the Examiner, plus a single email exchange between the committee chair and Bennett. The committee provided its recommendation letter, as well as a “voluminous” collection of public responses to the cuts.

In total, the committee received nearly 3,000 unique comments. The collection is public record and should be available by the end of the week, an NU official said.
Asked why the change in releasing the recommendations, Reed said UNL leadership reversed course after “additional consideration and consultation” and “in the interest of full transparency.”
Decision expected in ‘coming weeks’
In his Oct. 31 recommendations release, Bennett thanked the committee for its “thoughtful work” as well as the thousands of faculty, staff, students and stakeholders who had gotten involved. He called their engagement “essential.”
Bennett, who can take or leave the group’s recommendations, said he was “carefully reviewing” the work and would continue consulting “shared governance partners” before finalizing a budget reduction plan. 
He said he expects to finalize the plan in the “coming weeks.” Only the regents can ultimately approve academic cuts.
“Thank you for your continued commitment to our university and to one another as we move forward together,” Bennett wrote.
‘We do not have a spending problem’
Asked about the advisory committee’s suggested delay in academic program cuts, Reed said the $27.5 million includes cuts for the current fiscal year, which would be half over by the end of December. Said Reed: “Longer delays worsen the university’s cash position.”

In addition to the programmatic cuts, Bennett has proposed cutting $17.25 million through administrative “efficiencies,” targeted philanthropy to fund state-aided scholarships, a 1% reduction in all state-aided budgets and a voluntary early retirement program for long-time tenured faculty.
UNL has not disclosed how many faculty applied for and might ultimately be accepted from UNL’s voluntary buy-out program. It anticipates $5.5 million in savings.
Should the administrative changes remain unchanged and Bennett proceed with the items that received majority support from the advisory group, UNL would trim its budget by $23.2 million. If the university eliminates no programs, it would cut just under $20 million.
In general, the committee echoed comments from top UNL and NU leaders that UNL is struggling because of slowing state investments, to the tune of more than $200 million in recent years when adjusted for inflation. The shift has been clearest over the past few years under Gov. Jim Pillen, a former regent of 10 years who became governor in 2023.
“We do not have a spending problem on this campus: We have an investment problem,” the advisory committee letter reads.
The committee expressed concern that more than $75 million has been cut over the past six years and voiced worry that without investment, UNL might struggle to remain a top research university or even a member of the Big Ten Conference, which helps steer academic research dollars and athletics funding.
New set of data
Many of the academic program eliminations resulted from a new data analysis conducted by Bennett and other administrators that sought to quantify department contributions. A separate qualitative analysis was also conducted, though those results have not been released.
In the past, college deans were given financial reduction amounts and asked to find ways to hit the target. The advisory committee said the metrics-based approach had been confidentially shared with deans and the committee in the spring, but “no one was able to fully validate the metrics, either through confirming the accuracy of the underlying data or via analysis to confirm that the metrics were statistically valid ways to quantify the desired performance indicators.”
Should metrics be used again, the committee said it needed to be refined and allow departments to propose alternative data that might better capture contributions to UNL.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Even in a short time, committee members worked toward a “humane, comprehensive review” of their own, the letter said. While a metrics-based approach might be helpful, the committee said, the latest analysis didn’t accurately reflect all units’ missions.
For example, the committee said the analysis didn’t capture extension work in the community, compared units from different areas and was biased toward larger units.
UNL Executive Vice Chancellor Mark Button, UNL’s top academic officer, said officials are mindful that “data can’t tell you everything.” The “holistic” qualitative analysis included general trends, insight into workforce development and the integration of artificial intelligence or other new growth areas in research and teaching. Button is also a member of the advisory committee.
“The metrics will never be the sum total of it, but I think it will continue to be an important part about how we track our progress as an institution going forward,” Button said in September.
‘Mission critical’
For years, NU has discussed a long-term goal to seek readmission to the Association of American Universities, a prestigious national organization that UNL, a founding member, was voted out of in 2011. 
The advisory group said that the AAU goal is “not necessarily well-aligned” with the responsibilities of a land-grant university meant to give back to Nebraska, such as in agriculture. Even so, some departments proposed for cuts rank high by AAU standards yet were proposed for elimination.
The committee said UNL administrators must be able to say that anything left after cuts is more “critical” to UNL’s mission than any of the proposed academic program cuts.
“We therefore urge you to consider whether this is absolutely the case,” the letter reads, “or whether alternative cuts could allow us to preserve these mission-critical academic programs.”

Shelly Hutchinson are headed to a December runoff after neither managed to clinch over half of the vote in a three-way race that overlapped with other statewide and municipal elections. 
Hutchinson, a Snellville Democrat who has held the seat since 2019, stepped down from the state Legislature earlier this year to care for a family member. Over 8,000 voters cast ballots in Tuesday’s special election to replace her, with the two top candidates, Democrats Marqus Cole and Muhammad Akbar Ali, earning 39% and 32% of the vote, respectively. They will face off again next month in a runoff election to represent Georgia’s 106th House district, which encompasses a southwestern portion of Gwinnett County.

Republican Jamie Parker came in third with 29% of the vote, according to unofficial results from the secretary of state’s website. His campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
Cole, who emerged as the frontrunner in the race, serves as organizing director at Georgia Interfaith Power and Light, an energy and environmental nonprofit. He centered his campaign around issues like health care access, housing affordability and education, and received endorsements from state Sen. Nikki Merritt, a Grayson Democrat, and Gwinnett Solicitor General Lisamarie Bristol. 
Merritt, a three-term state senator whose district overlaps with House District 106, also helped Cole campaign.
“I am very excited to be supporting Marcus,” Merritt said in a video posted to Instagram, adding that she had known him since she took office five years ago. “When I look for a candidate, I am looking for someone who I know is ready to get to work on day one and is going to be a good representative for this district. I can attest to Marcus in the work that he’s done in his community.”
In a statement on election night, Cole expressed optimism about the runoff election.
“I’m grateful that the voters have chosen to move our campaign forward to the runoff election,” he said. “Winning the early vote, election day vote and a clear majority of the polling locations sends a very clear message and I’m here to continue the fight.”
Ali, the former first vice chair of the Gwinnett County Democratic Party and a recent graduate of Kennesaw State University, finished in second place. Though he has been the most prolific fundraiser in the race, with over $31,000 raised, Ali trailed Cole in several precincts on election day. (By comparison, Parker reported raising $5,200 during the most recent filing period, and Cole has raised $4,200.)
At 21, Ali would become the youngest state legislator currently serving in Georgia if elected. Susan Powell, a Gwinnett County resident, said she voted for Ali in part because of his youth.
“I think we need more young people in our government,” she said. “It’s made up of way too many — no offense — old white men.”
Ali’s campaign centers on lowering the cost of living, supporting public schools and protecting the rights of immigrants and LGBTQ Georgians. He also received endorsements from Hutchinson, former Georgia Governor Roy Barnes and Gwinnett County Commissioner Kirkland Carden.
In an election night statement, Ali said his campaign would be hard at work over the next few weeks to build momentum with voters.
“I am honored and humbled to have earned a spot in the runoff as a first-time candidate,” he said in a statement.
“If I earned your support in today’s election, thank you, if you still were not able to participate in the election, I hope you make a plan to vote in the runoff, and if you voted for another candidate, know that my door is open to you and I will be working hard to earn the support of everyone in this community,” he added.
The runoff election between Ali and Cole will be held on Dec. 2.

(Photo courtesy of UPS)The United States gained 42,000 jobs in October, the first increase since July as measured by ADP, a private payroll processing company and the only source of jobs estimates during the government shutdown, as federal jobs reports have been paused.
ADP’s report, released Wednesday, showed job increases mostly in West Coast states, which gained 37,000 jobs between September and October, and continued job losses on the East Coast. The New York area, including New Jersey and Pennsylvania, lost 20,000 jobs while coastal states from Delaware to Florida lost 8,000 jobs.
Most of the job increases were in trade and transportation, which includes stores, wholesale and shipping jobs. In that sector, there were 47,000 new jobs for the month.
Those industries added jobs despite uncertainty over tariffs, said Guy Berger, a labor economist and senior fellow at the Burning Glass Institute, a labor market think tank based in Philadelphia. But Berger said it’s unclear whether the job gains will be long lasting or will disappear in new rounds of high tariffs on consumer goods.
“They’re feeling headwinds but they’re very ping-pongy, It’s like, ‘Who knows what the next bit of news will be or how you’re going to have to adjust your supply?’” Berger said.
“In years past this would have been considered quite weak, but the number was positive at least,” Berger said. “Because immigration flows have been squeezed during the current administration and maybe have even gone negative at this point, we don’t need a lot of jobs each month to keep the labor market on an even keel.”
Economists say job losses likely, even as shutdown delays report

The ADP report is based on weekly payroll data for 26 million private-sector employees. It does not include an estimate of the unemployment rate, unlike the suspended federal report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It also does not break down the statistics by race or gender.
States begin to see job losses from Trump’s cuts, housing and spending slowdowns

Last month’s job gains were concentrated in large businesses with more than 500 employees, which gained 70,000 jobs for the month, while jobs dropped overall for small and medium-size businesses, according to the report.
The median annual pay growth was 4.5% for those in the same jobs and 6.7% for those in new jobs, the same as September and little changed for more than a year, the report said, indicating that “shifts in supply and demand are balanced.”

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)North Carolina’s attorney general has joined a multi-state lawsuit against FEMA and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, accusing the agencies of withholding grant money that states use to pay emergency workers and fund disaster preparation.
The suit, filed in Oregon federal court, alleges that the Trump administration has placed new, unlawful restrictions on grant programs that are “functionally defunding state and local police agencies and emergency response personnel.”  Those other states suing include Michigan, Arizona, Kentucky, Maryland and Wisconsin.
North Carolina receives around $17 million from the program to train emergency personnel, coordinate rescue operations and conduct other law enforcement exercises, Jackson’s office said.
“Our emergency management and first responder teams worked around the clock in the weeks following Hurricane Helene, and these funds were critical to their work,” said Attorney General Jeff Jackson. “We’re in hurricane season right now, and without these funds, we’ll be left with fewer resources to help people during the next storm that hits North Carolina.”

FEMA’s new guidance on the grant program requires states to submit a 2025 population estimate that excludes undocumented immigrants deported under the administration. And the agency also shortened the time window for the completion of grant-reimbursable activities from three years to one year.
The states argue those new guidelines are both overly burdensome and beyond the federal government’s reach to impose.
“[The guidance] is unexplained, does not reflect reasoned decision making, and ignores the states’ reliance…on receipt of the [grant] funds unimpeded,” the suit says.

Bills could rise $17 to $20.,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/05/pura-yankee-gas-rate-hike/,"The decision comes in response to the company's request for a nearly 27% increase in revenues. Instead, PURA approved closer to 11%.","Connecticut utility regulators approved a rate increase for the Yankee Gas Company on Wednesday, just ahead of the winter heating season. 
The decision comes in response to Yankee Gas’ request last year for a nearly 27% increase in its allowed revenues, the largest such request for a Connecticut gas company in two decades.
Instead, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority voted to allow the company to collect up to $802 million a year in revenues, which amounts to an increase of around 11% or $82 million over its currently authorized revenues. Those revenues will be collected through new distribution rates that will take effect retroactively to Nov. 1.
The increase incorporates PURA’s decision to offer customers a $40 million refund from the company’s sale of excess pipeline capacity onto the market. That refund will be reflected in rates over the next three years, according to the decision.
The decision does not impact supply rates, which are a separate component of customers’ bills.
A spokeswoman for Eversource, which owns Yankee Gas, said Wednesday that the company was reviewing the decision.
The decision will result in an increase of between $17 and $20 a month in the average residential customer’s bill, according to an analysis by the Office of Consumer Counsel, which advocates on behalf of ratepayers.
In a statement Wednesday, Consumer Counsel Claire Coleman said that while PURA’s decision was “more generous” to the company than what her office proposed, it still amounted to less than half of increase Yankee Gas originally sought.
“This ask was simply too high to be palatable given the economic realities faced by the customers Yankee Gas serves,” Coleman said. “While my team and I are still reviewing today’s decision, it appears that PURA correctly reduced the company’s increase to about $82 million dollars and ordered an appropriate return on equity reduction.”
The decision follows another rate case last week in which PURA voted to allow a $66 million rate hike for customers of electric utility United Illuminating. In both cases, regulators voted to allow the utilities more revenues than had been originally proposed in draft decisions developed under PURA’s former chair, Marissa Gillett.
Gillett announced she was stepping down in September following a protracted series of legal and political disputes involving utility companies, which had accused her of violating open-records laws and wielding unilateral control over the authority. Her resignation took effect on Oct. 10. 
Attorney General William Tong referenced Gillett’s departure in a statement Wednesday calling PURA’s decision “disappointing” for families heading into winter. 
“Once again, the utilities are being rewarded with a multi-million dollar rate hike after running their chief regulator out of town through relentless litigation and personal attacks,” Tong said. “These costs are unsustainable and I’m going to keep pushing back in every single one of these rate cases to make sure Connecticut families aren’t paying a penny more than absolutely necessary.”
Gillett’s successor at the helm of PURA, Thomas Wiehl, recused himself from the Yankee Gas case Wednesday as he had previously submitted testimony in the case while working as a staff attorney for OCC. Two other recently appointed commissioners, Janice Beecher and Holly Cheeseman, also did not participate in the vote, citing the limited amount of time they had to review the voluminous records.
Those recusals left PURA down to just two participating members on Wednesday: Vice Chair David Arconti and Commissioner Michael Caron. Both voted in favor of the final decision.
“We tried to find a fair balance between all the parties, not the least of which is our ratepayers,” Caron said in brief remarks before the vote. “I believe that we have come to a final decision that provides revenue that is sufficient enough to prudently manage the gas distribution system.”
The decision also marked the first fully adjudicated rate case for Yankee Gas since 2011. The company’s current distribution rates were determined by a settlement agreement reached in 2017.

Jennifer and Dean Bye were just getting by before Hurricane Ida slammed into southern Louisiana in 2021. The couple own a house in a comfortable subdivision in Paulina, a town about an hour west of New Orleans, that they share with their three kids. They had their challenges before the storm — Jennifer had recently been diagnosed with uterine cancer around the same time that one of their children was diagnosed with nonverbal autism — but the Byes were making it work. Then Ida turned everything upside down.
“The living room fell in and everything had to be gutted,” Jennifer, a nursing assistant, said. “We lost everything we owned.”
After pummeling the Caribbean, Hurricane Ida made its U.S. landfall on August 29. The storm had evolved from a Category 1 into a Category 4 in the span of just 24 hours, a rapid intensification powered in part by unusually hot seawater in the Gulf of Mexico. It dumped a foot of rain on Louisiana and meandered north, blowing through 17 states before it reentered the Atlantic Ocean north of Maine. The storm, one of the strongest to hit Louisiana on record, left a trail of devastation in its wake: More than 100 people died and economic losses totalled $75 billion.
Four years later, the Byes are still living in a damaged house. Patches of tattered plywood siding are exposed to the elements. Inside, the windowsills are blackened with mildew. The kids play in a stripped living room, bare cement and grout underfoot. Fast-food wrappers and trash mingle with packing boxes and pulled-up carpet. The other houses in the neighborhood are manicured, but the Byes’ house is still a wreck.
On paper, the family did everything right. They had homeowners insurance through an A+ rated, Better Business Bureau-accredited insurer called FedNat Insurance Co. and kept up with their payments — some of the highest in the country.
What they didn’t account for was what might happen if their insurance company couldn’t make its payments.

In recent years, extreme weather events supercharged by climate change have revealed how fragile the country’s property insurance landscape is — and how quickly insurance companies can go from profitable to nonexistent. In the five years between 2018 and 2023, more than 1.9 million home insurance policies were dropped in disaster-prone states like Florida, Louisiana, California, and Texas by insurance companies that either voluntarily withdrew from those states or went bankrupt. FedNat was one of seven Florida-based property insurers to go bankrupt during 2021 and 2022 due to insurmountable financial troubles. In Louisiana, 11 insurance companies were declared insolvent between 2021 and 2022.
The resulting scramble to secure insurance in high-risk areas often means homeowners face a daunting choice: high premiums in a private market that is loath to insure them, or limited coverage through state-mandated insurance programs that can cost just as much or more.
“How do you do that to people?” Bye asked. “How do you insure people in the South, take all of these premiums, and then just belly-up?”

The insurance business has always been cyclical, rocking between boom periods of profitability and bust periods of huge losses driven by disasters and homeowner lawsuits. But as the planet heats up, the business of risk is undergoing a period of rapid evolution. FedNat’s quick demise is emblematic not just of an industry ill-prepared for the consequences of climate change, but also of a new era for the country’s insurance markets — one where state systems designed to keep companies in the black and shield homeowners from catastrophe are failing cyclically in both regards.
“We are in the era of polycrisis,” said Daniel Aldrich, director of the Resilience Studies Program at Northeastern University, “which is a fancy way of saying the number of disasters and their impact are both increasing and the time between shocks is decreasing, therefore government institutions, insurance companies, and homeowners can’t keep up.”
In 2019, FedNat acquired Maison Insurance, a company with operations in Louisiana and Texas. It proceeded to become one of the biggest property insurers in Louisiana. But its fortunes took a turn less than a year later, when four hurricanes hit the South in the span of about two months, followed by a deadly winter storm that burst pipes and flooded homes in early 2021.
Later that year, as FedNat faced more than $100 million in net losses, a figure that included the claim filed by the Byes, the company abruptly announced it was dropping all of its policies outside of its home base of Florida. Some 13,500 homeowners in Louisiana were suddenly forced to scramble for insurance. Reorienting to focus exclusively on Florida, FedNat’s CEO said, would result “in a financially stronger company.”
Those assurances proved premature.

Six months later, in the spring of 2022, FedNat, hat in its hands, asked Florida insurance regulators to allow it to cancel more than 56,000 in-state policies. It’s unlikely that state regulators would have permitted such a move in normal times, but their hands were tied: Three Florida-based insurers had already folded in the first half of that year, and the state couldn’t afford another insurance bankruptcy. So the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation let FedNat cancel thousands of policies, an “extraordinary statutory remedy,” in a desperate bid to stabilize its market. The state’s gamble didn’t pay off.
Even though FedNat had raised its rates by 70 percent over the preceding five years, the company admitted it had “overstated its cash positions” in the fall of 2022 and was placed into liquidation by the state.
Before it went bankrupt, FedNat transferred tens of thousands of policies to one of its Florida affiliates, Monarch Insurance, and closed on a $15 million investment deal with a company called Hale Partnership Capital Management, a move that made Hale the majority owner in Monarch. “[We’re] hungry,” Hale’s CEO said in 2023, eyeing an expansion.
FedNat’s evolution between 2021 and 2022 mirrors a pattern that outside experts have seen repeated in recent years — one that results in new mergers and lucrative payouts for executives, and spells disaster for homeowners.
“By declaring bankruptcy, [insurance companies] can force policyowners and reinsurance companies to take a ‘haircut’ — meaning take less money than they were promised initially,” said Aldrich. “Some of those assets then are reabsorbed into a new company, some can be sold off, and some of the policies that are still productive, maybe they’ll keep those, like if they’re in very low-risk areas.”
People like the Byes, forced to navigate the legal process of fighting for an insurance payout while simultaneously trying to find another company willing to insure them, end up getting caught in the crosshairs.

In 2022, the Byes hired lawyers to fight for what they were owed from FedNat. When FedNat officially entered into bankruptcy, their litigation, alongside approximately 1,500 other open claims, was inherited by the Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Association, or LIGA, a state-backed corporation that assumes outstanding claims from failed insurance companies licensed in Louisiana. But the pace of climate-intensified disasters has also overwhelmed LIGA, which is meant to serve as a safety net for people left in the lurch like the Byes.
While waiting on LIGA to settle their claim, Dean called 68 insurance companies before one, Allstate, agreed to write him a homeowner’s policy for $3,900. That annual premium payment is now closer to $5,000, Dean, who recently retired from working as an emergency medical technician, said. He’s tried to switch to a cheaper plan since. “Nobody is writing,” he said. “Still, to this day, nobody is writing.”
The Byes received some money from FedNat before the company went bankrupt, checks that totaled less than $90,000, Dean said, barely enough to make a dent in the damage. As of this month — more than four years after the hurricane that nearly destroyed their home — the couple said they are still waiting on $450,000 from LIGA. LIGA’s latest annual report shows more than 500 FedNat claims are still pending. The guaranty association is managing a backlog of leftover claims — not just from FedNat, but also the many other insurance companies that have gone bankrupt in recent years. LIGA did not reply to Grist’s request for comment, nor did Hale Partnership Capital Management.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The Byes were fortunate to find at least one private insurance company that would write them a policy. But for many others in a similar position, the only viable alternative is what’s known as an “insurance plan of last resort” — that is, state-mandated programs that insure people and businesses that can’t get policies through the private market.
Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plans, or FAIR plans, operate in 36 states and typically have high premiums, strict requirements, and offer limited coverage. That’s by design: Authorized by states in the 1960s and funded by private insurance companies as a prerequisite for doing business, the plans are supposed to serve as a backstop for Americans in the riskiest parts of the country.
But as more of the nation becomes high-risk and private insurance companies pull back, waves of people are being forced on and off these state-sponsored plans.

“I just got an email from my homeowners insurance broker that the only thing I can do is go with Citizens which is the state run insurance which is very expensive and not particularly good insurance,” someone in Florida posted on Facebook in 2022.
Another person posted, “Anyone who has had [United Property & Casualty] or another insurance company that … went bankrupt after Ian had any luck obtaining a new policy with another company? As of right now heading into hurricane season, I was informed by [an] insurance brokerage that no company will insure me.”
The question of what to do with the growing number of people who have been shunted onto their state FAIR plans by insurance companies that have gone bankrupt or withdrawn from states in recent years is becoming a major headache for public officials across the U.S. In California, there are 625,000 residential dwellings on the state’s last-resort plan as of this September — a 167 percent increase since 2021. In Louisiana, the number of residential properties on the state plan nearly tripled between 2021 and 2023. In Florida, the state-backed insurance plan of last resort took on around 800,000 new policies between 2019 and 2023.
Alfonso Pating, a global financial regulation analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council and the author of a recent report on state FAIR plans, calls this the “cycle of doom.”
Here’s how it works: Private insurers go bankrupt or withdraw from risky areas, and dropped property owners are shunted onto their state FAIR plans. Those properties flood or burn down, depleting the FAIR plan’s coffers, and then the program imposes fresh charges on private insurers or homeowners, or both, to replenish its reserves. Insurance companies try to pass some of those costs onto all policyholders in that state, driving up the cost of insurance for everyone. Overall, the insurance business consequently becomes less profitable for private insurers, resulting in more of them leaving the state and more people ending up on FAIR.
That’s the problem in a nutshell, said Pating. “FAIR programs aren’t meant to be a long-term solution,” he said.
There are ways to exit the doom vortex. One is to reform FAIR. When these state programs have a surplus, meaning they earn more money than they pay out in a given year, they typically disburse those funds back to the private insurance companies that pay into the plan. Instead, Pating said, FAIR plans could use that money to provide subsidies for low-income homeowners in high-risk areas who want to make their homes more resilient but can’t afford to. They could offer voluntary relocation assistance to move people out of areas that are guaranteed to keep flooding and burning. The plans could even offer group insurance to communities that want to take on big climate adaptation projects, such as prescribed burns to reduce the risk of wildfire, to help protect an entire neighborhood or cul-de-sac.
The most effective offramp, said Aldrich, from Northeastern, is building disaster preparedness into zoning from the ground up, which would require state legislators to pass laws banning new development in high-risk areas and mandate that homeowners take steps to protect their homes from wildfires, floods, and other hazards. But real estate lobbies in many states have stifled that kind of legislation, making it politically risky for politicians to support laws constricting new development.
As a result, counties at high risk of extreme weather across the United States have seen an influx of new residents in recent years, while low-risk counties have seen an exodus. It’s clear to researchers like Pating and Aldrich, and indeed to many insurers, that that trend is moving in the wrong direction and that politicians will need to step in to both harden existing housing stock against climate change and to prevent the pool of high-risk homes from getting larger.

In Louisiana and Florida, however, state lawmakers have taken a different approach to reform — one that critics say is more focused on insurance companies than homeowners. In Florida, new legislation that requires companies to pay out insurance claims faster also shields those companies from expensive lawsuits (though the state did resurrect a home-hardening policy this year to help homeowners protect their properties from wind damage). In Louisiana, policymakers repealed a “three-year rule” implemented after Hurricane Katrina that prevented insurers from canceling or not renewing policies that have been in effect for more than three years, and they greenlit a $45 million incentive program to encourage companies to write property insurance policies in the state.
The reforms have succeeded in attracting new insurers to both states. Louisiana has licensed 15 new insurance companies since 2024. In Florida, 17 new insurers have entered the market — including Viceroy Preferred Insurance, a company started by Hale Partnership Capital Management, the firm that bought Monarch from FedNat. Louisiana and Florida have begun “depopulating” their state insurance plans of last resort in response to the influx of new private insurers, forcing tens of thousands of homeowners back off the state-backed plans into a market regulators say is now stable.
“Since the passage of historic reforms, Florida’s property insurance market has experienced record growth and stability,” Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation wrote last month, celebrating its success and noting that the state had the “lowest average homeowners rate increase in the nation in 2024″ — a year when two back-to-back hurricanes hit the state.
Then again, it’s been an unusually quiet Atlantic hurricane season for the U.S. — the first time in 10 years that no hurricane has hit the country. The real test of resiliency for the Southeast’s insurance market won’t come down to how many new insurers states have attracted, it will be how many of those insurers will stay standing after repeat hits. Perhaps just as importantly, it will hinge on what percentage of homeowners in those states have been incentivized to adapt to bigger storms or encouraged to move out of harm’s way.
And that, Aldrich said, comes down to lawmakers’ willingness to take steps that may be politically painful in the short run. “This is not a new story for civilization,” he said. “We do not want to start imposing costs that would actually make society more effective and more resilient to these kinds of disasters.” The end result, however, is more expensive insurance for everyone.

The takeaway from last night was simply unmistakable.” Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both New York Democrats, sent a Wednesday letter to President Donald Trump, calling for a bipartisan meeting at the White House to end the government shutdown and to address the spike in individual health care premiums.“Last night, Republicans felt political repercussions,” Schumer said after Tuesday’s Election Day wins for Democrats. They included passage of a redistricting measure in California to offset partisan gerrymandering by GOP states, governorships in New Jersey and Virginia and local races across the country.For more than a month, Democrats have voted against approving the House-passed GOP stopgap spending measure over concerns that health care tax subsidies will expire at the end of the year. As open enrollment begins, people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace are seeing a drastic increase in premium costs. Sanders pushes back on dealmakingSchumer did not detail what kind of deal Democrats would accept, but said any negotiation “must address the health care needs of the American people.”However, independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said that Democrats should not accept any agreement with the GOP unless there is a commitment from House Speaker Mike Johnson and the president to pass legislation to extend those tax credits.“Bottom line is, we need to be successful in protecting the health care of the American people, and if it's just a piece of legislation that passes the Senate ... so what? Where does it go? Then it becomes just a meaningless gesture,” Sanders said. Republicans have maintained that they will only have a discussion on health care after Democrats agree to resume government funding. This week, the Senate failed for the 14th time to pass a stopgap spending measure that would fund the government until Nov. 21. Lawmakers have acknowledged that a new stopgap spending bill will need to be extended past the Nov. 21 deadline, but have not come to an agreement on a new deadline.Thune plays down Democratic victoriesSenate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Wednesday that he was skeptical the government shutdown played into major wins for Democrats across the country. “The shutdown doesn't benefit anyone,” he said.The South Dakota Republican noted the shutdown may have played a role in suburban Virginia, where a large share of federal workers live and are furloughed due to the government shutdown.“In Northern Virginia, that has a lot of federal workers, so it certainly could have been a factor in the elections,” Thune said. “But I think it's hard to draw conclusions.”But Thune said he’s focused on ending the government shutdown, and hopes progress can continue to be made before senators are scheduled to be out next week for recess due to the Veterans Day holiday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy this week warned that if the shutdown continues into next week, it could lead to certain airspace needing to be closed due to a shortage of air traffic controllers who have continued to work amid the shutdown.Trump, in a social media post, blamed two factors for Republicans not performing well on Tuesday: his absence from the ballot, and the government shutdown.“I think if you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans, and that was a big factor, and they say that I wasn't on the ballot was the biggest factor,” Trump said during a Wednesday press conference.Withholding SNAP benefitsAs the government shutdown has continued, the Trump administration has tried to get Senate Democrats to agree to the stopgap spending measure by directing the U.S. Department of Agriculture to not tap into its contingency fund to provide food assistance to 42 million people.Two federal courts found that the Trump administration acted unlawfully in holding back those Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits, and USDA agreed that it would partially release SNAP benefits. Trump earlier this week wrote on his social media platform that SNAP benefits would only be released when Democrats vote to reopen the government, a move that would likely violate the two court orders.“SNAP BENEFITS, which increased by Billions and Billions of Dollars (MANY FOLD!) during Crooked Joe Biden’s disastrous term in office (Due to the fact that they were haphazardly ‘handed’ to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need, which is the purpose of SNAP!), will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!,” he wrote.However, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt seemed to walk back that statement on Tuesday, arguing that the president’s social media post did not refer to the court order, but to future SNAP payments.“The president doesn't want to tap into this (contingency) fund in the future and that’s what he was referring to,” Leavitt said.",,,,2025-11-05 14:56:48.394166

(Courtesy Montana FWP)Montana’s tourism industry heavily favors the western half of the state, anchored by mountainous gateway communities surrounding Glacier and Yellowstone national parks. But while many travelers to Montana pass through huge swaths of the state en route to myriad destinations, there has been a data gap in understanding the impact of the tourism industry to the eastern half of Montana. 
A new study published by the University of Montana’s Institute for Tourism and Recreation Research starts filling in that gap, with a five-year look at county and regional-level visitation statistics that created a detailed picture of how out-of-state visitors interact and experience with eastern communities. 
The comprehensive report, published this week, showed that from 2018 to 2023, drive-through visitation in eastern Montana rose by just 3%, but lodging tax revenue increased by 44% and nonresident spending more than doubled to $1.1 billion.
The study compares visitor trends in 2018 and 2023, following a state-sponsored push to boost tourism and economic development in the region, and shows communities within the state’s 23 eastern counties saw huge increases in visitors and nonresident spending.
Historical sites, such as Pompeys Pillar and Little Bighorn Battlefield, and recreation destinations including Fort Peck Lake and state parks, emerged as top attractions in a portion of the state bereft of national-profile destinations. 
“As new efforts are introduced to showcase a broader range of visitor opportunities — highlighting Montana’s diverse attractions, including its historical, cultural, and natural treasures beyond the iconic national parks — this report illustrates how visitor patterns and spending in eastern Montana are evolving over time,” said Melissa Weddell, director of ITRR. “This report is a strong example of how we can use current nonresident survey data to take a closer look at statewide initiatives, economic trends, and residents’ perspectives.”

 Eastern Montana Initiative

The Institute for Tourism and Recreation Research conducts annual surveys of  nonresident visitors to Montana. The more than 13 million tourists to the state spend nearly $5.5 billion annually, supporting more than 66,000 jobs and driving one of the state’s biggest industries. 
But the majority of that spending, and visitation, is concentrated in the Glacier Country and Yellowstone Country tourism regions, at $1.76 and $1.3 billion respectively. The state’s Missouri River Country region and the Southeast combined for less than $1 billion in visitor spending during the last two years. 
But following a larger focus from government and tourism focused groups, post-pandemic trends and record-breaking numbers at the state’s most popular sites, Glacier and Yellowstone national parks, the eastern regions of the state have more than doubled the nonresident spending since 2018.
In 2019, the Montana Department of Commerce’s State Tourism Office launched an Eastern Montana Initiative with a focus on bolstering tourism and economic development in “historically under-visited” parts of Montana. 
The initiative was developed in response to declining bed tax revenues in Eastern Montana and with an aim at reducing overcrowding seen in western regions and national parks during peak tourism seasons. By providing grant funding to communities, the initiative sought to highlight eastern Montana’s unique landscapes, historical and cultural sites, and recreational opportunities, such as Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area, which drew 5% of the region’s visitors.

In response, the Institute for Tourism Research launched its own parallel initiative to increase data collection across the eastern counties. From 2017 to 2019, surveyors with the institute nearly tripled the number of nonresident visitors they interacted with.
“This project seeks to uncover and analyze visitor characteristics and community trends in Eastern Montana over the past five years,” the ITRR report states, with a goal of providing “insights for stakeholders and policymakers to support sustainable economic development.”
Taking the state’s easternmost 23 counties, beginning with Blaine, Fergus, Musselshell, Yellowstone and Big Horn, researchers subdivided eastern Montana into five initiative zones — northwest, northeast, central, south, and Yellowstone County. 
Chart via ITRR
Visitation levels in 2018, before the Eastern Montana Initiative began, were approximately 4.8 million annually. During the five years of the study period, overall visitation grew by about 142,000, or 3%. 
However, when researchers looked at the zones within the region, they saw significant growth everywhere but Yellowstone County, indicating that visitors passing through eastern Montana are stopping in more areas, seeing more travel destinations, and spending more in each sub-region. 
“That growth — especially without major investment — shows real resilience and opportunity,” Weddell told the Daily Montanan. “What’s happening in Eastern Montana is a success story.”
The northeast zone, comprising Valley, Daniels, Sheridan, Roosevelt and Richland counties, saw a 68% increase in visitors by 2023. The northwest zone saw a 31% increase, followed by the central zone at 25% and south zone at 20%.
Yellowstone County saw a 5% decrease in visitors — further evidence that travelers are shifting their visitation habits outside the main population center.
Chart via ITRR
In tandem with visitor increases, spending by nonresidents also saw a huge boost — by nearly 82% over the entire region.
The central zone saw a 200% increase in spending, the northwest saw a 106% increase in spending and at the low end, Yellowstone County saw a nearly 40% increase in tourism spending
The largest spending category across all regions was transportation, which includes fuel, with sales of $499 million. The spending category with the most growth was shopping retail, and specifically “Made in Montana” branded goods, which increased from $60 million in 2018 to $132 million in 2023. 
While the statewide initiative helped provide some money, the state’s regional nonprofit tourism boards have a heavy hand in promoting the counties under their umbrella as travel destinations. 
“We have always felt that eastern Montana, and specifically northeastern Montana, has always felt like the red-headed step child,” Ray Trumpower, board chairman of Missouri River Country Tourism Region, told the Daily Montanan. “We’re in Montana, kind of. But when tourists think of Montana, they think of Glacier, they think of Yellowstone, they think of mountains. They don’t think of the cool things in eastern Montana, so it’s always been tough for us to get attention.”
Among the top attractions surveyed visitors mentioned was Makoshika State Park, the state’s largest, which features badland formations and numerous dinosaur fossil remains. Four percent of visitors to the region stopped at Makoshika, according to surveys.  


A few highlights from the ITRR report:

4.84 million – Tourists who passed through eastern Montana, with 2.62 million staying overnight
74% of visitors were repeat travelers to Montana
$460 million – spent on fuel across all EMI zone
500% – Increase in spending on rental cabins, condos and homes between 2018 and 2023
73% – portion of visitors who arrived via car
21% – portion of visitors who arrived via RV
19% of visitors were from North Dakota and Minnesota
10% of visitors were from Washington.
39% of visitors were drawn to the uncrowded open spaces
Yellowstone National Park – The top site visited by nonresidents who spent a night in eastern Montana.
Little Bighorn Battlefield – The most visited site in eastern Montana, with 10% of visitors stopping there.
4% of travelers visited a dinosaur attraction



Trumpower has been part of the organization since its incorporation more than 30 years ago. He said that the organization had seen some decline in visitors in the 2010s, but following the pandemic saw a substantial change as people opted to avoid crowded areas, like popular national parks. 
“Those places are getting at or past capacity, people are looking for other things and here we are,” Trumpower said. “We’ve been promoting that: Don’t want a crowd? We’ve got cool stuff over here.” 
He said the organization has launched new initiatives to highlight the region’s attractions, including the Talking Trail, a series of 42 historical sites, museums, and recreation areas close to U.S.  Highway 2, the main thoroughfare through the northern part of the state. 
“We’ve worked very hard to make that successful,” Trumpower said. “People are coming out to the big open and experiencing some history with nobody else around. There’s been a real uptick.”
As much of eastern Montana tourism is people passing through to other areas, diverting drivers and RVers — “such an uptick in RVers and they spend so much time here” — to places “just out of sight” of the highway has made a huge difference, Trumpower said. 
 Shifting industry

There are still some barriers to overcome, including the lower levels of infrastructure and amenities to support tourism in eastern Montana, a holdover from how the region’s economy has traditionally operated. 
The ITRR report notes that eastern Montana has traditionally depended on agriculture and fossil fuel extraction for economic stability. But farms and ranches have been in steady decline due to challenges such as drought, urban encroachment, aging demographics, and changing land ownership, while the coal industry has seen production decline nearly 30% between 2018 and 2023, reflecting broader shifts in energy demand and policy.
Slower population growth in eastern Montana — 4% from 2018 to 2023 — compared to the west compounds some of the issues with becoming a tourism hotspot. 
Trumpower said many small towns that might be seeing more tourists often lack the workers to staff restaurants and just a single motel. 
To address some of these barriers, Montana Legislature in 2023 passed Senate Bill 540, which reallocated a portion of revenue from the lodging facility use tax, or bed tax, to support rural tourism initiatives, tribal tourism and under-visited area attraction projects through grants. They can be used for projects including infrastructure development, marketing and promotional activities.
Chart via ITRR
While the 2025 Legislature lowered the portion of the bed tax allocated to these projects, Weddell, the ITRR director, said the programs they fund have the potential to sustain tourism momentum in eastern Montana. 
“It will be exciting to see, five to 10 years from now, how this kind of investment could strengthen infrastructure and expand the visitor economy in eastern Montana,” Weddell said. 
In the new report, researchers surveyed residents about their attitudes towards tourism and tourists, and while 79% said they feel the benefits outweigh the negative impacts, just 51% felt their communities had the necessary amenities to support a tourism economy. 
Overall, ITRR researchers say that having the new report as a baseline will enhance further data collection and research in the future, and provides important information to state leaders, and local communities and businesses navigating the shifting landscape of eastern Montana’s economic future. 
“It’s exciting to see that visitors aren’t just passing through Eastern Montana anymore. They’re staying, spending more, and experiencing what the region has to offer,” Rachel Shouse, of ITRR, told the Daily Montanan. “It’s also special to see how satisfied visitors are. Anyone who’s spent time in Eastern Montana knows how remarkable the people and places are, and it’s great to see that visitors feel that too.”

A lawsuit in Colorado alleges the MyPillow CEO defaulted on a $300,000 loan from podcaster Joe Oltmann. (Nicole Neri/The Minnesota Reformer)Far-right Colorado podcaster Joe Oltmann is suing MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, a onetime ally in the national election conspiracy theory movement, alleging Lindell breached the terms of a $3 million loan agreement, according to a lawsuit filed this week in Douglas County District Court.
The suit, filed by Oltmann’s Villa Pine Drive LLC and co-plaintiff Michelle Klann, alleges that Lindell secured a short-term loan of $3 million from the plaintiffs in August 2023, then failed to repay the loan by the initial maturity date three months later.
“Plaintiffs have made several requests for payment from Defendants since the initial breach to no avail,” the complaint says.
Minnesota-based MyPillow is also named as a defendant.
Lindell subsequently entered into a November 2024 settlement agreement with the plaintiffs, agreeing to make daily payments of $10,300 towards the delinquent loan balance, the suit says — but Lindell has “fail(ed) to make any payments as outlined therein.”

Neither Oltmann nor Lindell responded to inquiries about the lawsuit Wednesday.
The connection between the two men was pivotal in the dissemination of baseless conspiracy theories that alleged widespread fraud in the 2020 election and helped fuel the Jan. 6 insurrection. Oltmann, a Douglas County resident, first rose to prominence in conservative organizing circles during protests against COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020. In the aftermath of the 2020 election, he claimed to have infiltrated an “Antifa conference call” during which he had heard an employee of Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems promise to rig the election against President Donald Trump.
Oltmann’s claims were spread by Lindell’s far-right media network, and by Lindell himself to members of Trump’s inner circle in the weeks preceding Jan. 6. Oltmann and Lindell were among a long list of defendants sued either by Dominion or an ex-employee, Eric Coomer, for defamation. A Colorado jury awarded Coomer $2.3 million in damages from Lindell earlier this year. Dominion’s case against Lindell is still pending, as is a defamation suit filed by Coomer against Oltmann.
Claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent or compromised have been debunked by elections officials, experts, media investigations, law enforcement, the courts and Trump’s own campaign and administration officials.
Oltmann’s lawsuit against Lindell seeks relief in the form of repayment of the full settlement amount, or the transfer of title to several properties in Minnesota and Texas that Lindell put up as collateral for the loan, as well as interest and unspecified further monetary damages and attorney fees.
Lindell was also sued for defamation by Smartmatic, another elections technology company, in 2022. In connection with that case, he told a federal judge in April that he was “in ruins” and not able to pay court-ordered sanctions to the company.
“I borrowed everything I can. Nobody will lend me any money anymore,” Lindell told the judge, according to ABC News. “I can’t turn back time … but I will tell you, I don’t have any money.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-05 18:57:32+00:00,CT Mirror,CT housing authorities will have federal money through Dec. What’s next is unclear,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/05/ct-housing-authorities-federal-funding/,"CT housing authorities have federal funding through December, but what will come next for those who rely on the government to stay housed?","Connecticut housing authorities have federal funding through the end of the year, but as the federal shutdown continues, it’s not clear what will come next for thousands of residents who rely on the government to keep them in their homes.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development told the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials that funding would be available through the end of December, the association said late last month. Still, Connecticut officials are monitoring the situation in Washington and worry about what will happen, especially for thousands of people with housing choice vouchers.
The majority of the more than 150,000 families in Connecticut who rely on housing authorities to cover all or a portion of their rent are in the Housing Choice Voucher program, also known as Section 8. Through that program, families rent from a private landlord and the housing authority pays part of their rent.
Those families would be the most in danger of losing their housing if HUD funding shuts off, local officials said.
“That’s the exposure right now,” said Neil Griffin, executive director of the Glastonbury Housing Authority and vice president of housing and legislation at the Connecticut chapter of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. He said most housing authorities should have funds to cover people for a couple of months after federal funds dry up.
In 2019, during the 35-day government shutdown that was at the time the longest shutdown in U.S. history, tenants in government-assisted housing across the country faced eviction and pressure from landlords to make up the portion of the rent the government usually covers.
The current shutdown surpassed the 2019 shutdown as the longest in history on Wednesday. 
On Friday, the national association told members that HUD would pay operating funds through December. 
“Previously, HUD had publicly stated that if a shutdown were to occur, it would obligate the first two weeks of November funding for the HCV program, but remained silent on the rest of November,” a statement from the national association said.
Chris D’Orso, executive director of the Waterbury Housing Authority, said his agency has enough in other accounts to cover about two months of rent for residents, but he’s not sure what they’ll do after that. Covering rent without the expected federal subsidies will take a toll on the agency’s finances, he said.
Waterbury has about 2,500 families with housing vouchers.
“I think with the first one, both sides weren’t as dug in as they are now,” he said of the last shutdown. “There were ongoing talks, and there was kind of some light at the end of the tunnel. I’m just not seeing that right now.”
He added that it’s not just tenants who suffer if the government doesn’t pay bills next year. Landlords will also miss out on money.
Vincent Tufo, executive director of Charter Oak Communities in Stamford, said his agency has a unique funding structure that will offer some stability, particularly for public housing residents. The biggest impact, he said, would be on the housing choice voucher program.
Charter Oak Communities has several of its own properties designated for people with low incomes, but those properties draw most of their operating budget from the rents. It’s discounted rent, but there isn’t a portion paid by the housing authority. The lower rent comes about because the agency is a nonprofit and not driven by the need to earn money in the same way as a private business.
About half of their operating budget, or $35 million annually, comes from housing choice vouchers. The agency doesn’t have enough reserve funding to cover one month’s worth of rental payments, and there has been minimal communication from HUD, he said.
“Shutdowns in the past were more collaborative, and certainly with better communication and preparation,” he said.
Public housing residents who live in properties owned by housing authorities aren’t likely to lose their housing in the event HUD payments for January don’t come through, Griffin said.
That problem would be more focused on the cost to maintain their homes, he said.
Griffin added that they are hopeful there’s a solution before it comes to a bigger problem in January.
“We’re kind of hoping a solution will come forward before we create a problem and issue negative possibilities,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25273473354419-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-05 14:01:25.571942

Gov. Andy Beshear speaks in Louisville. (Screenshot/LouisvilleMetroTV)Following a deadly plane crash in Louisville on Tuesday, Gov. Andy Beshear has declared Kentucky is in a state of emergency. 
The declaration “allows us to move resources more quickly through Emergency Management and the Kentucky National Guard,” Beshear said during a Wednesday press conference. 
“It allows state resources to be used, also through our agencies, to be readily available, including Disaster Resource Management, expenses related to response and more, as well as reimbursement,” he said. “It’s going to help to make sure that groups that are already limited in terms of their funding can get some immediate or short term help as they wait for reimbursement for the costs that they’ve expended.” 
As of noon Wednesday, there were nine confirmed deaths from the plane crash. Beshear said that he expects to confirm a 10th soon and “we hope it doesn’t grow by too many more.” 
Officials say at least nine killed in Louisville plane crash

UPS Flight 2976, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 aircraft, crashed around 5:15 p.m. EST after departing from the airport. It was bound for Honolulu. Three people were on board that flight, officials have said. 
More than 200 first responders came to the scene, Beshear said, including firefighters who managed to contain a “blazing inferno created by a plane with 38,000 gallons of aviation fuel.” 
“It could have been significantly worse, and (they) have, in fact, gotten the situation to where the shelter in place is now so much smaller than anyone would have predicted it would be at this time,” Beshear said. 
People who live “immediately around the crash site” should avoid consuming tap water, Beshear said. Other than that: “if you are in the suburbs, if you’re in other parts of Louisville, you are as safe today as you’ve been any other day. The air is fine, your water is fine.” 
Help is available 
People needing mental health support have a few resource options, according to Mental Health America of Kentucky: 

Call or text the Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990
Call the 24-hour Crisis Center at 1-800-273-8255
Text Mental Health America at 741741
If you are contemplating suicide, call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988. 

There is also a victim family reunification set up at the Louisville Metro Police Training Academy at 2911 Taylor Blvd. 
Beshear also announced that he’s amending the Team Kentucky Storm Relief Fund so victims of non-storm disasters can also get help. 
“The first thing that we pay for out of these funds are funerals, so that in a time of grief, nobody is worried about that,” he said. “In Kentucky, we grieve together and we support one another.”  
Funds will also go to response, recovery and rebuilding.

The university governing body announced Wednesday that Cook, an ISU alum with teaching and leadership experience at North Dakota State and Kansas University, will come to Ames Thursday for campus interviews and a public forum. The forum will take place from 4-5 p.m. in the Durham Great Hall of the Memorial Union, and will be livestreamed for those who cannot attend in person.
In his curriculum vitae, published online by the board of regents, Cook stated that he is “committed to advancing Iowa State’s mission as a student-centric, innovative, global land-grant leader.”

Cook is the second candidate for the role slated to visit campus this week, with Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Dean Benjamin Houlton participating in interviews and a forum Wednesday. The candidate selected by the Iowa Board of Regents will replace President Wendy Wintersteen when she retires at the start of 2026.
Cook received his bachelor’s degrees in political science and speech communication from ISU in 1992, then earned a master’s and doctoral degrees in organizational communication from Kansas University.
Before going to North Dakota State University in 2022 to serve as president, Cook worked in various roles at the University of Kansas Medical Center starting in 1998. He moved to the University of Kansas in 2013, serving as vice chancellor and founding dean of KU Edwards Campus and School of Professional Studies for eight years before becoming vice chancellor for public affairs and economic development in 2020.
As a 2011-2012 American Council on Education Fellow, Cook said in the curriculum vitae he was “mentored by (University of North Carolina – Chapel Hill) Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Bruce Carney to better understand and study higher education leadership at a top public AAU, R1 institution.”
In his current presidency at North Dakota State University, Cook is part of an 11-institution higher education system overseen by the State Board of Higher Education of North Dakota, according to his curriculum vitae.
North Dakota State employs 630 faculty and 1,570 staff and educates 12,000 undergraduate and graduate students. Also a land-grant institution, the university houses five academic colleges, seven agricultural research extension centers and 53 extension offices — one for every North Dakota county.
Cook reduced the number of academic colleges from seven to five, his curriculum vitae stated, and implemented a new, 10-year strategic plan during his time at North Dakota State. He also eliminated or merged 29 academic programs, reduced 80 positions and brought down operating costs by $24 million, which the document stated he reinvested into 17 new academic programs.
Both graduation and first-year retention rates have grown during Cook’s tenure, and the curriculum vitae stated he stabilized and increased enrollment “for (the) first time after 10 years of continuous decline.” He also focused on fundraising for research and capital projects, supported athletics and launched new academic programs and initiatives surrounding artificial intelligence.

Both districts had already been operating on the schedule but required voter approval to continue (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).When the Independence School District announced it was switching to a four-day week during the 2023-24 school year, it drew questions from local families and statewide officials.
Parents wondered what kind of child care they would have on days without classroom instruction. And lawmakers debated whether the state needed to intervene.
Ultimately, Missouri’s General Assembly passed a law requiring a vote for non–rural school districts to authorize a four-day week.
On Tuesday, the Independence and Hallsville school districts became the first large districts to receive the approval of voters to continue with four-day weeks.
“I knew that the majority of our community supported it,” Hallsville Superintendent Tyler Walker told The Independent. “I was a little bit surprised to see how much support it was.”
In Hallsville, residents had two questions on the ballot related to the school district. One asked about the four-day week and the other was a bond measure previously passed in April but not confirmed by the State Auditor.
Four-day school week faces scrutiny from Missouri legislature, state education board

The election drew 25% of registered voters, according to the Boone County Clerk, and 75% of those voted in favor of the four-day school week. The vote authorizes the schedule for the next 10 years, when then the district will have to hold another special election.
Walker didn’t think the margin would be that wide. Earlier surveys from the district’s 2022 adoption of the schedule put approval at around 60%.
He believes that the district’s growing success on standardized tests and other publicly available metrics have given families confidence that the four-day week isn’t such a bad thing.
“Our community has grown to appreciate the four day week more after experiencing it for a few years,” he said.
Todd Fuller, director of communications for the Missouri State Teachers Association, told The Independent that voters in districts who have already been operating in a four-day week like Independence and Hallsville have an idea of how it works for their students. The state law, passed in 2024, will require a vote prior to the schedule’s adoption for those who do not already adopt the abbreviated week.
“Anyone who’s a constituent of the district has had time to digest this process, and they’ve been able to decide over a two-year period whether it’s been beneficial or not beneficial for their kids,” Fuller said. “So if they are expressing that feeling with their vote, then we’re going to have a pretty good understanding of what they really want.”
The association doesn’t have an official stance on the four-day week. But Fuller said the teachers it represents have been pleased with the schedule.
Jorjana Pohlman, president of Independence’s branch of the Missouri National Education Association, told The Independent that the overall sentiment is positive from the district’s educators.
Mondays out of the classroom have become a good time for teachers to have doctor’s appointments, spend time with their families and plan for the week ahead, she said.
“In the beginning, it was fear of the unknown for families as well as teachers,” she said. “A lot of teachers had the attitude of, ‘Let’s try it.’ They, I think overall, felt it was a positive thing.”
A study by Missouri State University researchers looked at recent applicants to teaching positions in Independence, finding that the four-day week was a key part of the district’s recruitment.
In particular, 63% of applicants rated the four-day schedule as a top-three reason for applying, and 27% said it was their top priority.
The study also looked at the value of the four-day week for applicants, asking how much they would sacrifice in salary to work at a district with the schedule. On average, applicants were willing to sacrifice $2267 annually for the four-day week.
Walker said the schedule has also improved recruitment in Hallsville, with a dramatic uptick in veteran teachers applying to positions.
With teachers coming to Independence schools particularly for their schedule, some worried that returning to a five-day week would have large consequences for staffing. But Pohlman said a survey showed that the loss of educators is less than many would think.
“The educators, they care deeply about their students, and they want what’s best for students and for the community, whether it’s four day week or five day week,” she said. “They are still going to be committed.”
Almost a third of Missouri districts have adopted a four-day week, with around 91% of those districts in rural settings. Only districts in cities with at least 30,000 residents, or those located in Jackson, Clay, St. Louis, Jefferson and St. Charles counties, must call for a vote before moving to a four-day week.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/080624_Vote1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-11-05 14:01:25.571942

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With a third of Augusta school board seats on the ballot Tuesday, city residents backed all three candidates that were supported by the Maine Democratic Party, rejecting at least one challenger who campaigned on rolling back the district’s inclusive transgender policy.
The school board has made recent headlines for increasingly tense debates over the policy, which upholds students’ right to access teams and school facilities aligning with their gender identity, as Maine law requires. For example, earlier this month, three attendees stripped off their clothes during a public meeting to make a statement about what they described as the discomfort of cisgender students when asked to share spaces with trans students. 
The school board election was seen by some as a popular referendum on the current policy. Earlier this year, several bills aiming to rescind protections for trans students failed passage in the Maine Legislature, but local districts have been considering changing their rules, and at least eight already have.
Maine towns to weigh in on minimum wage, child care, and public education battles

At-large incumbent Rita Pello defeated challenger Kelly Smith with over 58% of the vote. Smith told the Kennebec Journal ahead of the election that one of her priorities is to “uphold Title IX while protecting fairness in female sports.” 
The Trump administration has claimed that including transgender girls’ in girls sports violates federal anti-discrimination law, though that argument has not been backed by the courts.
In a Facebook post after the results were announced, Pello said she’s grateful for “those in our community that quietly voted for students’ and our schools’ best interests.”
In the open race for Ward 4, Bobby-Jo Bechard defeated Jaden Siracusa and William Clardy, who in a previous bid for Maine Legislature said if elected he would “question an office under the Attorney General which has been actively pushing gender politics into pre-pubescent grade levels.”
Bechard said ahead of the vote, “I think it’s important for the community to know that every student should feel seen, supported and inspired, no matter their background or circumstances and that’s really important to me.” 
Samuel Baker ran unopposed for Ward 1, defeating declared write-in John Reny.
Katrina Ray-Saulis, an Augusta resident who works in education, said the results show that city residents “are not interested in continuing the unnecessary drama that’s been happening at our school board and city council meetings.”
Democrats did well nationally in Tuesday’s election. There were no statewide races but Maine voters rejected a referendum that sought to require voter identification and limit absentee voting while backing an initiative to implement an additional gun safety measure known as a red flag law.

Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey won a third term on Wednesday, overcoming a tough challenge from three rivals working together as a team to topple him.
Frey had a 10-point lead over Sen. Omar Fateh, his strongest challenger, on Tuesday evening, and he received 50% of the votes after first- and second-choice votes were tallied.
Progressives and democratic socialists in Minnesota’s largest city again failed to out-rank Frey. With the financial help of city business interests, Frey convinced enough voters that Minneapolis’ falling crime rates and relatively modest rent increases compared to other large cities earned him a third term.
Frey thanked his supporters in a statement Wednesday.
“Minneapolis is a great city rising, and our future is bright,” Frey said. “From right now through my final seconds as mayor, I will work tirelessly to make our great city a place where everyone, regardless of who you are or where you come from, can build a brilliant life in an affordable home and a safe neighborhood.”
Fateh will return to the Minnesota Senate with an even higher profile, continuing a rapid ascent. He moved to Minnesota a decade ago and then scored an upset victory over a prominent state senator in 2020. His campaign received national media coverage and he earned the moniker “The Mamdani of Minneapolis,” a reference to the democratic socialist candidate for mayor of New York City. Mamdani won his election Tuesday.
In a statement, Fateh said he was proud of his campaign even though it was unable to prevail over big-money political action committees and wealthy donors.
“They may have won this race, but we have changed the narrative about what kind of city Minneapolis can be. Because now, truly affordable housing, workers’ rights, and public safety rooted in care are no longer side conversations; they are at the center of the narrative,” Fateh said.
Fateh’s loss signals that Minneapolis voters weren’t ready to back his democratic socialist agenda, which included a city income tax and rent control. He also wouldn’t commit to reappointing Minneapolis Chief Brian O’Hara. During his 2020 Senate campaign, he expressed support for defunding police, and he supported a failed 2021 ballot initiative to dismantle the police department and reconstitute it under the control of the City Council. This year, he signed a petition that called for Minneapolis police officers to arrest masked federal agents.
In Dinkytown, University of Minnesota Junior Bailey Taylor said Tuesday that Fateh’s past support for defunding the police was a reason he ranked Frey first.
“I don’t agree with defunding the police because that is a bit silly, especially in a city like this,” Taylor said.
Frey’s win means he will likely continue to butt heads with a City Council that is controlled by a progressive bloc. A big money coalition was unable to dislodge several Minneapolis progressives from the council. Since progressives gained control of the council two years ago, Frey has vetoed many of their proposals, including a carbon emissions fee and minimum pay rates for Uber and Lyft drivers, though the latter eventually became law after the Legislature took it up.
In addition to an adversarial council, Frey confronts a city in transition and still recovering from the pandemic, which has eroded commercial property values and pushed property taxes higher for homeowners. 
On the campaign trail, mayoral candidates DeWayne Davis, Jazz Hampton and Fateh formed an alliance, creating a united opposition to the incumbent mayor and telling voters to not rank Frey.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/P1196797-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-05 14:01:25.571942

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)The Nevada Division of Social Services on Wednesday delivered approximately $29 million in food assistance benefits to the EBT cards of over 196,000 households.
The amount represents roughly a third of the $90 million the federal government normally provides Nevadans each month through its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP. The distribution comes after two federal judges ordered the Trump administration to use existing emergency reserves to partially pay out November benefits, which were supposed to start going out on Saturday.
A state administrator, in an email obtained by the Nevada Current, confirmed the distributions were made early Wednesday. She said some SNAP recipients won’t receive any benefits and many will receive less than 50% of what they are approved for. The distribution followed partial payment guidance from the USDA.
The state is expected to formally announce the distribution of the payments today.
In a statement, Retail Association of Nevada President Bryan Wachter said his organization confirmed SNAP funds have been successfully loaded onto EBT cards: “This is welcome news for thousands of Nevada families and for the retailers who help ensure access to food and essential goods every day.”
Wachter added that the partial payments will only provide “short-term relief.”
“Nevada families still face uncertainty about the remainder of November’s benefits,” he added. “We appreciate Governor (Joe) Lombardo and Majority Leader (Nicole) Cannizzaro for recognizing the urgency of this issue and for their willingness to explore state-level solutions during the upcoming special session.”
Cannizzaro and the Nevada Senate Democratic caucus on Tuesday announced that if a special legislative session is called later this month, as expected, they plan to introduce legislation to establish an emergency cash assistance program to act as a substitute for the lapsed SNAP benefits.

Pinsky, director of the Maryland Energy Administration, served seven terms in the Senate and two terms in the House of Delegates. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Mattera)Paul Pinsky, who went from a back bencher in the General Assembly, out of step ideologically with most of his colleagues, to a major architect of consequential legislation, and who now is a key member of Gov. Wes Moore’s administration, will end his 39 years of state service later this month.
Pinsky, 75, informed his staff Wednesday morning that he is stepping down as director of the Maryland Energy Administration, a job he has held since 2023 after three dozen years in the legislature.
In an interview, Pinsky noted that most of his contemporaries have retired from full-time work – and said there’s much he wants to do in the years ahead beyond serving in public office.
“I’m the last person standing,” he said. “I do this with mixed emotions. I’m still having fun. I think I’m a good leader. But I don’t want to drop dead in a year without being able to do X, Y and Z.”
Even at the start of his political career, Pinsky called himself a progressive, when few Maryland Democrats would, only to see the party move gradually in his direction. In the years ahead he hopes to impart wisdom he’s gained from his experiences as a liberal leader in a state whose political establishment is centrist and often resistant to change.
“I want to do some writing about the lessons I’ve learned over the years, particularly for younger activists who want to run for state or local offices,” he said.
Pinsky has at times been called “the Bernie Sanders of Maryland,” and their careers have dovetailed to an extent. Pinsky said that, like Sanders, his “mantra” has been “putting people’s needs ahead of corporate greed.”
Drawing on his skills as a longtime political organizer, Pinsky has co-authored some of the most significant legislation in recent Maryland history, including the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan and the Climate Solutions Now law that sets aggressive climate mandates for the state. Since joining the Moore administration, Pinsky has been an integral part of the state’s efforts to expand its clean energy portfolio.

But he was a political outlier when he was elected in 1986 to represent Prince George’s County’s District 22 in the House of Delegates, far to the left of his Democratic colleagues and party leaders. He teamed up with a fellow freshman, Brian Frosh (D-Montgomery), who went on to become state attorney general, and later with another young lawmaker, Chris Van Hollen (D-Montgomery), now Maryland’s senior U.S. senator, to form a liberal “Three Musketeers” in the legislature.
They were often at odds with the House speaker, Clay Mitchell, a conservative Democrat from the Eastern Shore. Pinsky shakes his head thinking about those days, recalling being on the losing end of several 131-10 votes.
The longtime state Senate president, Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D), a fellow Prince Georgian, sought unsuccessfully to keep Pinsky from moving up to the Senate in 1994. But Pinsky persevered, advancing slowly but surely into Senate leadership – and in 2019, Miller would hand Pinsky the gavel to the powerful Senate Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee.
Miller, who died in 2021, eventually found his colleague to be frank and reliable – one of the most dependable members of the Senate.
“He’s come a long way,” Miller said in a 2019 interview. “We still disagree on a lot of personal views, but I trust him implicitly. He’s an honest man.”
Pinsky grew up in the New Jersey suburbs of Philadelphia and came to Washington, D.C., in 1968 to attend George Washington University. At GW, he participated in multiple student protests, falling in with a crowd of left-wing activists who became lifelong friends.
From 1976 to 1995, Pinsky was a history teacher for the Prince George’s County Public Schools – and learned the vagaries of local politics by spending four years as president of the county teachers’ union. While teaching and coaching basketball at Fairmont Heights High School, Pinsky met his future wife, Joan Rothgeb, a fellow teacher who later became an administrator in the school district – and was also a scholastic basketball coach. Pinsky later became an organizer with the Montgomery County teachers’ union.
By his own account, Pinsky often found himself on the fringes of the political debate in his early years in Annapolis, focusing on things like predatory corporate practices and whether Maryland National Guard troops should be deployed to war-torn Central America.

In 1990, after Sanders, the mayor of Burlington, Vermont, was elected to Congress, Pinsky was one of a handful of Washington, D.C.-area progressives asked to organize a “Welcome to D.C.” event for Sanders. It drew 800 supporters to Eastern Market, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and current and former members of Congress. Years later, in 2016, Pinsky was an elected delegate for Sanders’ presidential campaign at the Democratic National Convention.
In 1994, Pinsky prepared to challenge his district’s incumbent senator, Thomas P. O’Reilly, the chair of the Finance Committee, in the Democratic primary. Miller, Pinsky recalled, threatened to spend $100,000 to defeat him.
At a bullroast for U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) that year, Pinsky confronted Miller, who had asked him how he was doing.
“I’d be better, Mike,” Pinsky replied, “if you’d stay the hell out of my race.”
Miller eventually backed off; O’Reilly wound up resigning before the end of his term to join the State Workers Compensation Commission, and Pinsky was appointed to replace him. He won a full term that fall – and Van Hollen and Frosh joined him in moving up to the Senate.
In their first Senate term, the three lawmakers and several of their colleagues sought to derail a deal to bring two professional football stadiums to Maryland – Pinsky arguing at the time that taxpayers shouldn’t subsidize “pleasure palaces for plutocrats.”
They fell short, but the vote was by no means a sure thing, and Pinsky said he quickly saw the advantages of being in the Senate.
“The Senate is much more fun, when you’re one of 47 [members], when they need 24 votes to pass things,” he observed. “It’s harder for you to be marginalized.”
Pinsky, Van Hollen and Frosh remain good friends, and at the time, Pinsky said, he felt exhilarated being able to collaborate with them. “It made it easier and more fun to strategize.” Van Hollen has called Pinsky “a kindred spirit.”
Pinsky said the smaller size of the chamber also enabled him to forge personal relationships with colleagues he wasn’t in sync with ideologically – including Miller.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In the Senate, Pinsky focused mostly on education, the environment, and political reform, notching some victories and some defeats. When Miller made Frosh, the Senate’s leading environmentalist, chair of the Judicial Proceedings Committee in 2003, Pinsky knew he had to pick up the mantle.
“I was like, what?” Pinsky recalled. “You’re it. It was a weight on me, frankly. I felt a duty, an obligation to do more on the environment.”
In 2006, he authored the Healthy Air Act, which imposed strict emissions controls on Maryland power plants and paved the way for the state to join the multi-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which sells carbon credits to polluters. The revenues are largely used to fund clean energy.
Pinsky also passed a bill making it easier for Maryland teachers to receive national board certification.
He gained clout over the years through his seniority, at the same time his relationship with Miller grew closer. Pinsky said he and Miller would run into each other at University of Maryland basketball games, and would make time to chat. Pinsky’s wife was diagnosed with cancer several years ago (she died in 2020, at the age of 63); Miller’s cancer diagnosis also created a bond between them.
“Over the years, Mike softened, I softened,” Pinsky reflected. “You came together. With Mike, you always knew where you stood.”
In 2015, Miller appointed Pinsky vice chair of the Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee, which had a broad portfolio, and four years later, after the committee chair, Sen. Joan Carter Conway (D-Baltimore City), lost her reelection bid, he handed Pinsky the gavel.
The committee did a lot of heavy lifting during Pinsky’s tenure, passing the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, which Pinsky had spent years crafting with fellow lawmakers, educators, business and civic leaders, and developing the state’s principal climate law.
Pinsky in his final years in the legislature also passed a measure making community college free for most Marylanders, expanded Miller’s Chesapeake Bay Conservation Corps to become a climate corps, and shepherded through a bill requiring Maryland to plant 5 million new trees. He also led the legislative effort to roll back then-Gov. Larry Hogan’s (R) edict that all school systems should delay the opening of the school year until after Labor Day – creating controversy by comparing Hogan to Southern state governors in the 1950s and ‘60s who stood in the doorways of schools to prevent Black students from entering.

Pinsky said there was no single “Aha!” moment that made him think he had arrived as a serious policymaker after years as a bombthrower.
“It was a gradual transition,” he said, adding, “I never not wanted to be a bombthrower. I always wanted to put people ahead of corporate interests.”
But Pinsky marveled thinking about a time, when he was the committee chair, that a highly-compensated utility executive sat in his office, pressing his case for an initiative that Pinsky opposed.
“I thought to myself, what are you doing here?” he recalled. “How did I get here?”
Pinsky credited the activists he worked with on several issues to help him achieve his legislative successes. “Half my time is spent mobilizing with the base, because they’re going to make my life easy,” he said.
But Pinsky can still tally his legislative losses. He tried for years to bring “combined reporting” to Maryland – where related corporations are treated as single entities for tax purposes, a provision more than 20 other states have. Pinsky remains frustrated that lawmakers have been so reluctant to embrace this reform, which would provide substantial additional revenues.
Pinsky unsuccessfully fought legislation that gives gas companies subsidies from ratepayers to build infrastructure. His bills to ban candy and soda and corporate advertising from public schools failed. Political reform measures – including public financing for legislative campaigns – stalled.
“You have a progressive agenda, you get a few things done, but you also encounter roadblocks,” Pinsky said. “I was hoping some of the things I was talking about would become more mainstream.”
When Miller decided to step down as Senate president in 2019 after 33 years, Pinsky was among a handful of Democrats who kicked the tires on a possible bid to replace him, but eventually abandoned the idea. Baltimore City Sen. Bill Ferguson eventually won Democratic Caucus support unanimously to succeed Miller.

	Shortly after Moore was elected governor in 2022, he turned to Pinsky to head the Maryland Energy Administration. Pinsky, who had spent the past year shepherding the climate bill to final passage – and winning an eighth Senate term – was ready for a new challenge. But he also conceded that his desire to “push the envelope” during the Climate Solutions Now debate “created some tensions in the legislature,” which made it a good time to move on.
The MEA director’s role varies from administration to administration. Under Hogan, the MEA became a sleepy agency that shed staff, moved from downtown Annapolis to South Baltimore, and mainly dispensed modest clean energy grants.
Under Moore and Pinsky, the MEA is growing and has played a more central role in the administration’s clean energy and climate strategy.
Just last week, the two announced a $17 million grant program to expand community solar energy use in the state. Although there is an undeniable environmental benefit, the leaders cast the program as a cost-saving measure for certain ratepayers.
“The reason we are so focused on the issue of energy affordability is because we hear from our constituents about it every day,” Moore said. “That’s why we’re taking this important step forward to make energy more sustainable and bring prices down in communities across the state.”
Pinsky last week also headlined a news conference at a union hall in Baltimore, with Van Hollen and environmental leaders, reiterating the state’s commitment to building offshore wind energy projects despite the Trump administration’s opposition.
Pinsky admitted that when he was invited to lead the agency, he didn’t know much about energy policy, despite his years pushing environmental initiatives. But he quickly came to see that energy and climate are inextricably linked, and he has been happy in his role – offering effusive praise for the staff at MEA.
“I’m lucky in getting some pretty smart people around me, who make me look good,” he said. So many staffers, Pinsky said, believe in the agency’s mission, “which is so damn cool.”
But that will soon come to an end. Pinsky has no immediate plans – other than some household chores and spending a week in Belize with his adult daughters, who both live in Washington, D.C. (given his family’s progressive leanings, one daughter once asked him if it would be OK if she took a job in the private sector, Pinsky recalled with a laugh).
In his heart, Pinsky is still a protestor and an organizer – he attended two different “No Kings” rallies in his neighborhood in October. And that will continue even when he’s out of state government.

(Screenshot from meeting)About 3,000 Indiana students are repeating third grade this school year for not meeting the state’s reading proficiency standards.
Data released Wednesday by the Indiana Department of Education showed 3.6% of the 84,000 children who took the statewide IREAD exam were retained in third grade under the first enforcement of a requirement approved by the Legislature in 2024.
Those 3,040 retained students is more than seven times the 412 children held back in third grade two years ago.
Education Secretary Katie Jenner credited improved performance by students in the IREAD exam given last school year with the retention figure being lower than anticipated when the literacy requirement was being debated.
“The numbers that were being thrown out is that it would be 7,000 to 10,000 that this law would trigger retention,” Jenner told State Board of Education members. “But, in fact, a huge shout out to our teachers and our people, we have thousands of kids who are now readers.”
Literacy overhaul bill — with third grade retention requirement — heads to Indiana governor

Education officials announced in August that 87.3% of third graders — about 73,500 out of more than 84,000 students statewide — demonstrated proficient reading skills in 2024-25. They hailed the nearly five percentage point improvement from the previous school year as the largest year-to-year jump since the state began IREAD testing in 2013.
That left about 10,600 children who didn’t meet the standard, with almost 7,000 being given “good cause exemptions” to avoid retention. Nearly 75% of those given exemptions were special education students and about 24% are English learners with less than two years of specific literacy services.
Anna Shults, the Department of Education’s chief academic officer, said the new retention requirement was having its intended effect.
“We are now ensuring that students that are promoted on to grade four are doing so with an ability to read and show mastery of key foundational reading skills,” Shults told the State Board of Education.
The Department of Education will have an online dashboard providing breakdowns of the Indiana Reading Evaluation and Determination assessment, or IREAD, by school district and individual schools, including charter schools and nonpublic schools.
Officials noted about 670 children who didn’t meet the literacy standards were not enrolled in Indiana schools this year, saying they likely moved out of state or were being homeschooled.
Jenner said a determination would need to be made about those students if they returned to Indiana schools.
“That’s a question that we’ll need to sort through, because some may move back into Indiana, or if they left for homeschool may come back in,” Jenner said. “Because we’re looking at every unique student, I think we’ll try to figure out exactly where they are.”
According to 2023 data, 13,840 third-graders did not pass I-READ-3. Of those, 5,503 received an exemption and 8,337 did not. Of those without an exemption, 95% moved onto 4th grade while only 412 were retained.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The rift between an oversight committee and the state’s medical marijuana industry widened Tuesday in Pierre when the committee approved 11 motions after not making them public before the meeting and not allowing public comment on the individual motions, all while lacking attendance by four of the committee’s 11 members.
The intentions of the Medical Marijuana Oversight Committee in proposing and approving some of the motions were unclear. The motions were not presented as formal rule change proposals or as bills for the legislative session that starts in January. 
The topics of the motions varied widely and included recommendations for tighter regulations on the medical marijuana industry, tighter regulation of intoxicating products sold outside of the industry in convenience stores and smoke shops, and statements of support or recommendations on an array of other issues.
“My understanding is these are just motions, correct?” said Sen. Lauren Nelson, R-Yankton, a committee member. “So, some of these motions that were approved today will never be heard of again, maybe. Some of these motions might become bills carried by one of us, somebody else that’s in the Legislature, and then we can have our discussion.”

Medical marijuana industry lobbyist Jeremiah Murphy asked that the minutes reflect that no advance public notice was given regarding the motions and that no public comment was taken on any of the individual motions. 
“If you want to just call these ‘motions,’ that’s fine,” Murphy said, “But the key is that they not be considered anything like legislation because they were not posted in advance. A bill or resolution must be posted in advance of the hearing.”
The votes capped a combative meeting that was similar in tone to the committee’s prior meeting two weeks ago. That earlier meeting resulted in industry complaints about a day-long slate of invited speakers who presented mostly negative views about marijuana.
Oversight committee testimony sends ‘shock wave’ through SD medical marijuana industry

The committee’s membership consists of four legislators and seven non-legislators, including members from the medical, counseling, law enforcement and patient communities. The absent committee members Tuesday were all non-legislators: Francine Arneson, Kristi Palmer, Andrew Schock and Sioux Falls Police Chief Jon Thum.
At the end of Tuesday’s meeting, the committee took public comment from individuals, capped at two minutes each. 
Kittrick Jeffries, with Puffy’s Dispensary in Rapid City, said the panel was “hashing out issues that the voters decided five years ago.” South Dakota voters legalized medical marijuana in 2020, and the state implemented the program in 2022. There are 17,137 patient cardholders in the state.
“This committee, in my opinion, has only made it harder for patients to access medical cannabis,” Jeffries said. 
Emmett Reistroffer, with Genesis Farms Cannabis Company, called the panel a “show committee” and questioned the motivation of the chairwoman, Rep. Josephine Garcia, R-Watertown, noting she co-sponsored unsuccessful legislation earlier this year to repeal the state’s medical marijuana program. 
“I don’t think you have any business chairing an oversight committee on a program that you publicly opposed in the last legislative session,” Reistroffer said. “Of course, you don’t like what I have to say, but I have two minutes. I am a citizen of the state of South Dakota.”
For that, Garcia muted Reistroffer, but then unmuted him. 
“You can’t mute a member of the public,” Reistroffer said upon being unmuted. He said the action “further cements the fact that this is a show committee.”
Garcia again muted him. 
“The reason that gentleman was gaveled out was for many reasons,” Garcia said. She said he “had things going up online, defaming or whatever he was doing to me.” 
She added, “I believe I’ve been fair, more than fair, and it’s just a disgrace.”
In further public comments, Rep. Travis Ismay, R-Newell, who is not a member of the committee, alleged he saw a state health inspector hug an industry representative outside the room. Ismay was the prime sponsor of the bill to repeal the medical marijuana program that Garcia cosponsored, and he also previously attempted to put an initiative on the ballot to repeal the program. 
“I don’t believe that they’re that trustworthy,” Ismay said of the industry at large.
Department of Health Secretary Melissa Magstadt responded that no Department of Health inspectors were present at the meeting. Ismay returned to the microphone, saying he “might have misspoken or something,” saying he may have misidentified the people he saw. 
Genesis Farms lobbyist Mitch Richter pointed back to the prior committee meeting during which Garcia — a physician — said one of her former patients used artificial intelligence to fake documents, obtain medical marijuana, buy 3 ounces, and sell it for $10,000 a week.
Richter said the allegations don’t “hold water.” 
“If you’re making $10,000 on 3 ounces of marijuana, I want to talk to you,” said Richter, who also said the committee should be repealed. 
Reistroffer later told South Dakota Searchlight that 3 ounces of medical marijuana typically sell for around $600. 
Garcia repeatedly defended the committee and herself, saying the panel stayed within its oversight mandate and the actions taken were “just motions.”
“For those that were disrespectful, shame on you,” she said.
 



 Motions considered

The Medical Marijuana Oversight Committee considered the following motions Tuesday.
Approved

Supporting collaboration with the Department of Health to ensure that noncompliance fines for medical marijuana establishments are fair and equitable, following complaints from the industry that the fines are too high.
Encouraging continued discussion about consistency, inspections and fines and collaboration with the Department of Health.
Recommending that products with THC — the high-inducing compound in marijuana — be banned in stores and THC products be sold only in licensed, medical marijuana facilities.
Recommending that law enforcement have better access to the prescription drug monitoring program or medical marijuana users be required to carry their patient cards at all times.
Supporting legislation requiring closer scrutiny to ensure that patients have a bona fide and continuing relationship with a provider, rather than a one-time relationship based only on obtaining a patient card.
Supporting legislation to ensure that follow-up visits with bona fide physicians may be conducted via telehealth.
Recommending a cap on the THC percentage in products.
Recommending mandatory reporting from the Department of Health regarding hospitalizations, “drug driving,” and poisonings resulting from marijuana use. 
Recommending the Department of Health provide public education on marijuana and medical marijuana.
Supporting the creation of an interim study committee on smoke shops.
Supporting the addition of a pharmacist to the oversight committee (the membership currently includes legislators and non-legislators, with state law requiring membership from the medical, counseling, law enforcement and patient communities).

Failed

July 15, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Although the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Region 5 office, which covers Michigan, avoided recent layoffs, fair housing advocates say the cuts elsewhere will still weaken enforcement against housing discrimination nationwide.
In mid-October, Reduction in Force notices went out to over 400 HUD employees, including over 100 in the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, informing them that their positions would no longer exist starting in December. Those notices were primarily in regional HUD offices, with only three offices — Region 2, centered in New York City, Region 5, centered in Chicago, and Region 10, centered in Seattle — avoiding the mass layoffs, according to a statement from the HUD employee union.
Nancy L. Haynes, the executive director of the Fair Housing Center of West Michigan, said that the loss of regional fair housing HUD staff will make it harder — even within regions where the staff still exist — to get issues of housing discrimination resolved.  
“I don’t know how you effectively do fair housing,” Haynes said. “I think now everything will be written up and then sent to headquarters for review, and decisions will all be probably consolidated to come out of headquarters. The groundwork might be done in the regions that remain.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Beth Romeo, executive director of the Fair Housing Center of Southwest Michigan, noted that the changes coming out of the federal HUD administration worry her in terms of the ability of organizations like hers to receive continued funding from HUD.
“In the case of some of the changes that are coming from D.C., that could impact our ability to process those requests or get responses on those requests from HUD, which essentially then translates into people not getting relief or getting support for their discrimination concerns,” Romeo said. “In many cases, in Southwest Michigan and throughout the state, that can result in people becoming unhoused.”
Haynes, whose organization covers the west side of the state up through the Upper Peninsula, added that she believes that those still at HUD remain committed to the mission — but she does not know how they could handle such an inflated workload. 
“This Administration is completely destroying the federal government’s capacity to address housing discrimination,” added Lisa Rice, the president and CEO of the National Fair Housing Alliance in a press release. 
HUD did not respond to a request for comment. 
Further guidance from John Gibbs, the principal deputy assistant secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at HUD, might shed some light on how fair housing enforcement with a smaller workforce might play out. 
Specifically, Gibbs noted in a memo sent to Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity staff that HUD resources should be directed towards “Cases with the Strongest Evidence of Intentional Discrimination.”
The guidance removes “disparate impact” from grounds to take on a housing discrimination case, directing enforcement instead to center on “disparate treatment.” This means that systemic issues like redlining, as well as any issue not falling under the seven federally protected characteristics, will not be eligible to bring to HUD for action. 
Gibbs, who previously served as Ottawa County’s administrator before being fired in Feb. 2024 for “gross misconduct,” argued that the scope of fair housing enforcement had gone too far under prior administrations — “enforcement actions prioritized novel and tenuous theories of discrimination concerned with appraisal bias, environmental justice, local zoning, screening for felony convictions, and gender identity, among others,” the memo wrote.
But Haynes added that this will not have an equal impact on all renters and home buyers. She posed the example of a single occupancy per bedroom policy, which would disproportionately impact a family of four as opposed to a group of four roommates — both groups would require a four-bedroom apartment or home. 
Fair housing enforcement has been on the chopping block for Trump since early in his administration. In February, nearly half of all local fair housing enforcement agencies received notices of cancellation for their funding, totaling around $30 million in cuts. And Trump’s initial budget request, published this spring, asked to cut $60 million from fair housing grants. 
“It definitely seems like fair housing is becoming less of a priority for the administration,” Romeo said. “They’ve made some decisions that really are clear about that position, which is unfortunate, because the need is really there. We get calls every day.”
In Michigan, there were 1,234 total reports of housing discrimination tallied statewide in 2024, according to the National Fair Housing Alliance’s 2025 Fair Housing Trends Report, which was released on Wednesday. 


While that marks a slight decrease, just over 3%, from 2023, the data also shows that certain types of discrimination are on the rise — specifically complaints based on national origin, where Michigan saw one of the largest increases in the country, according to the Fair Housing Trends Report. 
Issues of housing discrimination in Michigan also follow national trends — across the U.S., disability discrimination accounted for over half of the fair housing complaints filed in 2024. Fair housing officials in Michigan noted similar trends. 
“There’s a variety of needs across Southwest Michigan,” Romeo said. “The number one that we see is discrimination against disability, particularly with service animals or emotional support animals.”
As for how to continue forward, fair housing leaders like Haynes and Romeo noted that there are still significant questions on what HUD’s fair housing programs will look like going forward. Answers to those questions are even harder to get during the ongoing federal shutdown, Haynes said, adding that the Michigan Department of Civil Rights has been seeking further clarification from national HUD officials on ongoing guidance. 
“The need and the concerns around discrimination are not going to go away,” Romeo said. “Whatever happens in the next few years, it’s not going to go away. If anything, discrimination is going to increase.”
“We’re trying to figure out how to work together. We already work pretty close,” Haynes added. “Historically, the Michigan fair housing centers have always had a pretty great working relationship. We divide the state up so that we make sure every county even up to the U.P. has a Fair Housing Center. But we’re going to be stretched even thinner.”

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit has reversed a district court’s dismissal of The Conley Group’s claims against the city for First Amendment retaliation and tortious interference with a contract, sending the case back to district court. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal of company CEO Tom Conley’s claims for First Amendment retaliation and defamation.
The appeals court also directed the district court to modify its dismissals on Tom Conley’s claims to be without prejudice, clearing the way for those claims to be relitigated.

The lawsuit stems from a 2019 decision by the City of West Des Moines to hire The Conley Group, a professional security services company, to provide security for the city through the end of 2021.
In 2020, The Conley Group contracted with the City of Des Moines to provide security at its municipal buildings. Months later, in January 2021, Conley wrote a letter to the editor of the Des Moines Register criticizing a series of articles he felt were unfairly critical of local law enforcement’s response to the unrest that followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, who was murdered by an officer while in police custody.
On July 10, 2021, the Register published a front-page story referring to social media posts and emails in which Tom Conley had likened the actions of the protesters to “terrorism” and referred to the protesters as “thugs” and “snotnosed, punk$$ed, basement dwellers.” The article also indicated Conley had described local Black Lives Matter activists as “nothing but weak, punk—ed little sissy b—— who live in their parents’ basement.”
On Aug. 16, 2021, the West Des Moines City Council voted unanimously to terminate The Conley Group’s security services contract, which was due for renewal at the end of the year. Court records indicate that following the decision, council member Cherry “Renee” Hardman sent a text message to a supporter stating she had used “every ounce” of her political capital “to garner this 5-0 vote,” adding, “We will get sued — but we have decided it is a fight worth fighting.”
Conley’s lawsuit alleges that Hardman then asked the City of Des Moines’ city manager when he was going to “get rid of Conley.” At the time, The Conley Group was in the process of selling a portion of its security business and voluntarily terminated its contract with Des Moines to avoid any negative impact on the transaction.
Tom Conley and The Conley Group then sued the City of West Des Moines as well as Hardman and the four other council members who voted to terminate the city’s contract with the company.
As part of the lawsuit, the plaintiffs alleged the defendants engaged in unconstitutional retaliation for Tom Conley exercising his First Amendment rights when the city canceled its contract in response to his statements. They also alleged the defendants interfered with the company’s business contracts by pressuring Des Moines to cancel its contract with the company, and they alleged the defendants defamed Conley by making statements that branded him a racist.
In a March 2024 order, a district court judge granted the city’s motion to dismiss each count of the lawsuit. That order was based in part on findings that Tom Conley lacked standing to claim damages for injuries to the company; that the only speech that triggered the alleged retaliation was made by Conley and not by the company; and the fact that The Conley Group had voluntarily terminated its contract with the City of Des Moines.
Tom Conley appealed, arguing he had standing to bring a claim for First Amendment retaliation because he had sustained damages through defamation that were independent of those suffered by the company.
With regard to the defamation claim, Conley asserted that the City of West Des Moines and other defendants had “made statements directly and impliedly that Tom Conley was a racist, during city council meetings and in statements that were published to third parties, including the media.”
In dismissing that particular claim, the district court stated that “crucially, (the lawsuit) does not identify any statement made by defendants, much less a series of facially non-libelous statements which allow the audience to ‘connect the dots’ to arrive at a defamatory implication.”
Conley argued “the clear implication” of the city’s actions in canceling his contract “was that Tom Conley was a racist and needed to be punished.”
The district court rejected that argument, finding that Conley was essentially attempting to claim defamation based on the city’s actions rather than on specific statements, which was not the “proper basis for a defamation claim.”
The appeals court agreed, stating that “the only statements identified (in the lawsuit) are articles published by the Des Moines Register, and Conley chose not to sue the newspaper.”

The Ocean Springs Board of Aldermen decided Tuesday night to turn the money over to the court, indicating the city is relinquishing any claim to the funds it collected from uninsured motorists.
Three motorists ticketed in Ocean Springs filed the lawsuit in August 2023 against the Georgia-based company that ran the program, Securix LLC. The city is not a party to the lawsuit, but split revenue 50-50 from the uninsured motorist program with the company.
READ MORE: Two Mississippi media companies appeal Supreme Court ruling on sealed court files
The three motorists are seeking class-action status for the lawsuit, filed by Chhabra Gibbs & Herrington of Jackson, so others ticketed in the city also would be represented in the case.
The lawsuit accuses Securix of deceiving vehicle owners by essentially posing as a law enforcement agency through its mailed traffic citations in Ocean Springs.
The city issued a news release after the board voted to relinquish the uninsured motorist fines and fees collected. It said, in part:
“The Southern Poverty Law Center, the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi School of Law, Public Justice, and the law firm of Chhabra, Gibbs & Herrington PLLC raised concerns that Securix violated state and federal law and exposed the city to potential financial liability.“Although Ocean Springs contracted with Securix in 2021 with the intent of encouraging uninsured drivers to obtain car insurance, the city later determined that the program did not function as intended and terminated the contract in May 2023.”
How uninsured motorist program worked
The program used automated license plate readers and artificial intelligence to extract license plates that were then run through a database to determine whether the vehicle owner had insurance.
The police department was supposed to review the information and issue the tickets that Securix mailed out.If a vehicle was not listed as being insured, a ticket went to the owner. The system did not identify the person driving the vehicle. On their face, the citations claimed to be uniform traffic tickets that appeared to be from the police department.
READ MORE: Private business ticketed uninsured Mississippi vehicle owners. Then the program blew up.
The Ocean Springs citation offered three options: Call a toll-free number and provide proof of insurance, enter a diversion program that charges a $300 fee and includes a short online course and requires agreement that the vehicle will not be driven uninsured on public roadways, or contest the ticket in court and risk $510 in fines and fees, plus the potential of a one-year driver’s license suspension.
The funds Ocean Springs is turning over to the court represent the city’s share of proceeds collected from motorists.
Securix is in a separate state court battle with three politically connected Mississippians who formed a company called QJR LLC to join the ticketing business.
Jackson area businessmen Josh Gregory and Quinton Dickerson and Pascagoula attorney Robert Wilkinson formed QJR LLC to partner with Securix. They helped spread the program to numerous other Mississippi cities. Gregory and Dickerson own Frontier Strategies, an advertising company that has run campaigns for state and local politicians.
Wilkinson was the city attorney for Ocean Springs when its Securix contract was signed. Wilkinson resigned from the position in June, after the website GCWire.com, published numerous pieces about the ticketing program and his involvement.
QJR is in a bitter legal dispute with Securix and its chairman, Jonathan Miller, in Chancery Court. QJR wants its partnership with Securix dissolved. The partners lost access to the insured motorist database after Miller accused the Mississippians of wrongdoing. The ticketing program no longer operates in Mississippi.
A trial date in the state case is set for January 12 before Judge Neil Harris, whose son, David Harris, is now the city attorney for Ocean Springs.

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders appointed Harris, who has served as interim commissioner of the Arkansas Insurance Department since August when former commissioner Alan McClain retired. 
As commissioner, Harris will lead the Insurance Department, which protects consumers and ensures the financial stability of insurers, according to an Arkansas Department of Commerce press release. The department also licenses and regulates insurance companies operating in Arkansas, administers the state government’s workers’ compensation program, provides Medicare counseling to senior citizens, and investigates consumer complaints and insurance fraud.
“My top priority as Commissioner is protecting Arkansas consumers and ensuring a fair, stable insurance marketplace…I’m honored to be appointed Commissioner and lead a team so dedicated to serving the people of our state,” Harris said in the release.
Since joining the insurance department in 2012, Harris has held several leadership roles, serving as compliance director and deputy commissioner for market regulation, according to the release. 
“Jimmy’s extensive experience with AID and understanding of its mission make him uniquely equipped to step into this leadership role,” Secretary of Commerce Hugh McDonald said. “Having previously served within the agency, he understands its operations, the industries it regulates, and the consumers it serves.”

Lewis, speaking with the Nebraska Examiner on Tuesday night, said the motion is about Bennett’s general service and not just the budget cuts process, though she said faculty concerns about the budget process are “somewhat emblematic of the leadership style that we’ve been experiencing.”
“It’s unfortunate, because you want to have a really strong leader in times like this, and the leadership has not been there,” Lewis said.
A spokesperson for Bennett declined to comment Wednesday on Lewis’ resolution. Bennett’s annual salary is $732,000.
‘Documented failures’ alleged
The draft resolution argues Bennett has “documented failures in strategic leadership, fiscal stewardship, governance integrity, external relations and personnel management.” It calls upon the University of Nebraska Board of Regents and NU President Jeffrey Gold to conduct an “immediate review of the chancellor’s continued fitness to serve.”

The regents and Dr. Gold would also be urged to move toward removing Bennett or negotiating his departure, according to the draft resolution. In it, faculty ask for a pause in academic program cuts for an interim appointment and substantial restoration of “shared governance.”
Bennett’s contract allows the regents to terminate his contract with “good cause.” Bennett is allowed to resign if he gives Gold at least 60 days notice.
The NU Board of Regents has not voted whether to extend Bennett’s initial three-year contract. It expires June 30. He came to UNL in July 2023 after nearly a decade as president of the University of Southern Mississippi. He annually dealt with budget cuts at Southern Miss.
Bennett’s leadership has coincided with a string of budget cuts at UNL dating back to June 2020 that, in total, has meant the campus weathering more than $75 million in cuts already. At the same time, the Nebraska Legislature and Gov. Jim Pillen, a former regent for 10 years who became governor in 2023, have slowed state investments in the University of Nebraska.
Will contract be extended?
Bennett, asked by the Examiner in October if or when a regents vote on extending his contract might come, said: “No idea.”
“But I sure hope it comes quickly, because I love being here, love being a part of the community and clearly we have important work yet to do,” Bennett said Oct. 5, after the most recent NU Board of Regents meeting.

Gold, also speaking with the Examiner after that October meeting, said he would favor extending Bennett’s contract. He said he didn’t know when it might come to a vote — “hopefully sooner than later” — but said regents would decide.
Bennett’s comments mirror what Lewis said she and other faculty have heard from Bennett in Faculty Senate Executive Committee meetings. It also mirrors what a UNL spokesperson said Sept. 12, when Bennett proposed $27.5 million in budget cuts, that Bennett is committed to leading UNL “toward new levels of excellence well into the future.”
Said Lewis: “That’s great, but it’s not enough. It’s not enough just be enthusiastic and say nice things.”
Lewis and other faculty say Bennett should have worked to address UNL’s structural deficit since he started and implemented a strategy. If Bennett desired a metrics-based review of academic programs, faculty say it should have come sooner. Many faculty have said that if given the time, they could have found alternatives to some or all of the suggested academic program cuts.
The latest round of budget cuts proposes eliminating six academic programs. The proposal also would merge four programs and create two interdisciplinary units combining them.
A new budget evaluation model
UNL Executive Vice Chancellor Mark Button, the top campus academic official, has defended UNL’s metrics-based evaluation of its programs. Button in September said the data-based evaluation was “one measure” in addition to a “holistic” qualitative review of all programs.
“We are very mindful that the data can’t tell you everything,” Button said. “It can’t capture all the things that a unit does, and it wasn’t designed to do so.”
Button said the metrics could continue to be an important part of tracking institutional progress.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
A 21-member advisory committee to Bennett of faculty, staff and students has criticized the metrics, the short time frame to finalize budget cuts and the difficulty in finding alternatives. In an unsigned letter, the committee said academic program cuts should be an “absolute last resort,” and some alternatives need months of “concerted efforts to coordinate, not weeks.”
“We are confident that, had they been given time, the campus would have come together to find creative, positive ways to eliminate the structural deficit without proposed program elimination,” the advisory letter states.
Bennett can ultimately take, or leave, the committee’s recommendations. The committee showed majority support in two of the six academic cuts — educational administration and textiles, merchandising and fashion design — albeit narrowly, while urging a pause.
A UNL spokesperson said moving forward with the cuts by the next regents meeting on Dec. 5 is important because “longer delays worsen the university’s cash position.” The advisory group said the university has time, because it might take up to 14 months to actually implement some of the academic cuts.
‘Let’s completely think it out’
John Shrader, president of the UNL Faculty Senate and a professor in sports media and communication, said he hopes all faculty senators take Lewis’ motion back to their respective units and consider how to make it better or suggest other action.
On the motion itself, Shrader said late Tuesday: “I really need to know more.”
“I think we’re in the ‘Let’s completely think it out stage,’” Shrader said.
Shrader said he has felt a “no confidence” vote needs to be the “absolute last resort” and that faculty need to fully think through the process first. He said he feels UNL and the university system have some leadership issues, but he said the Faculty Senate is trying to figure out what it can do to make the situation better.
Lewis, now in her 17th year as faculty, said she is open to changes to her motion and, like Shrader, wanted to give time for faculty to discuss the motion first with peers.
“Yes, there has to be effective institutional management,” Lewis said. “But there also has to be a certain level of duty of care that should be exhibited by the leadership of the university.”

Collins, who has been remembered as a trailblazer and for revolutionizing the state’s economy by bringing Toyota Motor Manufacturing to Kentucky for its first U.S. site, died Saturday, Nov. 1. She was 88.
Gov. Andy Beshear, who like Collins is a Democrat, announced during a Wednesday press conference that Collins will lie in state at the Old State Capitol in Frankfort on Sunday, Nov. 9. Members of the public may pay their respects between noon and 3 p.m. 
The current State Capitol is undergoing a multiyear renovation project and has been closed to visitors and employees. The Old State Capitol is at 300 West Broadway St. 
Beshear added that plans for a service to honor Collins are still underway. 
Beshear’s father, former Gov. Steve Beshear, served as lieutenant governor under Collins. The current governor recalled seeing Collins while she was in office and he was a kid. She later provided the younger Beshear with “good advice, a lot of support,” he continued.

But the GOP still has a strong hold on the Mississippi Legislature and can override Democrats on all but a few types of votes if they caucus, in both the House and Senate. 
In a reconfigured Senate district in northwestern Mississippi, voters elected Democrat Theresa Gillespie Isom over Republican Charlie Hoots. In another redrawn district in the Pine Belt region around Hattiesburg, Democrat Johnny DuPree defeated Republican Anna Rush. 
Republicans previously represented these two areas, but a federal court earlier this year determined the state violated the Voting Rights Act and ordered the state to redraw them into majority-Black districts. 
Mississippi 2025 special elections: See the results
Two Senate races, one in the Jackson area and one in the Delta, are still undecided because a Dec. 2 runoff will decide the winners, but they are not expected to further tilt partisan power.
In both of these races, the elections are nonpartisan, though the winner will likely declare a partisan affiliation after taking office. In both elections, the candidates are seeking to replace longtime Democratic senators. 
Mississippi had a mix of partisan and nonpartisan special elections Tuesday. Special elections are nonpartisan when an office holder leaves during a term. But in the elections for the redrawn districts, candidates ran with party labels.
State Rep. Cheikh Taylor of Starkville, chairman of the Mississippi Democratic Party, said Tuesday’s results show Mississippi can be a battleground state that is no longer “a foregone conclusion.” 
However, Taylor noted that the Democratic victories were only possible because federal judges found that Mississippi had violated the federal Voting Rights Act – something the U.S. Supreme Court may limit in the future. 
“If the Supreme Court dismantles these protections, we risk silencing the very voices that made last night’s historic outcome possible,” Taylor said. “As voters continue to reject Trump’s agenda in 2026 and 2027, we must protect the fundamental right that makes change possible: the right to vote.”
Republicans will have 34 senators, and Democrats will likely have 18 when the Mississippi Legislature convenes in January for its 2026 session. If the Senate strictly votes along party lines on an issue, Democrats could prevent Republicans from accomplishing a small number of things.
In Mississippi, it takes a two-thirds vote of both legislative chambers to suspend parliamentary rules and deadlines, amend the Mississippi Constitution and override a governor’s veto. 
Republicans still hold a three-fifths supermajority, which means they can make decisions about taxes without having any support from Democrats.

While Republicans will still control a significant portion of the legislative agenda over the next two years, Democrats could utilize these gains to prevent Republican leadership from reviving legislation that had died on key deadlines or block Republicans from amending parts of the state constitution. 
Heather Williams is president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, an organization that invested heavily in Mississippi’s elections. She celebrated the Tuesday victories and welcomed more Democrats to the Legislature. 
“Mississippians are sending a clear message that, from blue states to red states, voters are ready to stand up against Republicans’ extreme agenda and hold them accountable,” Williams said. 
Democrats also flipped a Republican seat in the House when Democrat Justin Crosby defeated Republican state Rep. Jon Lancaster in the Chickasaw County area of northeastern Mississippi. 
Tuesday’s elections mean that two more women will join the Senate in January.
Isom, elected from DeSoto County, won her election outright. In a special election to fill the seat vacated by Jackson Mayor John Horhn, two women, Letita Johnson and Kamesha Mumford, are advancing to the runoff.

(Photo by Ben Fenwick/Oklahoma Watch)When Tynesia Omopariola moved back to Oklahoma after living in Los Angeles for a decade, she thought she was getting such a break in rent from L.A.’s astronomical rates when she found Izzy Apartments in Oklahoma City.
With prices for a one-bedroom Los Angeles apartment typically exceeding $2,700 per month, Izzy’s rates seemed like a song at $890 for a two-bedroom, along with amenities she said she was promised, including a dishwasher, a stove, a refrigerator and washer and dryer. So, in she moved. And it went downhill from there.
“ I moved in February and I was promised all these amenities,” Omopariola said. “None of them worked or were even rectified until I would say August. Six months in, I put in many work orders.”
One of the most important amenities would be having an apartment that doesn’t flood, she said. Hers has since she moved in. It flooded so often that she eventually bought a shop vac to clear the water regularly.
“The maintenance crews have come over numerous times, but my apartment is still flooding,” she said. “ They know this. They don’t care. They’re just simply getting money in people’s money, in taking their deposits, taking their rent, and so many people are moving out.”
The flooding is so bad that her neighbor’s roof caved in, she said. The owners have not fixed the problem, so Omopariola did what any tenant would be able to in California: she refused to pay her rent until they fixed it.
“ I told them over and over, ‘I’m withholding the rent because of this and (because) I haven’t had the amenities,’” she said. “This will happen to my apartment (roof caving in). What’s going on with my apartment?”
That is how Omopariola ended up in Oklahoma County’s eviction court last week, with a forcible entry and detainer — an eviction notice — filed against her by one of the big three attorneys, Darquita Maggard, who filed more than 3,000 such actions last year.
Unlike most other states, tenants in Oklahoma do not have the right to withhold rent unless their apartment is fixed. It’s grounds for automatic eviction.
Eviction Fast Lane
Tulsa has reaped rewards from its Tulsa Remote program, which offers a $10,000 bonus to remote workers who move from another state to the city to work there. However, many moving from elsewhere might want to look into how Oklahoma’s landlord-tenant laws differ.
Oklahoma Policy Institute’s housing senior policy analyst, Sabine Brown, said that demands for repairs often land new, formerly out-of-state tenants on the curb.
“Tenants don’t have anti-retaliation protections in Oklahoma, and we’re one of only six states that doesn’t have that protection,” Brown said. “So what that means is if a tenant goes to their landlord and asks for repairs to address a health or safety concern like they have standing sewage or a leak, instead of getting that repaired, they could face increased rent, loss of their lease, increased fees, or worst case scenario, even eviction.”
Tulsa recently made a few gains in lowering its eviction rate when the court system there required that a notice for a tenant’s legal resources be stapled to eviction notices. However, even this approach is in many ways too late, especially for tenants who stop paying rent in an attempt to force their landlords to fix problems. After that eviction notice is filed, it becomes much harder to rent again, and can make that tenant’s next apartment far more difficult to obtain.
“An eviction filing is on your record for life,” Brown said. “I think that is an important point that people should know. An eviction filing, even one that is not granted, stays on your record forever. And when you have a housing market that is as tight as what we’re seeing currently, landlords are just not willing to rent to somebody with an eviction on their record.”
In Oklahoma County, that fact was not lost on Omopariola. She is a manager, with an MBA, and a previously clean rental record in Oklahoma. But not now.
”They’re not gonna honor their contract,” she said. “But then that looks bad on me because now I’ll have an eviction on my record and it’s way, way harder to get another apartment because of it.”
Stopping the Trap
The problem is pervasive enough that Oklahoma City University’s Tenant Advocacy Center has recently issued a flyer to its clients, warning them that they can’t just withhold rent, no matter how bad the situation is.
“Think You Don’t Have to Pay Rent Because of Repairs? Think Again,” the flyer warns. “You can’t stop paying rent just because your landlord hasn’t made repairs. You have the right to a safe and livable home, but you can be evicted if you continue to live there and don’t pay your rent.”

According to the flyer, tenants have two options: they can pay for the repairs themselves and take it from the next month’s rent, or they can give the landlord two weeks’ notice to fix the problem. If the landlord doesn’t fix it, they can move out.
But those remedies are trickier than they sound. For one, under Oklahoma law, the tenant must keep paying rent for the unit, even if there is a hole in the roof and water is pouring in, and while doing so, pay for the repairs. That tenant must also keep careful records. Then, the law states, the tenant can deduct the cost of those repairs, provided they do not exceed a full month’s rent.
Or, giving proper notice, move out. Which is the problem with the law, said Mikayla Friede, who until recently was the support staff team leader at Legal Aid Services Oklahoma. At her desk on the sixth floor of the Oklahoma County Courthouse, about 60% of the clients who walked in were dealing with the problem of rental unit repairs not being made by their landlord.
“ If they’re leveraging the only leverage they have, they don’t want to leave,” Friede said. “If they wanted to leave, they would’ve just left, right? The problem is the money doesn’t allow them to move, and the remedy doesn’t give them an option. That’s not an option. You can’t; most people aren’t in a position to move, particularly when they’re not expecting it out of the blue. We’re talking about all our clients being impoverished. They can’t just drop what they’re doing and move.”
The other option, instigating repair work on their own, is just as fraught. Already coming up with the rent for the month, they now have to initiate hundreds of dollars in repairs. Many don’t have that option. Few know they have to keep track of the expenses, carefully document them, then present them to a likely uncooperative landlord. Friede said that is the threshold at which many tenants decide to withhold rent and end up getting evicted.
“The frustrations that ultimately led to things to start a spiral started with repair issues going unaddressed,” Friede said. “Some, when they called initially, when they were in the repair issue phase, trying to find out what their legal rights were, they mentioned intending to withhold rent. Many of those I was able to stop. Unfortunately, I would put about half of our FEDs (forcible entry and detainer) for non-payment specifically for unrepaired or uncompleted repair issues.”
And those tenants usually are forced out of their apartments, she said.
“Not only are there limited remedies, you have to be very explicit to follow the law, or you will still end up evicted for not following the rule,” Friede said.
Amy Coldren, the director of advocacy and communication for Mental Health Association Oklahoma, which works with clients to help prevent evictions, said the repair/rent withholding issue is a major problem for tenants struggling to keep their homes.
”Oklahoma has really complicated laws,” Coldren said. “A lot of tenants incorrectly believe that they can withhold rent if a repair request has not been made. But there is a very specific process that you have to do with a certain timeline and certified letters and all of this. And so if you go to court and you say, ‘I stopped paying my rent because I haven’t had hot water,’ or ‘I haven’t had heat,’ or, or whatever it is …, if you did not go through those steps, then there’s really nothing the judge can do.”
And those records have to be closely followed. In Omopariola’s case, she knew that she couldn’t withhold rent to get her apartment repaired.
“I also spoke with them about it,” Omopariola said. “They discussed rent concessions for that.”
The deal with that manager held. But then the complex changed managers. And then changed again.
“They changed management like four times even since I’ve been there myself,” she said. “And so then a new person will come and say, ‘Well, I don’t know. Did we really say that? Well, how much?’ And then it’s a different story.”
Friede said Omopariola’s case is not unusual.
“ And based on the (rental) agreement, she’s non-compliant,” Mikayla said.
Izzy Apartments, owned by Candlewood Realty LLC, refused comment.
Destructive Animals
Evandra Coleman knew she’d had it with her landlord after the racoon fell through the hole in the ceiling and trashed her daughter’s room trying to get back out.
Sitting on a bench on the sixth floor of the Oklahoma County Courthouse, outside the courtroom where most eviction hearings are held, Coleman clutched the file she had compiled, including photos she’d taken of the hole in her ceiling. In the succession of images taken over several months, the pictures show the hole, which started as only a water stain, but then grow larger and larger with the passing weeks. Finally, she showed one that revealed the tiny, hand-like paw of the unwanted nocturnal visitor.
Subsequent photos showed the wreck of her six-year-old daughter’s room caused by the racoon, who dropped in unexpectedly at 2 a.m. Now, because of her daughter’s nightmares, and the mold, the two have taken to sleeping in the living room.

“ I went to the office at the beginning of September because again,” she pointed to a notice from her landlord, “that’s what this balance here is reflecting. And I was telling her, me and my daughter were sick and we were having migraines and not feeling well. And I was like, I don’t know if it’s from the black mold. ’cause we were, we like to camp out in our living room ’cause and since we’ve been living there, we haven’t done that.”
Sick, she missed work and came up short on the rent. And now, like Omopariola, she found herself in Oklahoma County’s eviction court.
For now, Coleman said, her backup plan is for her and her daughter to move in with her brother and sleep on his couch. At least she won’t be on the street and can look for a new place to live while keeping a roof over her and her daughter’s heads. It would also be good because she could move away from where the mold was making her and her daughter sick.
She looked down at the photos in her file, and the tears flowed.
“It’s not fair,” she said, quietly sobbing outside the courtroom. “It’s not fair.”
It was her eighth time in eviction court, all but one filed by Maggard at Coleman’s previous residence. This time, no attorney was listed. Coleman was able to be represented by Legal Aid Services attorney Lynn Williams.
Court records show her case was continued.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear is sending the National Guard to staff food banks while more than 600,000 in the state await federal food assistance during the ongoing government shutdown. 
This comes days after Beshear sent $5 million from the state’s “rainy day fund” to Feeding Kentucky, a network of food banks, and tasked the organization with buying more food during delays in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. 
In October, 645,461 used SNAP benefits to buy groceries in Kentucky. Those people are turning to food banks, which were already stretched thin in meeting the needs of a state with high rates of food insecurity and are now seeing even more visitors. 
“What this means is that every dollar we’re providing to the food banks can go towards purchasing the food, and that we can provide the extra staffing that’s needed as they see a surge of families coming in,” Beshear said during a Wednesday press conference. “It will help ensure Feeding Kentucky and their partner food banks can focus on distributing meals without the hardship of finding additional staff.” 
The Lantern has asked Feeding Kentucky for comment on this move. 
Uncertainty has swirled around SNAP benefits as the U.S. government’s longest-ever shutdown continues into November. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said in late October that it would not use contingency funds to keep SNAP benefits flowing, which left 42 million Americans to face uncertainty about how to afford groceries on Nov. 1. 
Beshear joined other Democrats in suing over the decision, and several judges have said that the Trump administration can’t block the funds. Beshear then declared a state of emergency and directed $5 million from the state’s budget reserve trust fund to food banks that are part of the Feeding Kentucky network. 
The USDA announced on Monday it will pay about half of November SNAP benefits, but they could take a while to make it to recipients’ hands, States Newsroom’s D.C. Bureau reported.
Then, on Tuesday, President Donald Trump posted on social media that SNAP benefits “will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!” 
Beshear said Wednesday that his administration “received confirmation from the federal government that they will begin processing payments” on Thursday.  
“Kentucky is ready, willing and able to work around the clock as quickly as possible once funding is received,” he said. “It’s important to remember SNAP benefits are typically staggered through the month, and therefore payments will be too, but I can assure you, our teams will be working day and night to make it happen.”

Democratic candidates on Tuesday night appeared to have gained three Mississippi legislative seats, which included toppling a Republican incumbent in a special general election.
Second-term state Rep. Jon Lancaster, a Republican from Houston, trailed behind his Democratic challenger, Justin Crosby, on Tuesday.
Crosby, a political newcomer, received 2,767 votes to Lancaster’s 2,477, according to incomplete results with all precincts reporting but at least some absentee ballots uncounted. The race included parts of Chickasaw, Monroe and Clay counties.

The final vote talies can change because local election officials can process absentee ballots for up to five days after the election.
Democrat Johny DuPree, a former Hattiesburg mayor and unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate, defeated Republican Anna Rush, an attorney, in a Senate race that included parts Forrest and Lamar counties.
Democrat Theresa Isom also defeated Republican Charlie Hoots in a Senate district that included portions of DeSoto and Tunica Counties.
Each district where Democrats gained seats was in an area where a federal court ordered lawmakers to redraw lines to make majority-Black districts.
Though Democrats made inroads in the state, several Republican incumbents successfully fended off Democratic challengers.
In the DeSoto County area, Republican Sen. Michael McLendon of Hernando and Republican Kevin Blackwell of Southaven won their elections. Republican Sen. Chris Johnson of Hattiesburg also defeated his Democratic opponent.
In Senate district 11, Democratic Sen. Reginald Jackson of Marks was leading his Republican opponent, Kendall Prewett, but Coahoma County on Tuesday night did not report complete results to Mississippi Today.
Of 14 total elections, seven seats were not contested, either because only one candidate filed to run in the race or because the candidate did not have any opposition in the general election.
But seven races related to redistricting were contested in the general election: six in the Senate and one in the House.
No matter the outcome of Tuesday’s races, Republicans will still retain control of both chambers of the 174-member Legislature when lawmakers convene in January for their 2026 session. However, national Democratic organizations hoped to end the GOP’s two-thirds supermajority control of the state Senate on Tuesday.
Unrelated to the redistricting lawsuit, voters in parts of the Delta and the Jackson metro area participated in special legislative elections on Tuesday because of incumbents vacating their seats.
Sen. David Jordan, a Democrat from Greenwood whose district includes portions of Leflore, Panola and Tallahatchie counties, retired over the summer, and six candidates are vying to replace him.
No candidate in the race received an outright majority of the votes cast, which means the top two candidates in the race will advance to a runoff election. As of Tuesday night, Curressia Brown and Justin Pope received the largest share of the votes.
Kamesha Mumford and Letitia Johnson will also advance to a runoff to fill Jackson Mayor John Horhn’s old seat in Senate District 26 in parts of Hinds and Madison counties.
Voters in Bolivar, Coahoma and Sunflower counties are choosing a new representative for House District 26 after Orlando Paden was elected mayor of Clarksdale. Final results were not in from Coahoma County, but it appeared Otha Williams was the winner, based on social media posts from him and other candidates.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AR-Election-Day-Huntsville-110524-13-1024x585.jpg,,,2025-11-05 12:03:15.577012

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)When Winsome Earle-Sears — who lost to Democrat Abigail Spanberger by nearly 15 points Tuesday — became the first Black woman nominated for governor of Virginia by a major political party, history took note. Her image — poised, confident, gun in hand — was hailed by some as proof that the Republican Party was evolving. 
But for many in Virginia’s Black community, the moment landed not with applause, but with solemn reflection. Because in our history, “firsts” have never been about optics. They have been about legacy, sacrifice and duty.
Democrats sweep Virginia’s statewide races, reclaiming full control of executive branch

For Black Americans, a “first” carries sacred weight. It represents generations who were denied the vote, the job, the education, the opportunity. Our firsts have always stood on the shoulders of those who came before — rooted in church life, raised through civic sisterhoods like The Links or the National Council of Negro Women, or one of the Divine Nine Greek-letter organizations steeped in the ethos of collective uplift. They did not ascend alone. They rose carrying their people with them.
Earle-Sears did not come from that lineage, nor did her campaign reflect it. Her politics were shaped not by the moral traditions of the Black community, but by a movement increasingly defined by grievance and exclusion. She often spoke as if detached from the struggle that made her rise possible. She chose the posture of independence over interdependence, the symbolism of being “the first” over the responsibility that comes with it.
Representation matters. But representation without empathy or accountability becomes performance. Earle-Sears’ campaign leaned heavily on the imagery of her identity — a Jamaican immigrant, a Marine, a barrier-breaker — while offering little policy substance for those whose votes and futures she sought to represent. She did not address the racial wealth gap, health disparities, sentencing bias, or the inequities in housing and education that shape Black life in this commonwealth.
Where was the agenda for working-class Virginians? For Black entrepreneurs seeking access to capital? For families trapped by high rents and low wages? For the preservation of Black cemeteries and museums that anchor our heritage? These were not her priorities. Instead, she wielded her immigrant identity as a way to separate herself from the very people who paved the road she walked. She played identity politics in reverse; she used her background and presence as a Black woman not to unite, but to distance.
That choice cut deep. Because a true first never forgets she is the product of her people’s prayers and persistence. A first who does not carry her community with her is not a bridge, she is an island.
Virginia knows the difference between symbolism and substance. 
In 1951, a 16-year-old girl named Barbara Johns led a student strike in Farmville to protest the separate and unequal conditions of her segregated school. Her courage helped ignite the legal fight that culminated in Brown v. Board of Education. Next year, her statue will stand in the U.S. Capitol’s Statuary Hall, replacing one of a Confederate general. That is what a true first looks like: a young Black woman whose moral clarity and collective courage changed the course of a nation.
Johns’ story echoes the legacy of Shirley Chisholm, another daughter of Jamaica, who became the first Black woman elected to Congress in 1968, representing New York. Chisholm’s motto —“Unbought and unbossed”— was not about personal defiance. It was about fearless advocacy for the people of Bedford-Stuyvesant, for women, for workers, for the voiceless. She, like Johns, understood that being first was never about her; it was about those who would come next.
And lest we forget the first woman vice president of the United States of America, Kamala Harris,  a mixed race Black woman of South Asian and Jamaican heritage. (In full disclosure, she is also our sorority sister.) Harris’ background, career and candidacy represent the legacy of service over self and collective over individual that defines a true “first” for our community. 
After 235 years, America still isn’t ready for President Kamala Harris

Historically, Black women who reached high office have done so with that same sense of stewardship. When Mary McLeod Bethune founded a college, when Barbara Jordan entered Congress, when Kamala Harris took the oath as Vice President, they knew the world was watching not only what they achieved, but who they served. “When and where I enter,” wrote pioneering Black educator and author Anna Julia Cooper, “the race enters with me.”
That is the sacred charge of a first, to walk through the door in such a way that others may follow. To expand the circle of belonging, not narrow it.
The tragedy of Earle-Sears’ campaign was not simply that she lost, but that she squandered a rare opportunity. A Black woman atop a statewide ticket in Virginia — the former capital of the Confederacy — could have been a profound moment of unity. She could have spoken to the pain and promise of our shared past, embodying the bridge between history and hope.
Instead, she chose combat over compassion, condescension over connection, and silence where solidarity was needed most. She mistook proximity to power for progress. And in doing so, she reminded us that not every “first” is a victory. Some are a warning.
True firsts do not stand apart from their people; they rise because of them. They understand that being first is not about being exceptional — it’s about being accountable. It is not about proving that “anyone can make it” in America; it is about ensuring that everyone can. The celebration of a first is sacred because it honors generations who opened doors with their blood, sweat and brilliance. To claim that mantle while standing with those who would close those doors is not triumph, it is betrayal.
As Black women, scholars, and Virginians, we do not write this to chastise, but to clarify. 
Earle-Sears’ candidacy was a missed opportunity for reconciliation, a moment when symbolism could have become substance. The next “first” must do more than wear our skin. She must carry our story. She must be grounded in the moral soil of our shared struggle, speak to the needs of the least of these, and remember that freedom is never individual; it is always collective.
That is the meaning — and the duty — of a true first.

The measure asked voters if they would like the town select board to explore the possibility of applying for a municipal bond of up to $1 million to help fund the project. The local ballot explained that it was a “non-binding, advisory vote” for the town board to consider whether to move forward, but it still failed by a vote of 276 to 366, according to results provided by the town clerk. 
Though voters were not interested in a municipal bond, the Moosehead Caring for Kids Foundation, Greenville Consolidated School and the town have already raised $3 million for the project that’s known as the YES (Youth, Education and Sport) building, including from federal funds back in 2023. 
Child care access is an issue not only in the town, which is located on the southern tip of Moosehead Lake, but across the state. 
Maine families are wrestling with a dire lack of child care options, particularly in more rural areas like Piscataquis County, where Greenville is located. There are 16 registered providers in the county, two of which are located in Greenville. However, neither had openings based on the latest available data from May.

In a race that held all the suspense of a 1970s-era Soviet election, Michelle Wu was returned to office for a second term yesterday in an election where she was the only name on Boston’s mayoral ballot. It followed a September preliminary contest that looked more like a Harlem Globetrotters exhibition, with Wu running circles around Josh Kraft, who seemed less threatening challenger than hapless foil, against whom she could run up the score.  
For the real bare-knuckle action in mayoral contests these days, you need to look outside the state’s capital city, where incumbents don’t just often face serious challenges, but lose with some regularity. The odds certainly heavily favor incumbent officeholders, but more than a dozen Massachusetts mayors have lost their seats over the last decade.  
Yesterday, it was in Everett and Gloucester that voters chose change.  
Everett’s swaggering longtime mayor, Carlo DeMaria, who has presided over a development boom anchored by his city’s welcoming of the state’s biggest casino, seems to have overplayed his hand.  
The state inspector general ruled earlier this year that the 17-year incumbent had inappropriately schemed to be awarded “longevity” bonuses, taking in an extra $180,000 that he hid from public view. Vowing to bring transparency to city government, City Councilor Robert Van Campen beat DeMaria by 9 percentage points – 54 percent to 46 percent – according to unofficial results posted by the city election department.  
In Gloucester, Greg Verga, who himself ousted an incumbent to become mayor four years ago, got a taste of the same restive-voter medicine, as former city councilor Paul Lundberg trounced him by about 15 points. Verga presided over the city during a divisive teachers strike a year ago, a tense time for the North Shore city that he seemed to further inflame when he was caught on video flipping the bird to a group of picketing teachers.  
In Boston, it’s been more than 75 years since an incumbent mayor was ousted, and even then it took a federal prison stay on mail fraud charges for voters to finally show the colorful, but corrupt, James Michael Curley the door.  
Under the city’s strong-mayor charter, and with a built-in base of thousands of city workers, incumbent Boston mayors have largely cruised to reelection since Curley’s fateful fall in 1949. 
Compounding the advantage for Wu has been the increasing nationalization of local politics, a development she has played as deftly as her piano rendition of Mozart’s Concerto No. 21 before a dazzled crowd two years ago at Symphony Hall.  
Wu, who campaigned four years ago on a vow to remake the city’s development process and other nitty-gritty municipal matters, has not turned any miracles during her first term. The problems spilling out from Mass. and Cass persist. Boston schools continue to struggle with abysmal student achievement. But she has become a forceful national voice against the Trump administration, a political home run in a city where the MAGA brand is toxic.  
That reached its zenith last March when an unflappable Wu more than held her own against Republican House members who had beckoned her to Washington hoping to inflict a congressional beatdown on “sanctuary city” mayors.  
Wu has eagerly embraced the framing of the race as a referendum on what direction the country should take, including in her remarks to supporters last night.  
“This year, against the backdrop of a federal administration’s chaos and cruelty, we faced a choice: Cave to the pressure, backtrack, and change course, or double down on the values that founded our nation,” she said in her victory speech. “That’s what’s at stake. That is what this election was about here in Boston.”  
Her glide path to reelection stood in sharp contrast to the tough battles that played out in other mayoral races.  
The politics of managing smaller cities can quite literally be more of a contact sport. “There’s nowhere for a mayor of a small to mid-sized city to hide,” said Ed Lambert, who served six terms as mayor of Fall River in the 1990s and early 2000s. “You‘re walking the same streets, you’re shopping in the same places, you’re dining in the same places.” 
He said the challenges are even greater because those communities often lack the resources and tax base that Boston has, making it a constant struggle to deliver basic services while also trying to chart a broader vision for the city’s future.  
He recalled co-hosting a fundraiser while in office for Barney Frank, the former Newton congressman whose district included a chunk of Fall River. He said Frank, in his remarks, contrasted serving in Congress to the much more hands-on job of mayor.  
Frank said constituents might go months without thinking about what he was doing on their behalf in Congress. “But he said there can be three reasons to hate your mayor before nine in the morning,” Lambert recalled, if the snow wasn’t plowed, the trash not picked up on time, or your property tax bill just arrived in the mail. 
“If you love your city, it’s a great job,” said Lambert. “It’s a level of personal politics that can be incredibly rewarding – and challenging.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/20240109_200731-scaled-e1704861388612.jpg?fit=1024%2C717&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-05 12:03:15.577012

State Reps. Tyrone Carter and Karen Whitsett, both Detroit Democrats, will finish out their terms in the Michigan House after losing their council races. 
Unofficial results show that Carter fell to incumbent Gabriela Santiago-Romero in District 6 by roughly a 60% to 40% margin, and Whitsett lost to Denzel McCampbell in District 7, 64% to 36%.
Mary Sheffield makes history: Detroit elects first woman mayor

Santiago-Romero and McCampbell were endorsed by the Michigan Working Families Party, which said the outcome reflected Detroiters’ desire for change.
“They’re tired of leaders who are disconnected from the pressures that working people are facing every day, and who put corporate donors ahead of their needs,” Branden Snyder, the party’s state director, said in a statement Wednesday.
Meanwhile, incumbents Mary Waters and Coleman A. Young II retained their at-large City Council seats.
In other municipal elections of interest, Adam Alharbi holds a tenuous 11 vote margin over Muhith Mahmood in the race to become mayor of Hamtramck, 2,009 to 1,998. But that race remains too close to call, with dozens of rejected ballots potentially changing the result as voters are given an opportunity to correct mistakes, including missing signatures and signatures that didn’t match.
In Dearborn, Mayor Abdullah Hammoud secured a second term in a landslide, taking nearly 72% of the vote over challenger Nagi Almudhegi. 
Voters there also rejected a proposed charter amendment to create a ward system for the city council, with 70.8% voting “no.”
Not to be outdone in Lansing, Mayor Andy Schor easily won re-election with 66% of the vote, defeating challenger Kelsea Hector, who garnered 33%.

(Photo provided by the Alaska National Guard)On Wednesday, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game will open an emergency moose hunt in Southwest Alaska, near the town of Quinhagak, in order to help victims of Typhoon Halong, which devastated communities in the Yukon-Kuskokwim delta last month.
It’s the second emergency hunt that Fish and Game has opened to help storm victims refill their freezers before winter deepens, and it’s only the latest example of how Alaska state agencies have helped in unlikely ways after last month’s disaster, which killed at least one person and displaced hundreds.
Elsewhere, officials from the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development have been coordinating new schools for evacuees who needed to move to Bethel or Anchorage. 
The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation has been helping wrangle fuel tanks set adrift in floods. Workers from the Division of Forestry and Fire Protection have been helping muck out homes, remove debris and deliver supplies to villages alongside the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities and the Alaska National Guard. 
In Anchorage, hundreds of miles away from the villages hardest hit by the storm, about 20 employees of the state-owned Alaska Housing Finance Corporation worked for weeks to find long-term shelter for hundreds of Alaskans who lost their homes in the disaster.
On Monday, state and city officials in Anchorage said they had closed the last mass shelters being used by evacuees because everyone had found hotels or apartments suitable for long-term use.
“This isn’t something we normally have done,” said AHFC CEO/Executive Director Bryan Butcher on Oct. 22 of the push to help evacuees find housing. “There have been different times … that people have reached out to us and asked for assistance, and we try to help when we can.”
Butcher said AHFC employees spent time checking for available state-owned housing and tried to connect evacuees with available apartments and housing across the state.
“We’ll play whatever role we need to play,” he said in late October. “And at this point, it’s just the gathering of units and then trying to help kind of piece it together so it makes the most sense and has the least amount of disruption.”
At the Department of Fish and Game, Ryan Scott is the director of the Division of Wildlife Conservation, which oversees hunting practices and issued the emergency hunting order this week.
“Our staff has been in communication with the communities, plus people who evacuated to town. And you know, I’m very proud of them, but I’m super thankful that we could help out where we could,” he said.
Scott said the department frequently gets requests for emergency hunts, but they’re only allowed in places where the population of prey animals is large enough to support them.
While the two emergency hunts in Southwest Alaska are intended to help people affected by the disaster, any state resident can participate if they meet the guidelines. 
The food generated by the hunt may even be able to help people who evacuated from the area; Alaska has a system of proxy hunting that allows someone to hunt on behalf of someone else who is elderly or disabled. 
In addition, evacuees may be able to take advantage of winter hunts or small-game hunts, or other subsistence activities, Scott said.
“We get into this type of work not only for the wildlife resources, but across the board it’s about the people too, you know? And then whatever we can do to help Alaskans, that’s what we want to do.”

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)As nighttime temperatures begin to dip near freezing, the Maine State Housing Authority said it has found a temporary solution for the uncertainty over how home heating assistance will be provided during the ongoing federal government shutdown.
MaineHousing announced Wednesday that it will issue an initial round of Home Energy Assistance Program payments for households that have already been deemed eligible, which should capture those most in need, using funds left over from last year. This comes after a coalition of community action organizations, which help administer the aid, said last week that payments would be delayed since the federal dollars that support the program had not yet been allocated. 
“As MaineHousing — like many other agencies and individuals — continues to await the end of the federal government shutdown, it was critical that we do what we can to help alleviate the stress, anxiety, and hardship this prolonged shutdown is causing here in Maine,” said MaineHousing Director Dan Brennan.
The Home Energy Assistance Program, also referred to as the low-income home energy assistance program or LIHEAP, provides funds to assist low-income homeowners and renters to cover a portion of their heating costs. It supported over 38,000 Maine households last year.
Congress has been locked in a stalemate over a stopgap spending bill, so it did not appropriate money for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. 
However, MaineHousing said Wednesday morning that households that applied in August and September could see benefits over the next several weeks. Applications for households with older residents, young children or other vulnerable populations are prioritized when they are received, so using these funds for those earlier applications should capture those with the most need, Brennan said.
MaineHousing’s temporary solution, using leftover funds initially slated for two of the agency’s other programs, will provide $2.2 million to help roughly 4,000 households.
“Borrowing funds from one program to pay for another is certainly not ideal and is not a long-term solution,” Brennan said. “These programs will be repaid once the federal government reopens and Maine’s HEAP grant is released. By taking this step now, as winter approaches, we hope that at least some of our most vulnerable households will be able to avoid a heating emergency.”
Applications will continue to be processed through November, but those households will not be able to receive funds until the federal government reopens. Congress will then need to release Maine’s share of HEAP, which is about $40 million annually. Roughly $26 million of that is allocated directly to eligible households for fuel assistance while the remainder is used to administer the program and support related initiatives. 
Without heating assistance, the community action partnership said last week that Mainers may be forced to rely on unsafe methods of staying warm — such as using kitchen ovens or burning wood in poorly ventilated stoves.
Though it has been trending downward, more than half of Maine households still relied on oil as their primary heating source last year.
However, a separate fund that provides emergency aid to Maine households facing an imminent heating crisis will remain on hold until federal dollars are available.
The $3 million Energy Crisis Intervention Program did not begin on Nov. 1, as it typically does each year, due to the shutdown. That program serves about 7,000 households annually by providing $500 in emergency heating assistance to eligible recipients of HEAP benefits, according to MaineHousing.
The Maine Department of Energy Resources released a Winter Heating Guide to help people stay warm and find support, if needed. 
The pause in heating assistance comes as the nation’s largest food assistance program is also set to lapse this month. A federal judge on Saturday ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to tap its contingency funds to provide food assistance for 42 million Americans, but the Trump administration is refusing, backtracking on its initial agreement to issue partial payments. 
“The prolonged federal shutdown has created an environment where vulnerabilities are being pitted against one another,” said Victoria Forkus, managing director of Maine Community Action Partnership. “We believe every Mainer deserves to be warm, fed, housed, and supported with dignity.”

California voters on Tuesday passed a ballot measure to redraw the state’s congressional map to favor Democrats, a major victory for the party in a high-stakes national redistricting fight that could determine who controls the House of Representatives next year.
The Associated Press called the race shortly after polls closed at 8 p.m. Early returns showed the measure leading with nearly 65% of the vote.
The maps voters approved with Proposition 50 make it likely that five of California’s GOP-held congressional seats could be won by Democrats in next year’s midterm elections. They also bolster the re-election chances of three Democrats currently holding office in now-competitive districts.
The passage is a triumph for Gov. Gavin Newsom, an early proponent of the gerrymandering plan whose backing set off a whirlwind summer map-drawing effort and quick passage through the Democratic-dominated state Legislature.
The campaign played out as a rebuke to President Donald Trump, and Newsom reaffirmed that message in a short speech at the Sacramento headquarters of the California Democratic Party.
“We stood tall and we stood firm in response to Donald Trump’s recklessness. Tonight, after poking the bear, this bear roared, with unprecedented turnout in a special election with an extraordinary result,” Newsom said.
But he cautioned people to not let down their guard, warning that Trump will continue to intimidate people by deploying ICE and the Border Patrol in cities and to try to gain more congressional seats in other red states. Trump early Tuesday morning claimed without evidence the vote was “rigged” and vowed a “legal and criminal review” of the election.
After weeks of saying only that other Democratic-led states could consider redistricting in a similar way, Newsom explicitly called on Virginia, Maryland, New York, Illinois and Colorado to put up a show of force against Trump and help win back the House.
“I hope it’s dawning on people the sobriety of this moment, what’s at stake,” he said. “We can de facto end Donald Trump’s presidency as we know it … We all must contribute.”
Charles Munger Jr., the lead funder of the ‘No’ on Prop. 50 campaign, said he was saddened by the outcome but would keep working toward independent redistricting nationwide.
“I oppose partisan gerrymandering in any state, regardless of the party initiating it,” he said in a statement.
Nationally, the gains would effectively cancel out the five seats the GOP sought to gain in Texas by passing a new congressional map earlier this year at Trump’s urging, and weakens Trump’s efforts to solidify the GOP’s slim majority in the House. If Democrats win those seats, they would have more power to challenge Trump’s administration and policies. However, it has also set off an escalating tit-for-tat around the country as more states move to gerrymander in response to, or against, the president.
But no other states have the population or congressional seats of Texas or California, making Prop. 50’s passage especially significant for control of the House.
His campaign drew upon an army of community groups and volunteers that had last mobilized in an off-year election to support him in the failed Republican effort to recall him from office four years ago; polling close to Election Day showed nearly the same share of voters supporting the measure as supporting Newsom during the 2021 recall. Along the way, the governor has made a name for himself nationally as one of the few Democrats willing to try unconventional approaches to oppose Trump after suffering bruising losses last fall.
The measure was bemoaned by some good government advocates who supported then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s ballot initiative to get California voters to approve an independent, nonpartisan redistricting system that has since become a standard for good governance nationwide. Prop. 50 sets aside the independent commission that drew the current congressional map for the next six years; California will return to using the commission after the 2030 Census.
But despite the commission’s popularity, most Democrats, who outnumber Republicans nearly two-to-one in voter registration, agreed with Newsom’s argument that they needed to “fight fire with fire” in response to Trump’s unprecedented push for mid-decade gerrymandering in Texas and other red states.
More than 6.6 million ballots — about 29% of those who received mail-in ballots — were already returned before Election Day, according to Political Data Inc., which tracks ballots in each county. Final polling showed strong support for Prop. 50, with 56% of likely voters telling the Public Policy Institute of California they were in favor and 60% of likely voters supporting it in a Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies survey.
The new maps will dramatically alter next year’s midterm elections, which were predicted to feature several highly competitive races in California.
Some disparate parts of the state will get lumped together, such as a wacky shaped district in the North State that combines rural and conservative Modoc County with the ultra-liberal Bay Area in Marin County. The city of Huntington Beach, a conservative stronghold in Orange County that banned the LGBTQ pride flag on city property, would be represented by a progressive, gay Peruvian immigrant, the top Democrat on the U.S. House’s primary investigative committee.
And a game of musical chairs in San Diego and Riverside counties could pit longtime Republican members of Congress against one another as the number of winnable GOP seats shrinks. Several salivating Democrats have already declared they will run in the newly formed, Democratic-friendly 48th Congressional District, which Republican Rep. Darrell Issa currently represents.
In the weeks leading up to Election Day, voters in the typically low-turnout Central Valley proved that even though many Californians hadn’t heard of Prop. 50 by name, the redistricting issue was familiar enough that they could quickly form an opinion after learning about the measure.

(Photos by Ed Murray for New Jersey Monitor)The seven-person race to become Jersey City’s next mayor will be decided by a two-person runoff next month when James Solomon, a city councilman, will vie for the job against former Gov. Jim McGreevey.
The Dec. 2 runoff was triggered because no candidate received more than 50% of the vote. Solomon was the top vote-getter, receiving 29% of the vote, and McGreevey came in second place with 25%.
“The voters in Jersey City have sent an unambiguous message tonight: they want change, they want affordability and they want a clean, ethical government that they can be proud of,” Solomon said in a statement.

Speaking to supporters Tuesday night, McGreevey, who is eyeing a political comeback more than two decades after he resigned in disgrace as governor, said life has taught him “the things worth fighting for aren’t always easy.” 
“Part of the challenge here tonight and part of the challenge before Jersey City is, what kind of city do we want, and what kind of leader in our mayor do we need?” McGreevey said. 
More than 59,000 Jersey City voters cast ballots in the race. Solomon received 17,200 votes and McGreevey nabbed about 15,000.
Both men are Democrats. The municipal races in Jersey City are nonpartisan.
Two other mayoral hopefuls, Hudson County Commissioner Bill O’Dea and Mussab Ali, a former school board president, each received over 10,000 votes.
Solomon and McGreevey will be vying to replace Steve Fulop, a Democrat and the city’s three-term mayor. Fulop, who opted not to seek reelection after launching an ultimately failed bid for the Democratic nomination for governor this year, leaves office in December. He is taking a job leading business group the Partnership for New York City.

Democratic candidate Dr. David Chess defeated Republican mayoral incumbent Laura Hoydick.
Marvin Pittman was among the voters who trickled out of Stratford High School on Election Day after casting their ballots. Pittman said he voted for Chess, who he believes represents a fresh start for the town.
“I think that there’s more of a focus on trying to build something that’s sustainable, as well as serving some business interests, but really about still keeping things affordable for people here,” Pittman said.
Chess declared victory Tuesday night, although vote counts weren’t available as of 11 p.m. from the Secretary of the State’s website.
Stratford was one of the top-performing municipalities in the state for early voting, which local Democrats say gave Chess an advantage.
Chess said many throughout town are receptive to his message, focusing on economic and housing development. He says he’s able to connect with residents by sharing his history as a business owner and physician, having founded his own medical group.

“I think I’m going to be mayor very shortly,” Chess said earlier in the day Tuesday. “I’m feeling very good about this. I really believe in our message, and I know people believe in our message.”
Hoydick did not respond to requests for comment.
But other voters and Republican officials, such as Republican Town Council candidate Patty Gallahger, defended Hoydick’s record on redevelopment and taxes.
“She’s been able to stabilize taxes, and no increases, I think our economic development is doing really great, we have some really great projects that are going on,” Gallagher said.
Stratford resident Joanne Litzie is among local Democrats who voted for Hoydick.
“I have been happy with Laura,” Litzie said. “I’d like to see her be a little more progressive, but I trust her, so I’m sticking with her.”
Lt. Governor Susan Bysiewicz and U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro were among those political figures who stopped by the Stratford High School polling location Tuesday to support Chess.
Bysiewicz said early voting turnout will be crucial for Chess to win.
“I’m confident because Democrats have showed up in a big way early, but I’m also confident just because I know the ground game and the field organization that they have, and because he has knocked on over 5,000 doors,” Bysiewicz said.

This story was originally published by CalMatters.
California voters on Tuesday passed a ballot measure to redraw the state’s congressional map to favor Democrats, a major victory for the party in a high-stakes national redistricting fight that could determine who controls the U.S. House of Representatives next year.
The Associated Press called the race shortly after polls closed at 8 p.m. Early returns showed the measure leading with nearly 65% of the vote.
The maps voters approved with Proposition 50 make it likely that five of California’s GOP-held congressional seats could be won by Democrats in next year’s midterm elections. They also bolster the re-election chances of three Democrats currently holding office in now-competitive districts.
The passage is a triumph for Gov. Gavin Newsom, an early proponent of the gerrymandering plan whose backing set off a whirlwind summer map-drawing effort and quick passage through the Democratic-dominated state Legislature.
The campaign played out as a rebuke to President Donald Trump, and Newsom reaffirmed that message in a short speech at the Sacramento headquarters of the California Democratic Party.
“We stood tall and we stood firm in response to Donald Trump’s recklessness. Tonight, after poking the bear, this bear roared, with unprecedented turnout in a special election with an extraordinary result,” Newsom said.
But he cautioned people to not let down their guard, warning that Trump will continue to intimidate people by deploying ICE and the Border Patrol in cities and to try to gain more congressional seats in other red states. Trump early Tuesday morning claimed without evidence the vote was “rigged” and vowed a “legal and criminal review” of the election.
After weeks of saying only that other Democratic-led states could consider redistricting in a similar way, Newsom explicitly called on Virginia, Maryland, New York, Illinois and Colorado to put up a show of force against Trump and help win back the House.

(Photo courtesy of Ørsted)Revolution Wind is back on track, but the monthlong pause prompted by the Trump administration continues to ripple down the project developer’s balance sheet, according to third-quarter earnings reported Wednesday.
Ørsted A/S, the Danish renewable energy company co-developing the project, ended the three-month period $261.8 million in the red, a marked reversal from the $795 million profit for the same period a year ago. The losses stem in large part from depreciating value of the company’s U.S. projects due to rising tariffs and federal anti-wind policies, including a $76.9 million impairment recorded on the Revolution Wind project.
The depreciation in project value is directly tied to a stop work order unexpectedly handed down in August by federal regulators over concerns with national security. The 65 turbines being built 15 nautical miles south of Rhode Island were already 80% complete with final federal approval secured in November 2023. Inked agreements in 2019 committed the developer to sell power to Rhode Island and Connecticut utilities by 2027.
Ørsted made no secret of the financial consequences of the stop work order, detailing $2 million in daily losses on installation and manufacturing contracts in its federal lawsuit challenging the Trump administration. A second lawsuit filed by attorneys general in Rhode Island and Connecticut also sought to overturn the stop work order based on the environmental and economic harms to the states.
Ørsted’s lawsuit progressed faster, with a Sept. 22 preliminary injunction from a federal judge in D.C. allowing work to resume, at least temporarily. A similar decision remains pending in the AGs’ lawsuit in Rhode Island federal court.
The still tenuous legal and political circumstances underscoring the $5 billion project were front and center during an 80-minute call Wednesday. Investors and analysts had questions: What happens if the Trump administration appeals the court order? Is there any merit to security concerns? What if the legal challenge has not been resolved by the time the project is finished?

Company executives remained tight-lipped in their answers, acknowledging the potential for more obstacles from the Trump administration but refusing to disclose details on the company’s strategy beyond that it is pursuing both legal recourse and negotiations with federal regulators. 
Rasmus Errboe, Ørsted CEO and president, dismissed the idea that the developer would abandon the project.
“We have come so far on Revolution, the commitment is there,” he said. 
Anticipating financial fallout across its U.S. portfolio, the company initiated a heavily discounted share sale in early September, raising $9.4 billion in a rights issue that closed Oct. 3. On Monday, the company unveiled a deal to sell half the rights to an under-construction British offshore wind project, Hornsea 3, to a New York management company for $6.1 billion. 
“We’ve significantly strengthened Ørsted’s financial robustness with the completion of the rights issue and the agreement to divest a 50% stake in our Hornsea 3 project in the UK,” Errboe said in a statement Wednesday. “I’m pleased with the strong support from our shareholders. I see this as a strong indication that our investors see significant potential in Ørsted and in the offshore wind industry. Our key focus is to continue delivering on our business plan, which will enable Ørsted to remain a global leader of offshore wind with a strong foothold in Europe.”
In the short-term, Revolution Wind remains on schedule to begin delivering power to Rhode Island and Connecticut in the second half of 2026. The 704 megawatts of nameplate capacity, 400 megawatts of which is under contract for purchase by Rhode Island, would provide enough electricity to power 350,000 homes across both states.
As of Sept. 30, 52 of the 65 turbines have been installed, along with the second offshore substation, according to Ørsted’s earnings report. Next steps include completing the onshore substation in North Kingstown’s Quonset port, which will connect the renewable electricity to the electric grid, and continued installation of remaining turbines and undersea cables.
The company’s financial outlook remains unchanged from the second quarter, expecting full-year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $3.7 billion to $4.2 billion dollars.
Ørsted shares rose 0.8% when U.S. markets opened Wednesday morning.

,California,2025-11-05 15:18:28+00:00,CalMatters,Prop. 50 passage sets off a chain of political and legal maneuvers,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/11/prop-50-political-maneuvers/,Potential challenges in the courts and in Washington may affect whether Prop 50 influences the 2026 political races.,"When California voters overwhelmingly passed Proposition 50 on Tuesday, they set in motion political and possibly legal maneuvers that will ultimately determine whether its overt purpose, increasing Democratic congressional members by five or more seats, becomes reality.
The first is a political scramble among politicians in both parties to determine who will run where in next year’s congressional elections.
Ambitious Democrats are lining up to run in the newly gerrymandered districts, some of which have been tailored to favor particular candidates.
The most obvious example is a district that stretches from the heavily Republican northeastern corner of the state to the northern suburbs of San Francisco, seemingly made to order for Mike McGuire, the outgoing president pro tem of the state Senate. In creating that district, Gov. Gavin Newsom and the Legislature aim to unseat Republican Doug LaMalfa, who now represents northeastern California in Congress.
The plan would, if successful, shrink Republican districts from nine to four, meaning that in some areas, such as in inland Southern California, current GOP incumbents would be compelled to either retire or joust among themselves for survival.
Prop. 50’s political impacts hinge on the assumption that maps ratified by the ballot measure actually are in effect for next year’s elections. While it’s likely they will be used, there’s a possibility that courts will intervene.
By happenstance, Prop. 50’s pro-Democrat gerrymander and the recent pro-Republican gerrymander in Texas are occurring just as the U.S. Supreme Court weighs a major case involving the federal Voting Rights Act. Its outcome could impact both.
The Voting Rights Act, passed by Congress in 1965 to bolster the civil rights of minorities, particularly Black people in Southern states, prohibits any voting procedure “which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.”
While the law bars exclusionary voting laws, it has been widely interpreted to require creation of districts specifically to increase chances for racial groups to elect representatives from their communities.
California’s independent redistricting commission, in plans drawn after the 2010 and 2020 censuses, adopted that interpretation, and the newly gerrymandered districts do as well.
However, the interpretation is being challenged before the Supreme Court in a case out of Louisiana, and its conservative members, a majority, have indicated both during arguments and in past rulings that they may consider it to be racial discrimination against white voters.
“This court held that race-based affirmative action in higher education must come to an end,” Solicitor Gen. D. John Sauer wrote in his brief in the Louisiana case. The same is true, he said, for using the Voting Rights Act to draw legislative districts that are likely to elect Black or Latino candidates.
President Donald Trump’s Justice Department monitored Tuesday’s voting and could contend that California’s new congressional maps are discriminatory and should be suspended until the Supreme Court renders its decision.
Trump seemed to hint about intervention in a Truth Social post Tuesday denouncing Prop. 50 as a “GIANT SCAM” and said that mailed ballots, by far the most prominent form of voting, disenfranchise Republicans and are “under very serious legal and criminal review.” He closed with “STAY TUNED!”
In 2001, the threat of intervention by Republican President George W. Bush’s administration thwarted plans by California’s Legislature for a gerrymander favoring Democrats, forcing them to make a deal with Republicans on maps that maintained the partisan status quo.
Even a brief interruption could undermine what Newsom and the Legislature seek in Prop. 50 because candidate filing for congressional districts opens on Dec. 19, and if the new maps are in legal limbo, current districts would be used for the 2026 elections.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110425_CASpecialElection_JK_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-05 10:57:50.652806
,Mississippi Today,2025-11-05 15:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Losing that is terrible.’ Federal budget cuts lead to the shut down of a UMMC opioid addiction treatment project,Allen Siegler,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/05/losing-that-is-terrible-federal-budget-cuts-lead-to-the-shut-down-of-a-ummc-opioid-addiction-treatment-project/,The Mississippi Horizons Project used telehealth to treat patients with gold-standard medicine for opioid addiction like buprenorphine.,"Mississippians struggling with addiction have one less option for treatment after Congress cut funding for a University of Mississippi Medical Center project shuttered this summer, according to a spokesperson for the medical center. 
The Mississippi Horizons Project used telehealth to treat patients with gold-standard medicine for opioid addiction like buprenorphine, according to a website that UMMC has since taken down. Started in 2022 when Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith sent $6 million of congressionally directed spending to the medical center, the program focused on connecting uninsured Mississippians to the medications. 
The program also offered addiction psychotherapy, financial assistance for prescriptions and in-patient treatment, medical transportation and peer support services, according to an appointment request form linked to the project website. 
“That’s where we should be headed,” said Greg Spore, a member of the Mississippi Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council and a lawyer with the Office of State Public Defender. “That’s our aim. Those are interventions that are working and will continue to work.”
Spore struggled with addiction for years before entering long-term recovery. He credits medication assisted treatment as an important reason he’s stayed sober. But for many Mississippians, treatments like buprenorphine are out of reach. 
“There’s no reason why we shouldn’t be flushed with such treatment across the state,” he said. 
The Horizons program ended quietly in July, with no known public announcement from the medical center. After researchers with Mississippi Horizons published a study in September about their work, Mississippi Today reached out to UMMC to speak with someone from the program about their approach to ending an overdose crisis that has killed over 10,000 Mississippians since 2000.
Only then did a spokesperson with the medical center say in an email that the program had shut down after losing federal funding. She did not answer whether the cuts were a result of the July congressional spending bill, how much longer the grant was expected to provide funds, what role Mississippi Horizons played in addressing the crisis or whether other UMMC substance use disorder efforts were impacted by the cuts. 
A federal government website that monitors how its grants are spent indicates that UMMC did not spend roughly $2.3 million of the $6 million Congress initially awarded the medical center. 
Mississippi Today emailed officials with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the federal agency managing the Mississippi Horizons grant, to ask why the funding was canceled and what other strategies the agency would use to address the addiction crisis after this cut. The newsroom received an automatic email response that said some operations were paused because of the government shutdown. 
Top officials with the Trump administration and the Department of Health and Human Services spoke of the importance of financially empowering states to prevent more deadly overdoses in a September press release announcing continued funding for state addiction efforts. SAMHSA spokespeople did not respond to an emailed question about whether this grant aligned with this stated mission. 
A spokesperson for Hyde-Smith did not respond to an email asking for the senator from Brookhaven’s thoughts on the cut. A federal appropriations website shows she requested over $4.5 million for UMMC for substance use disorder prevention work for fiscal year 2026, but neither body of Congress has passed that funding bill yet. 
Tricia Christensen, an independent overdose prevention and drug policy consultant, said telehealth services that pair people to medicine effective at treating opioid addiction are essential, especially in rural areas. In these regions, she said many drug deaths can be prevented with better access to resources that make up for limited transportation options. 
“From a bird’s eye view, it sounds like a huge loss,” she said. 
Mississippi Horizons’ September research paper highlights that in addition to its clinical work, the project also identified challenges that prevented Mississippians from being treated for addiction. The researchers found that because of misinterpretations of state and federal laws, biases against new patients and credit card payment problems, many Mississippi pharmacies were reluctant to work with UMMC to prescribe medications. 
Christensen said by identifying these particular problems, researchers and advocates can develop plans to overcome them. 
“Is it just an education issue that they don’t understand the law? In which case, we can maybe do some education with them,” she said. “Or is it more of a stigma-related issue, where more work needs to be done to change that narrative?” 
The Horizons shutdown is another instance of money intended to prevent Mississippi overdoses not being spent for that purpose. In September, a Mississippi Today investigation found that of the over $124 million the state had received in lawsuit settlement money from companies that contributed to a decades-long addiction crisis, less than $1 million had been used on strategies to address the epidemic. 
Some local officials have since directed opioid settlement money to prevent more drug deaths, and the Legislature is expected to start spending tens of millions of settlement dollars on new strategies this summer. The council Spore serves on advises state lawmakers on how they should spend those funds, and it recently released preliminary assessments of which projects the Legislature should invest in. 
UMMC applied for $10 million of state opioid settlement money to continue opioid addiction prevention, treatment and recovery work. The council ranked the project in the top tier of applications, although the subcommittee grading it recommended an award less than the medical center’s ask. 
After spending months examining how Mississippi could improve its response to the opioid public health catastrophe, Spore said he hoped the Legislature would use settlement dollars in part to create more programs like Horizons. Now, instead of expanding and supporting programs like it, he said he and others responsible for addressing the state’s overdose crisis will have to find ways to make up for its elimination.

For example, you might want to use a vacant lot for a new park in your community. But if we build a new park there, then we can’t build more housing. Which would you prioritize over the other? The same thing happens with our tax dollars. We only have so much money available, so do we spend it on healthcare or education? Or do we raise taxes to collect more revenue, even if it means individual households will have less money to spend?
New survey data from California voters reveals how people think about these tradeoffs, highlighting the kinds of tough decisions that policymakers and communities must navigate when trying to improve everyday life. 

Survey results point to three key areas of tension that can serve as a useful starting point for understanding the tradeoffs voters face when pursuing policy outcomes. 

State versus Local Control

Californians broadly agree on major goals like the need to build more affordable housing, expand access to good jobs, and ensure quality education. But questions remain regarding who should make decisions about how to pursue these outcomes. Should local communities retain control, even if that leads to delays or creates inequities across the state? Or should the state step in with top-down mandates, which might ensure faster progress but could override local community input? 
In our survey data, voters expressed strong support for state action in some areas. For instance, a majority (67%) want to equalize property tax distribution for school funding rather than rely on uneven local tax bases. At the same time, 58% favor local flexibility in school curriculum requirements, showcasing how support for state versus local control can vary even within a single issue area like education.

Fast versus Fair

How do we balance the need for speed and progress with a desire for equity and safety? California urgently needs more housing, but should we fast-track construction, or take time for deeper community engagement and careful environmental review? Should the state reduce licensure requirements for specific healthcare practitioners, in order to increase access to care? And what about increasing caregiver ratios for childcare and eldercare facilities in order to offer services to more people? 
On these questions, while many voters support expanding job responsibilities for certain healthcare workers to increase access, they draw the line at compromising safety. A large majority (79%) want to maintain licensing requirements for childcare and eldercare providers, even if relaxing those rules would create more capacity for children and elders who need services now. Similarly, 71% prefer keeping minimum staffing ratios for childcare and eldercare rather than increasing workers’ caseloads to serve more people.

Public versus Private Services

Who should provide essential services—private companies or the government? Many core services in California, from healthcare facilities to energy markets, are operated by private entities, with mixed results. Investor-owned utilities like PG&E have faced criticism for unaffordable rate increases that outpace inflation. Meanwhile, hospitals in rural areas are closing at accelerating rates because low Medi-Cal reimbursement rates and rising costs make them unprofitable.
Voters in our survey show clear preferences when it comes to public and private service provision on some issues. Two-thirds (67%) support raising taxes to develop government-owned energy infrastructure that could lower and stabilize costs, rather than relying on for-profit utilities with volatile pricing. Support for greater government involvement in healthcare is even stronger, with 76% of respondents supporting taxpayer funding to keep healthcare facilities open in underserved communities.
Even when voters support more government participation in providing essentials, though, they are not enthusiastic about sacrificing personal conveniences. This is clear in the case of transportation: 65% support expanding public transportation, but only 43% support charging drivers a fee during peak traffic hours to fund transit buildout. When the rubber meets the road, voters may be reluctant to accommodate certain approaches to achieving broader goals, especially if it means bearing the costs of change.  
Read the Report: Navigating Policy Tradeoffs
The data suggest that, while many voters might want to accelerate the supply of essentials like housing, they also want to balance this with a fair and equitable process for moving the state forward. These data are only the start, though, and a broad set of questions remain related to when and how voters are willing to make hard tradeoffs: 

How can communities and policymakers understand and articulate these trade-offs? 
How can Californians be better informed about what goes into these policy decisions? 
And how can both state and local  governments be more transparent in their decision-making?  

A survey like this cannot provide final answers, but it can help reveal the questions that deserve further attention.

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas officials proposed a change in funding for community corrections programs, cutting allocations to the state’s largest probation populations and increasing funding for others based on new metrics.
But low confidence in the changes and a lack of buy-in from local agencies prompted the state prison head to pause the plan. Community corrections programs are state-funded, county-controlled alternatives to prison and jail sentences, encompassing parole and probation and encouraging reintegration. 
Jeff Zmuda, secretary of the Kansas Department of Corrections, which oversees the state’s eight adult prisons, said the changes were necessary to address concerns about equity and transparency.
“There’s clearly, clearly not a clear understanding or confidence in the revised funding formula with some of our stakeholders,” Zmuda said.
He told the House Select Committee on Government Oversight on Monday that the new formula would be implemented over the course of three years, with full redistribution of funds in fiscal year 2029. Under the current plan, 10 of Kansas’ 31 judicial districts would see a decrease, and 21 districts would see funds increase.
It is unclear when and if the changes will proceed.
The greatest reductions were proposed for Sedgwick County, which would see a 37% reduction, a six-county district in the most southwestern corner of the state that would receive a 21% reduction and a district near central Kansas consisting of Ottawa and Saline counties that would see a 20% reduction. Wyandotte County, home to one of the state’s largest populations, would see a 15% decrease.
A six-county district in west-central Kansas would receive a nearly 60% increase in funding under the proposed formula, Sumner County would have a 57% increase and Leavenworth County would see a 55% increase.
Steven Stonehouse, the director of the Sedgwick County Department of Corrections, emphasized the importance of focusing on public safety in any funding reconfiguration. He also encouraged an independent evaluation of the corrections department’s proposed funding formula.
“It’s our position that we don’t know if these actually will improve, enhance or support public safety,” Stonehouse said.
Risk levels, crime levels, substance use and mental health issues remain the same in Sedgwick County, he said.
“This funding is the only thing that changes,” he said. “So that gives us pause and is quite concerning to us.”
He is also concerned that the proposed formula could allow for future changes based on “horse-trading” without consistency within the formula’s elements.
When a person convicted of a felony is put on parole, one of 17 state parole offices and a community corrections agency oversees case plans and reintegration efforts. Individuals are assessed and classified based on risk level, ranging from low to high risk, to determine the level of supervision. More than 5,130 people are under parole supervision in Kansas, according to corrections department data released Monday. More than 4,350 were men, and nearly 780 were women.
It costs the state $115.27 daily, or $42,000 annually, to hold one person in prison, according to 2025 numbers. To supervise someone through community corrections programs, the cost drops to $11.76 daily and $4,300 annually to supervise one person.
The new formula is based on a modified weighting of eight elements.
Zmuda, who has been secretary for six years, said 60% of a judicial district’s funding allocation is associated with caseloads, which uses point-in-time data from the first of the month, every three months. The remaining 40% is divided among poverty metrics, case filing numbers, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation’s crime index ratings, judicial districts’ population, a district’s square mileage, agency success and agency turnover rates.
He said the change was driven by community corrections agency directors, who said they didn’t fully understand how funds were being distributed and were concerned about funds being discriminately dispersed.
“I think that has caused some distrust because it’s been what it’s been for so long,” he said.
Zmuda speculated, based on his department’s annual report, that agencies could be classifying more individuals as “high risk” to receive more funding.
Rep. Kristey Williams, an Augusta Republican and chairwoman of the committee, encouraged Zmuda to examine his department’s performance measures to ensure they mirror its goals, begin auditing funding plans and communicate with counties that aren’t meeting performance expectations.
“It says in statute that the secretary shall audit the plans — the comprehensive plans — that are submitted,” Williams said. “I understand, and you’ve acknowledged, that this is not something that you do. Perhaps you do not have the bandwidth to carefully audit and make sure that they’re submitting budgets that are reviewed and dollars are accounted for, because we know that they are not.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Zmuda2-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-05 09:16:32.027963

And every morning, that list is dominated by debt collection cases, newly filed by credit card companies, debt collection firms or businesses seeking repayment. On Tuesday, of the 115 listed cases, 84 were for debt collections.
In the first nine months of 2022, the court system saw 1,869 debt collection cases filed. Every year since then, the number has risen. Through the first nine months of this year, there were 3,447, almost double the figure filed in 2022. 
“It’s pretty wild, the rise of them,” said attorney Stacey Stone, who practices in Alaska and is familiar with the issue.
Alaska isn’t alone in the upward trend — nationally, the number of collection lawsuits is rising after an ebb during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency.
January Advisors, a national data consulting firm that noted the rising trend in August, concluded that multiple factors may be driving it.
During the COVID-19 emergency, many Americans received financial aid that helped them pay down debt and build savings. Those programs have now ended, and American consumer debt is now at record highs, according to figures published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
The number of people who are behind on their credit card payments is also on the rise, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported earlier this year, and the number of car repossessions is rising.
Automated software programs also are making it easier for companies to more easily file large numbers of debt collection cases.
In June, the National Center on State Courts concluded that easier access to generative AI software is likely to increase filings in contract cases, like debt collections. 
Typically, a credit card company or medical provider will try first to get payment on an overdue bill directly. But if a bill still goes unpaid, many companies will deem the debt uncollectable. At that point, they sell the rights to the debt to a collections company.
The sale means the company with the unpaid bill will get at least some money, and then it becomes the collections company’s job to try to recoup the debt and earn money for itself.
Court filings in Alaska and elsewhere indicate that debt collection companies are filing more cases in an attempt to collect on the unpaid debts they’ve bought. 
Two researchers with Pew Research Center, in a September analysis, said that can have significant consequences for regular people.
People who are sued for consumer or medical debt rarely hire attorneys, they noted, and in many cases, people may not even be aware that they are being sued.
The Debt Collection Lab — a research group that includes Princeton University — found that in Oregon, private collection agencies filed the bulk of lawsuits on behalf of credit card companies, health care providers and utilities.
Only four percent of debt defendants responded to the cases filed against them, and as a result, Oregon courts awarded default judgments in favor of the debt collectors in almost seven of 10 debt cases filed between 2017 and 2023. 
Data on the result of Alaska cases was not immediately available, but a preliminary examination of court dockets and filing patterns by the Alaska Beacon shows that the trends in Alaska are similar to those in other states.
A frequent filer in Alaska courts, a national debt-buying company called LVNV Funding, increased its filings by 350% in a handful of states between 2019 and 2024, January Advisors found. 
In Connecticut, the top 10 most frequent filers in debt cases accounted for more than 80% of all debt cases filed in that state last year, January Advisors found, indicating that the most frequent filers are stepping up their aggressiveness.
“More people are defaulting on their debt right now because people are living paycheck to paycheck for various reasons, so I think you do have an organic process happening, but also there’s an aggressive process happening that’s uncharacteristic,” Stone said.
In Alaska, even a state representative has faced a debt-collection lawsuit whose details appear typical of the kinds of cases being filed here.
On Oct. 27, a debt collection firm known as Jefferson Capital Systems filed suit in Anchorage District Court against Rep. Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River.
According to the complaint, Allard took out a loan from Celtic Bank in 2023 and didn’t fully repay it. Celtic Bank subsequently transferred the debt — just $1,075 — to Jefferson Capital, which filed the lawsuit. 
The attorney who filed the lawsuit didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Allard didn’t know about the suit until she was contacted by the Alaska Beacon, which was already writing this article.
“Oh my God; I had no idea what this was about,” she said.
Stone is Allard’s attorney and said cases like these seem to come out of left field. She said they tend to be filed in bulk, and as a result, they may be inaccurate, especially when a case is filed by a third-party firm that has purchased debt from another source.
Allard has an attorney; most Alaskans named as defendants in a debt-collection case don’t have that, according to a review of online court records. 
Unlike in criminal cases, the state is not required to assign someone an attorney.
In most instances, that leaves the defendant to represent themselves or to seek help from a group like the Alaska Legal Services Corporation, a nonprofit that provides legal help to many Alaskans in civil lawsuits.
Maggie Humm, the corporation’s director, said it doesn’t have enough funding to take on every request for help that it receives, but it is seeing a surge in the number of requests for help on debt collection cases.
From 2022 through 2024, “there was a 61% increase in applications for all consumer protection matters,” which includes debt collections, said Humm.
Though the group hasn’t closed out this year, Humm said the number of people seeking help is about the same as last year.
If an Alaskan doesn’t respond to a debt collection lawsuit and a court issues a default judgment on behalf of a debt collection agency, a judge could order the garnishment of part of their income.
“Here in Alaska, we know that collectors file more cases because we have the Permanent Fund dividend … and they can garnish a percentage of it if they get a default judgment,” Humm said.
A court order also might allow a debt collector to go after someone’s checking account, other assets or — in the case of a member of the military — their military pay.
Humm said Alaskans who receive a legal complaint for debt collection should do their best to respond. She suggested they ask for help from the corporation, or get other help via online resources.
In September, the New York Times analyzed the surge of debt collection lawsuits and noted that part of the reason for the surge is that people don’t bother to defend themselves in court. 
A court defense may make someone less attractive as a target, the Times found, and if more people defended themselves, debt collectors might begin seeing lawsuits as an unprofitable way to do business.

California voters passed Proposition 50 on Tuesday, clearing the way for the state to redraw its congressional districts in a manner that could enable Democrats to regain the U.S. House of Representatives in next year’s midterm elections.
Though the U.S. Department of Justice sent election monitors to five California counties — prompting state and some local leaders to deploy their own election monitors — voting across the state went smoothly for the most part. Because of the atypical high voter interest in this year’s special election, some voting centers and college campuses reported long lines. By Election Day, over 7.2 million votes were already submitted.
The gerrymandering measure was a high-stakes gamble for Gov. Gavin Newsom, who initially floated the idea in the summer as a counter to Texas Republicans’ own mid-cycle redistricting efforts. Prop. 50 proponents poured more than $120 million into Newsom’s committee supporting the measure, while opponents raised $44 million. Groups unaffiliated with any Prop. 50 campaign spent at least an additional $26 million to influence voters.

Newsom, at a Tuesday evening press event: “We organized in an unprecedented way, in a 90-day sprint. … We stood firm in response to (President) Donald Trump’s recklessness. And tonight, after poking the bear, this bear roared with an unprecedented turnout, in a special election with an extraordinary result.”

In his victory speech, Newsom also urged Democratic leaders in other states to “meet this moment” and advance efforts to redistrict as well, including Virginia and Maryland.
With Prop. 50’s passage, five GOP congressmembers now face steep odds to re-election, write CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang and Maya C. Miller. U.S. Rep. Kevin Kiley’s 3rd District, for example, currently encompasses the Sacramento suburbs, but it will change to pull in Democratic voters from the city. The Rocklin Republican opposed Prop. 50, and pledged to run for re-election in the redrawn district.
Meanwhile, Trump has described Prop. 50 as unconstitutional and a “giant scam.” Despite unproven claims of widespread voter fraud, the president remains a vocal critic of mail-in voting, and vowed to give California’s mail-in ballot results a “very serious legal and criminal review.” The Justice Department plans to monitor election proceedings in California until Thursday.

A new California law that helps protect user data on the web may pave the way for nationwide protections, reports CalMatters’ Colin Lecher.
Gov. Newsom signed Assembly Bill 566 into law in October, which requires companies that make web browsers — such as Google’s Chrome or Microsoft’s Edge — to offer users by 2027 an opt-out “signal” that automatically tells websites not to share or sell their personal information while they browse the internet. 
The state’s consumer privacy watchdog, California Privacy Protection Agency, sponsored the first-in-the-nation law, which received pushback from Google — though the tech giant never publicly opposed the legislation.
Because it’s likely easier for companies to provide the service for all users in the country instead of just those in California, experts say the legislation has the potential to have more far-reaching effects.

Emory Roane, associate director of policy at Privacy Rights Clearinghouse: “It’s really not that difficult technically. … We expect it to have a national impact.”

Former VP Dick Cheney dies

Former Vice President Dick Cheney died at the age of 84 Monday, due to complications from pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, according to his family. After serving as a Wyoming congressmember and U.S. Secretary of Defense, he served as vice president under President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2009.
California Assembly Republicans paid tribute to Cheney, saying that his career in public service “reflected deep commitment to his country.” Democratic officials also expressed their condolences, including Newsom and California Secretary of State Shirley N. Weber, who in a statement said that Cheney’s “latter years were an example that we all need to speak up to threats against our democracy and our communities.” 
Cheney was a divisive figure who was widely regarded as the architect behind the U.S.’ wars with Iraq and Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The two conflicts and the country’s broader “war on terror” are estimated to have killed at least 4.5 million people.
After his tenure as vice president, Cheney became an outspoken critic of President Trump. During the 2024 presidential election, Cheney endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris, arguing at the time that Trump can “never be trusted with power again.” Trump did not release a public statement in regards to Cheney’s passing as of Tuesday evening, though the White House ordered flags to be lowered at half-staff in his honor.

Maura Healey’s “all-of-the-above” energy strategy as she seeks to thread an increasingly tighter needle to drive down costs, grow power supply, and meet climate commitments as offshore wind stalls.","MARK SANDEEN HAS big plans for Lexington.  
Sandeen, a member of the Boston suburb’s select board and president of the nonprofit group MassSolar, has been involved in solar energy projects for the new high school, parking lots, and town composting facility.  
But he may not be able to have it all. 
Towns and cities around the state like Lexington are now running into two caps that Massachusetts enacted over a decade ago on the amount of solar energy municipalities can net-meter from panels on rooftops, parks, and parking lots. Net-metering is a system in which customers with renewable energy like solar panels can receive a bill credit for the excess power they send to the power grid – making these projects, which often have steep upfront costs, more affordable over the long-term. 
Those caps mean Lexington will only move forward with the high school solar project that Sandeen estimates will save local taxpayers at least $73 million in energy costs over 30 years.  
The other potential projects, for now, won’t make the cut. 
“When municipalities start getting full because of the cap, it has a big impact on the solar developers who don’t have access to a large section of the market,” Sandeen said. “Lexington had to be the one to say to the developer, unfortunately, ‘We don’t have room. Our dance card is full.’” 
The issue threatens to undermine Gov. Maura Healey’s “all-of-the-above” energy strategy as she seeks to thread an increasingly tighter needle to drive down costs, grow power supply, and meet climate commitments as offshore wind stalls. The governor is pressing to cut red tape slowing down new solar generation in the face of declining installations in recent years. 
Now, solar officials and advocates are urging lawmakers to eliminate a 10-megawatt cap on the amount of energy municipalities can net-meter and a regional cap for how much solar power municipalities can net-meter with each utility provider. A draft amendment to Healey’s energy affordability legislation viewed by CommonWealth Beacon, whose sponsor shared the language on the condition of anonymity, would eliminate the 10 MW limit.  
“Remove the caps,” Haskell Werlin, business development director at the renewable energy development company Solar Design Associates, said at a Senate Committee on Climate Change and Global Warming hearing last month. “They’re an impediment to the growth of solar in the commonwealth.” 
The administration appears open to getting rid of the local cap, though the regional cap is trickier given its potential impacts on ratepayer costs, Department of Energy Resources Commissioner Elizabeth Mahony said at the hearing. Raising or removing either cap wasn’t included in Healey’s initial energy affordability legislative package filed earlier this year.  
“That’s a cap that really should be addressed,” Mahony said of the local limit. “I think there’s a lot of communities that have learned and figured out how to do this well, and are figuring out how to do it well on rooftops, and there’s a lot of municipal buildings. That’s something that is more easily addressed, and we have seen the direct benefits from municipal projects to municipal budgets.”

But eliminating the caps without first cutting the state’s large net-metering compensation rates could trigger even greater electric bills for ratepayers, warned Christopher Knittel, associate dean for climate and sustainability at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  
While solar customers should get paid for the excess energy they sell to the grid, the current net-metering structure is such that they are also off the hook for costs tied to transmission and distribution infrastructure even though they take advantage of the wires and poles that both send energy onto the grid and receive electricity when the sun isn’t shining, he said.  
“If I had my druthers, we would get rid of net-metering, and have a smart way to price electricity imports and exports, and then get rid of the cap, because once the town is being paid commiserate to their costs and the system costs that they’re alleviating because of their solar, then go at it. Build as much as you want,” Knittel said. “But what I worry about in the absence of a cap is a bunch of wealthy towns building a lot of solar and then transferring their transmission and distribution costs to the poorer towns that don’t have the means to build as much solar.”   
Either cap can restrict municipalities’ solar development depending on the individual circumstances.  
While Eversource and Unitil both still have availability under the regional cap for municipal solar, at least 25 municipalities from Worcester to Pittsfield to Fall River have fewer than 4 MW of available solar under their local cap for net-metering. 
National Grid, on the other hand, has had no capacity left for municipal solar net-metering for more than eight years, meaning no municipalities served by that utility can deploy additional net-metered solar even if that city or town has room left in their local cap. A spokesperson for the Department of Energy Resources said there has been decreased demand for new municipal net-metered projects in recent years following a period of earlier rapid growth. 
State officials had their reasons for implementing the caps in the first place, said Nathan Phelps, managing director at advocacy group Vote Solar and a former senior economist at the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities.  
At the time, when Massachusetts first instituted the caps in 2010 at the dawn of the adoption of the technology, the 10 MW limit for each municipality felt generous. And the rationale for granting each municipality regardless of size the same cap was to protect small towns: If an aggregate municipal solar cap was established, large cities like Boston could gobble up all the capacity, leaving small towns with few tools to deploy solar projects in their communities.  
The regional cap is meant to insulate ratepayers from runaway costs, Knittel said. Massachusetts has some of the highest net-metering incentives in the country, which ratepayers pay through their electric bills, and this cap aims to limit the financial burden placed on customers without rooftop solar. 
But now, the caps are “a relic of a historical moment when there was a lot more concern about the ability of the grid to modernize, to actually take on and manage these distributed energy resources,” said Meghan Shaw, who works on climate strategy and implementation for Cambridge. “The whole landscape around grid modernization has really changed.”  
Cities and towns around the state that do want to deploy more solar have another option. They could choose to register their solar projects through the state’s SMART solar incentive program, established in 2018, which operates similarly to the net-metering program in that projects can receive credits on their electric bill. The state just revised the program and opened up 900MW of solar capacity for this year. 
Of the municipal solar projects currently deployed in Massachusetts, SMART program projects that receive what’s known as “alternative on-bill credits” account for more than double the amount of power compared with those compensated through net-metering, according to state solar data reviewed by CommonWealth Beacon.  
But there are stipulations with the SMART program that have steered some municipalities away, forcing them to confront the net-metering caps that threaten to squeeze their projects.  
For one, the net-metering compensation rates are generally better than the credits offered under SMART.  
And under the SMART program, municipalities are forced to sell the Renewable Energy Certificates generated by the solar project to the utility, which supports meeting state climate goals but makes it harder to achieve local renewable energy targets. Utilities must purchase a certain number of these credits each year to meet the state’s green energy commitments. 
The latter is the reason why Cambridge is pushing for the state to lift the caps. The city has net-metered more than 7.3 MW of solar energy and wants to install more solar projects on schools and municipal buildings. 
“It doesn’t take very many projects for us to bump into that cap,” Shaw said. “Anytime there’s a roof replacement on a municipal building, or a new building being built, we’re always looking to maximize solar on those projects. We certainly don’t want to be in a position where we need to pick winners and losers, and solar is really key to meeting the city’s goals to be net-zero by 2050.” 
For Sandeen, the higher net-metering rates and the lack of certainty with the SMART program is what’s led to his legislative push to eliminate the caps. The state needs to add more capacity into the program every few years and adjust the incentives annually based on market conditions.  
New Bedford, with just 2 MW available for net-metering under its local limit, is also concerned about its cap restricting future solar development. The city wants to keep both the renewable energy credits that solar projects generate for its own clean energy goals and finds that the higher compensation rates available through the net-metering program is what helps make the projects economically viable.  
“Originally, the cap was established to protect the ratepayers, but now actually is kind of putting the brakes on municipalities to help deploy clean energy,” said Tyler Reis, the city’s energy manager. “We’ve been selective about what projects we are going to choose to go forward with as a result.” 
The Solar Energy Industries Association said in a statement that it is supportive of the push to eliminate the caps. And Adam Chapdelaine, executive director of the Massachusetts Municipal Association, told CommonWealth Beacon that the caps “certainly merit reconsideration by the Legislature.” 
What kind of opposition the push to lift the caps will face in the Legislature is still unclear. The utilities could in theory take issue with an effort to expand solar net-metering because it is costly for ratepayers and reduces the demand for large-scale electrical transmission. But Eversource, National Grid, and Unitil declined to comment on the legislative push. 
Even as momentum toward eliminating the caps is growing, more legislative fights around solar are ahead as Massachusetts tries to accelerate solar power quickly with the expiration of federal tax credits and a crackdown on offshore wind from the Trump administration. The solar industry is pushing back against Healey’s proposals in her energy affordability bill to cut the net-metering compensation rates for large solar projects in an effort to lower electric bills and force those projects to join the SMART program.  
“Here’s a legislative restriction that nobody can remember why it’s there,” Sandeen said of his push to eliminate the caps. “From a political perspective, I think this is a win-win for everybody.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NewtonSolarOverParkingLibrary-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-05 09:00:50.984772

California voters backed Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to redraw congressional districts in favor of Democrats. It was a big night for him in his rivalry with President Donald Trump.


California voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved Gov. Gavin Newsom’s measure that allowed the state to redraw its congressional map in favor of Democrats, pushing back against President Donald Trump’s effort to hold onto a Republican-controlled Congress by urging redistricting in Texas. 
Tuesday capped off a whirlwind, hyper-partisan two-and-a-half-month campaign for one of the most expensive ballot measures in state history. Supporters poured more than $120 million into Newsom’s committee supporting the measure. Opponents raised just $44 million. Outside groups spent $27 million to try to sway the vote. 
Here’s what you missed. 
Newsom declares victory
In a triumphant speech, Newsom proclaimed that Prop. 50’s victory was not just a win for California, but a win for the entire country. He called on leaders in other Democratic-held states — Illinois, Virginia, Maryland and New York — to “meet the moment” and redraw their congressional districts, too. 
“Instead of agonizing over the state of our nation, we organized in an unprecedented way,” Newsom said. “Tonight, I’m proud. But I’m very mindful and sober of the moment we are living in. Donald Trump does not believe in fair and free elections, period and full stop.”
Prop. 50’s passage marked a significant victory for the governor, who took a political risk on the measure, calculating that it would give the state’s Democratic voters who are frustrated with the Trump administration a way to “fight back.”

Though opponents criticized him for using the measure to burnish his national profile, Newsom was joined in his effort by numerous liberal groups, who argued that helping Democrats win the House could counter the administration’s aggressive immigration raids, cuts to social services and erosion of democratic norms. 
Republicans vowed they will still challenge Democrats statewide, and said the election distracted from issues like the cost of living. 
“Even under this new map, Republicans have clear opportunities to flip seats because Californians are fed up with Democrat chaos,” National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Richard Hudson said in a statement.
What this means for incumbent Republicans
Five GOP congressmembers now face steep odds to re-election and are more likely to lose their seats after next year’s midterms: 

Rocklin Rep. Kevin Kiley reaffirmed Tuesday night he’ll run for re-election despite his 3rd District becoming more liberal: “Politicians can change the lines on a map, but they can’t tell you how to vote.”
Chico Rep. Doug LaMalfa, whose 1st District in the vast rural northeast corner of California, will lose several conservative counties and take in liberal Santa Rosa, has also said he will run again.
Corona Rep. Ken Calvert will have to decide whether to run in a primary against a fellow Republican after his Riverside County district moves completely. He’ll instead be in the safe Republican 40th District held by Rep. Young Kim. 
Hanford Rep. David Valadao’s district in the southern Central Valley will become slightly more Democratic and stretch closer to Fresno. The race could still be competitive; the Republican has held onto his seat despite a Democratic registration advantage. 
Escondido Rep. Darrell Issa’s eastern San Diego County district will lose conservative pockets and gain liberal voters in the Coachella Valley. He said Tuesday night that he’s “not quitting.”

What this means for Democrats
Five Democratic House incumbents have seen their districts grow safer under Prop. 50:

Rep. Josh Harder, a Stockton Democrat, was swept into Congress during the 2018 Democratic wave and he has held onto his Stockton-based seat despite being a perpetual Republican target.
Rep. Adam Gray of Turlock had the closest 2024 House race in the country. With more Democratic voters from Stockton, it will be much easier for him to hold the seat next year.
Rep. George Whitesides of Santa Clarita represents northern Los Angeles suburbs in the 27th District that have grown gradually more liberal. His new seat brings in more Democratic voters from the San Fernando Valley.
Rep. Derek Tran of Cypress should have an easier time defending his seat in the heavily Asian 45th District, which straddles Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
Rep. Dave Min of Costa Mesa won his 47th District seat by fewer than three percentage points last November. The new map shifts his district away from Huntington Beach and Newport Beach.

While numerous Democrats have been running assuming the new maps would apply, several are poised to switch districts now:

Rep. Ami Bera in Sacramento County, will shift from the 6th District to challenge Kiley in the 3rd District.
In turn, Dr. Richard Pan, a prominent former state senator who had already declared a challenge against Kiley, said he will now run in the 6th District.
Two candidates challenging Calvert in his current district — Brandon Riker and Anuj Dixit — have said they will instead challenge Issa in the newly drawn 48th District. 

Trump threatens ‘legal and criminal’ review
Trump threatened Tuesday to challenge California’s mail-in ballot results, claiming without evidence that it was fraudulently conducted — even before any results were in.
The president said there would be “very serious legal and criminal review” of the state’s use of universal mail ballots. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt later said Trump was working on an executive order to strengthen elections and assure there isn’t “blatant fraud” in California’s universal mail-in ballots. 
About 7 million Californians had already voted by Election Day, 4.6 million of whom put their ballots in the mail. Another 2.3 million put a ballot they received in the mail at a ballot drop-off box or at an elections office. For more than a decade, the majority of voters in California elections have participated by mail. Voter fraud is extremely rare, and studies have found no evidence that voting by mail increases fraud.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110425_CASpecialElection_JK_CM_25.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-05 09:00:50.984772

Legislation recently enacted in California will make it easier for consumers nationwide to protect their data




The privacy changes web browsers will be required to make under a new California law could set the de facto standard for the entire country, changing how Americans control their data when using the internet, according to experts. 
Assembly Bill 566, recently signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom, requires companies that make web browsers to offer users an opt-out “signal” that automatically tells websites not to share or sell their personal information as they browse. 
“We expect it to have a national impact.”Emory Roane, Privacy Rights Clearinghouse
It will likely be easier for companies to roll out the service for the entire country, rather than for users only in California.  
“It’s such a trivial implementation,” said Emory Roane, associate director of policy at Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, an organization that pushed for the legislation. “It’s really not that difficult technically.”
The legislation, a first of its kind in the country, was sponsored by the California Privacy Protection Agency, the state’s consumer privacy watchdog, as well as several consumer advocacy and privacy rights groups. 
Under the law, browsers like Google’s Chrome and Microsoft’s Edge will have until the beginning of 2027 to create a way for consumers to select the signal. Combined with recent changes from other states, the new law could be a tipping point in how web traffic is treated in the United States.
“We expect it to have a national impact,” Roane said.
A national standard
California already offers privacy protections under the California Consumer Privacy Act, including a right to opt out from having their information sold. 
But advocates for the new law point out this still puts the burden on the consumer to navigate to web pages and individually select web pages to opt out from. The new tool will effectively automate that process, giving consumers a single toggle to keep their data protected. 
“I would argue if you have to go to every individual website and click the link saying you ‘don’t want your information sold or shared,’ that’s not really a meaningful privacy right,” said Caitriona Fitzgerald, deputy director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, another organization that pressed for AB 566.
Already, some browser makers have voluntarily offered similar settings under a framework called the Global Privacy Control. Mozilla’s Firefox, for example, includes a setting called “tell websites not to sell or share your data.” With that setting on, the browser communicates to sites that the visitor wants the site to respect the user’s preference.
Several states, including Texas and New Jersey, have moved to force companies to respect such preferences, and California’s attorney general has even taken legal action against businesses that fail to do so. 
But until now, browsers haven’t been required to offer a setting that uses the Global Privacy Control or another standard to communicate users’ preferences. “There are browser extensions but those aren’t very widely used,” said Nick Doty, senior technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology. 
Since it would likely be burdensome for companies to carve out a way to only allow the signal to be used by Californians, according to experts, the tool will likely be available across the country. How, exactly, that will look still remains to be seen. The legislation doesn’t require browser makers to use a specific standard. (Spokespeople for Google and Microsoft declined to comment on the companies’ plans.)
There’s still a risk that some websites may try to detect which state a visitor is from, and only respect the signal if they find the visitor is from a state that mandates it.
This is legally risky, though, according to Roane, who points out that AB 566 applies to residents of California, regardless of whether they’re using the web from California.
“If I’m safe saying I’m a resident and you’re assuming I’m not and you’re flagrantly not respecting my privacy wishes, that is a violation of the law,” Roane said. 
Pushback from Google and the industry
The law didn’t get across the finish line without friction. As CalMatters reported in September, despite not being publicly against the legislation, Google organized opposition to the bill through a group it backs financially. 
AB 566 also wasn’t the first attempt at such legislation. Newsom vetoed a similar, but slightly more expansive, version of the bill in 2024. 
But now that the door is open, some advocates say they are going to continue to push to further expand privacy preferences.
Roane notes that legislation could be drafted that requires connected smart devices to offer an opt-out preference, or for vehicles that gather data on drivers to respect opt-out preference requests. 
“We are  finally, finally starting to have real privacy rights,” Roane said, “but we’re far away from them being really easy to exercise across the country and across the border and even in states like California where we have these rights.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/042023_Escondido-Real-Estate_LJ_CM_28.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-05 09:00:50.984772

Guest Commentary written by

I know what it feels like to be treated like property.
I was brought to the United States from Sri Lanka when I was 19 with promises of a good job and a better life. Instead, I ended up trapped in a house in Los Angeles, forced to work around the clock — cooking, cleaning, caring for children, washing cars, gardening. I worked even when I was sick.
I wasn’t allowed to leave. I was told I couldn’t — because I had already been bought. 
Recently Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 1362, which takes important steps to regulate recruiters of foreign laborers and provides protections for agricultural workers and others like me. 
The bill makes these recruiters register with the state, which can revoke their registration if they break the law or violate workers’ rights. 
These protections are long overdue, proof that California is listening to the voices of workers and survivors of labor trafficking, that our stories are finally being heard.
Yet AB 1362, while a step in the right direction, isn’t enough. It covers many foreign workers but not all. 
I came to the U.S. on a domestic worker visa, but many others arrive under one of the 13 other categories of temporary visas. We all need these protections, because traffickers thrive in the shadows and they don’t care about visa types. 
They look for loopholes. Every gap in the law gives them room to operate. And they know where the laws fall short.
We need protection not just at the point of abuse — usually on the job — but also from the very beginning, starting with recruitment in our home countries.
Telling my story isn’t easy. Even now, more than 25 years later, it hurts. But I share it because people need to understand how trafficking happens, how it often begins with a lie.
Recruiters go to poor villages in countries where people are desperate for work. They offer the perfect dream: a good wage, free services, an easy process, just eight hours of work a day, your own room, your own bed. 
To someone with no job and no options, it sounds like a miracle. That’s what I believed.
But once you’re on the plane to America, everything changes. They take your passport. They isolate you. You’re told you owe them — for the plane ticket, for the job, for every imaginary cost. 
Then the wages stop. One month. Six months. A year. Or in my case — four years.
I was made to work nonstop. I wasn’t paid. I was alone. I didn’t speak English, and I had no way out. I was slapped and pinched regularly, most often when I asked questions or tried to assert myself. 
The person I was working for threatened my family. When my father died, I was told I couldn’t go home. I couldn’t even send money. I was a prisoner. 
This didn’t happen in a far-off country. It happened here, in California. And it’s still happening today.
I’m deeply grateful to the lawmakers, advocates, and everyone who fought for AB 1362. Progress matters, but the fight continues.
I hope the study that AB 1362 requires the state Department of Industrial Relations to do will finally clarify how California can ensure all workers are provided these critical protections.
It breaks my heart that we’re still fighting for the most basic protections. Survivors like me are still speaking out, still reliving our pain, because change is far too slow — and for someone out there right now, it’s a matter of life or death.
AB 1362 gives us hope. Now let’s build on that — and make sure no one is left behind.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/012423-HUman-Trafficking-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C701&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-05 09:00:50.984772

(Julia Goldberg/SourceNM)Voter turnout statewide in Tuesday’s local elections increased by approximately 22% from two years ago, according to unofficial results from the New Mexico Secretary of State’s Office, with just over 25% of the state’s nearly 1.4 million registered voters casting ballots in close to 1,000 various contests.
The 50 nonpartisan mayoral races across the state included a field of eight contenders in Santa Fe to succeed two-term Mayor Alan Webber, who did not seek reelection. Santa Fe has used ranked-choice voting since 2018, which requires candidates in races with more than two people to garner at least 50% of the vote through elimination rounds.
The Santa Fe County Clerk livestreamed that process shortly after 10 p.m. and declared City Councilor Michael Garcia, who has been a vocal critic of Webber’s administration, the next mayor of the capital city. The Santa Fe County Clerk’s office reported 31.7% voter turnout, slightly higher than 30.98% from the last local election.
The Village of Taos also elected a new mayor, Dan Barrone, according to unofficial results.

In Albuquerque, which has automatic runoffs for candidates who did not receive at least 50% of the vote, incumbent Mayor Tim Keller and former Bernalillo County Sheriff Darren White will face off Dec. 4. Unofficial results from the Secretary of State had them receiving 36% and 31% of the vote, respectively, among a field of seven contenders (one of whom had previously dropped out of the race). 
Keller addressed supporters shortly after 9 p.m. Tuesday evening at the Arrive Hotel in Downtown Albuquerque and said he was gearing up.
“We are ready for a runoff,” he said, before pointing at the television news cameras: “Darren White, we are coming for you.”
In the six-minute speech to an enthusiastic crowd, the mayor defended his record over two terms, including touting progress with police reform and homelessness. And he said his campaign’s relative success came despite “immense criticism,” some of which he acknowledged as warranted.
“I listen. I understand the challenges that we have. I get that,” he said. “I also know some criticism was not warranted. It was not even true. But we know this. We are ready for a runoff for the future of our city, and we defend our families; we defend our city; and we’re going to stand up for what we believe in, whether it’s inside our city, or whether it is against Washington, DC and their efforts to divide us.”
Voting underway throughout New Mexico

While the mayoral races were nonpartisan, unofficial voter turnout data shows 
All election results remain unofficial until county-level canvassing is completed and the State Board of Canvass meets on Nov. 25 to certify results and order any recounts. Unofficial results as of publication showed more than 30 possible recounts throughout the state.
Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, in a statement following the election, called the local elections a success.
New Mexico in 2019 began holding consolidated local elections every two years, which “combined numerous smaller, often low-turnout local elections (such as for school boards, municipal offices, water and hospital districts, and other local governing bodies) into one uniform election held in November of odd-numbered years,” a news release from her office noted.
“Since consolidating local elections into this streamlined process, New Mexico has continued to deliver accessible, secure, and efficient elections for voters and administrators alike,” Toulouse Oliver said in a statement. “ I’m deeply grateful to every voter who participated, to the poll workers who served their communities, and to the county clerks and election officials statewide whose dedication made this election another success for New Mexico’s democracy.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/feeding-ballot-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-05 09:00:50.984772

New Jersey
After voters gave a resounding victory to Democrat Mikie Sherrill in the New Jersey governor’s race Tuesday, Sherrill celebrated her win with hundreds of supporters, vowing to fight back against federal policies that have put New Jersey and other Democratic states in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump’s administration…
After pointing to the Trump administration’s moves to cut federal food assistance to 42 million Americans, halt federal subsidies for Obamacare, and cancel the Gateway tunnel project, Sherrill vowed to “fight for a different future in New Jersey”…
She worked throughout her campaign to nationalize the race and paint it as a choice between democracy and the MAGA movement, often reminding voters that Trump endorsed Ciattarelli. She echoed that Tuesday night, saying New Jersey residents “take oaths to the Constitution, not a king.”

Virginia
Democrats completed a clean statewide sweep in Virginia on Tuesday night, as former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger defeated Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears for governor, Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, topped conservative talk-show host John Reid in the lieutenant governor’s race, and former state delegate Jay Jones unseated incumbent Attorney General Jason Miyares in a contest clouded by controversy…
The Democratic victories delivered a sharp rebuke to Virginia’s Republican establishment, which had controlled the executive branch since Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s election in 2021. After years of narrow statewide races and shifting partisan tides, voters restored full Democratic control of all three statewide offices for the first time since 2017…
Earle-Sears, a conservative firebrand and the state’s first Black woman lieutenant governor, leaned into cultural themes and parental-rights rhetoric that helped define the GOP’s earlier resurgence. But her alliance with President Donald Trump and friction with members of her own party over abortion and voting rules blunted her crossover appeal.

New York
Zohran Mamdani made history last night, romping to a decisive victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo in New York City’s mayoral election. In January, he will become New York’s first Muslim mayor, first immigrant mayor in 50 years, and youngest mayor in a century…
Mamdani now faces tremendous pressure to deliver on his agenda. “When we enter City Hall in 58 days, expectations will be high,” he said in his victory speech. “We will meet them.”
To do it, he’ll need Governor Kathy Hochul and the leaders of the Democratic majorities in the legislature to get on board.
That’s because the governor and state lawmakers — not the mayor or the New York City Council — are the ones who decide whether to give the Mamdani administration the billions of dollars it’ll need to realize his signature proposals of free buses and universal child care.

California
The maps voters approved with Proposition 50 make it likely that five of California’s GOP-held congressional seats could be won by Democrats in next year’s midterm elections. They also bolster the re-election chances of three Democrats currently holding office in now-competitive districts.
The passage is a triumph for Gov. Gavin Newsom, an early proponent of the gerrymandering plan whose backing set off a whirlwind summer map-drawing effort and quick passage through the Democratic-dominated state Legislature.
The campaign played out as a rebuke to President Donald Trump, and Newsom reaffirmed that message in a short speech at the Sacramento headquarters of the California Democratic Party.
“We stood tall and we stood firm in response to Donald Trump’s recklessness. Tonight, after poking the bear, this bear roared, with unprecedented turnout in a special election with an extraordinary result,” Newsom said.

Georgia
Democrats Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson have delivered an upset in Georgia’s off-year special election Tuesday, defeating two Republican incumbents on the state’s Public Service Commission.
The double victory marks the first time the Democratic Party has won a statewide constitutional office in Georgia since 2006…
“Affordability is front and center in voters’ minds, and today they overwhelmingly said they’re tired of subsidizing corporate interests at the expense of their families,” Hubbard said…
The DNC also celebrated the victory as a rejection of the Republican agenda on costs.
“This victory is a direct response to [Republican]’s cost-raising agenda that is squeezing pocketbooks in Georgia and across the country,” said DNC Chair Ken Martin.

Pennsylvania
Three state Supreme Court justices were elected to second terms Tuesday, despite efforts by conservative groups to persuade voters to oust them…
Their retention to 10-year terms maintains the court’s 5-2 Democratic majority…
Groups associated with billionaire donor Jeffrey Yass launched a campaign late last summer to mobilize voters to “term-limit the Pa. Supreme Court” and to associate Donohue, Dougherty and Wecht with unpopular decisions…
Nydea Graves, lead democracy coordinator of One Pennsylvania, which promotes progressive, multiracial working class political power, said the vote was a rejection of Yass and the MAGA agenda.
“Voters understood that Pennsylvania needs a court that holds true to the constitution’s promise of equal treatment for all of us. From voting rights to education equity to healthcare to workers’ rights, Pennsylvanians expect the law to be applied fairly, not just in favor of a privileged few,” Graves said.

On Tuesday, Trump indicated on social media that he’ll ignore judicial orders to provide Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to some 80 million Americans, including about half a million Nevadans.  
“SNAP BENEFITS, which increased by Billions and Billions of Dollars (MANY FOLD!) during Crooked Joe Biden’s disastrous term in office (Due to the fact that they were haphazardly ‘handed’ to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need, which is the purpose of SNAP!), will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!” the president wrote on Truth Social.
“The President is not a king,” Rosen said. “The President has been ordered by a court. He needs to follow the law.”
The White House announced hours later that Americans will get partial benefits, despite Trump’s claim. 
Rosen dismissed concerns voiced by tourism officials nationwide that the shutdown is causing a decrease in travel as the holidays approach. 
Trump’s tariffs, she said, top the list of reasons tourism is on the decline, and cited “a lack of visitation from Canada” and “people afraid to come” because of immigration crackdowns.  
“And I can tell you that people are worried about the economy – the affordability,” she said. “Things aren’t affordable in people’s lives. That’s what happens when you have inflation. So people are hunkering down. So it’s the Trump policies that are causing tourism to go down, not the government shutdown.”
“There is more risk in the system,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday of the shutdown’s effect on air travel.  Duffy predicted if the shutdown lasts to Nov. 11, U.S. air travel “will see mass chaos,” such as delayed flights and cancellations, as well as the potential for closed air space “because we just cannot manage it, because we don’t have the air traffic controllers.”
Approximately 95,000 Nevadans benefit from lower insurance premiums via the Affordable Care Act tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of the year, resulting in a doubling of premiums, Rosen said. 
Enrollment in the ACA has more than doubled, from 11 million to more than 24 million people since the introduction of enhanced premium tax credits in 2021, as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, with the highest growth rates concentrated in the deep South. Nevada enrollment increased 43% over the same period.
Should the tax credits expire, some insured individuals will qualify for a smaller tax credit, while others will be ineligible. 
Trump has “refused to meet with us,” Rosen said. “I don’t see how you’re ever going to talk about this issue, which impacts every single American, without having a conversation. So let’s come to the table. Let’s see where we agree.”
Politico reported Tuesday that Rosen and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, who has voted with Republicans for a continuing resolution, met with a group of fellow Senate Democrats Monday night to discuss a path to ending the stalemate. 
“The developing Senate deal would likely include the promise of a Senate floor vote that would probably fail, paired with a possible framework for subsequent bipartisan negotiations,” the story said. 
Rosen’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the meeting. 
Trump’s nuclear ‘telgraphing’
Rosen Tuesday said she also wants to hear directly from Trump that he does not intend to resume underground nuclear weapons testing at the Nevada National Security Site, formerly the Nevada Test Site, where above and below-ground testing took place for decades until a moratorium in 1992.
Rosen was reiterating the thrust of a letter sent by her and the rest of the state’s Democratic congressional delegation Monday to Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Administor of the National Nuclear Security Administration Brandon Williams demanding the adminisration “retract your directive on the resumption of explosive nuclear testing” and “reaffirm the U.S. moratorium on explosive nuclear weapons testing.” 
Last week, Trump announced on social media that the “process will begin immediately” to resume testing of nuclear weapons, though he did not provide details. 
Wright clarified Sunday that Trump’s plans do not include explosive testing. Rosen, however, wants to hear it from Trump. 
“I don’t believe any of our cabinet secretaries actually speak for the President,” she said, adding cabinet members are “trying to equivocate for the president, trying to get in his mind and fix the mistakes he made.” 
But rather than making a mistake, Trump, Rosen said, is “telegraphing what he wants to do. And Project 2025, which has clearly been a blueprint, calls for nuclear testing.” 
The right-wing manifesto also calls for reviving plans to bury high-level nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, just 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas. 
Rosen said she has not spoken with Gov. Joe Lombardo, who told the Current in 2024 that he does not support renewed nuclear testing in Nevada. Lombardo did not respond to requests for comment on whether he has contacted Trump regarding his plans.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RosenvideoACApremiums-1024x573.jpg,,,2025-11-05 08:18:32.079023

For that to happen, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s special session proclamation would need to include language allowing  the Legislature to take such action.
The Senate Democrats’ proposal would provide $45.5 million in immediate cash assistance to enrollees of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the federally funded program better known as SNAP or food stamps. An additional $91 million would be approved for December benefits and distributed only if federal funding for SNAP remains lapsed.
The cost of SNAP benefits in Nevada is about $90 million a month.
The Nevada Emergency Nutrition Assistance program, or NENA, is modeled after existing emergency benefit programs in other states, according to a memo released by the caucus. Such programs have allowed Virginia and Louisiana to react more swiftly as SNAP benefits have lapsed for 42 million people across the country.
NENA would not directly fund SNAP but would use the same outside vendor and existing electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards to provide cash assistance to SNAP enrollees. Direct funding is not an option, the federal government has told states.
Nevada’s SNAP administrator told lawmakers last week that he’d confirmed with the state’s vendor that a cash assistance program could be up and sending benefits out in just a week.
The status of SNAP benefits remains uncertain, with the USDA and President Donald Trump saying conflicting things about paying out partial SNAP benefits. Those statements came in response to two separate judges ordering the administration to pay out benefits.
Nevada, through Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford, was among the states to sue the administration over SNAP.
Democratic Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, who is running for Ford’s job, issued a statement praising Ford for taking action, but noted that “even if the Trump administration does ultimately comply with the court’s order, contingency funds would only cover partial benefits payments for November.”
She continued, “We may still face a situation where the ongoing federal shutdown causes benefits to lapse again at the end of this month.”
Lombardo, as well as two of his top staffers, last week said that SNAP will be a part of the special session agenda in some capacity. The governor’s office plans to replenish the $30 million taken last week from the legislative Interim Finance Committee to fund local food banks, which are experiencing a surge in demand.
The governor has also previously indicated that he would take legislative action on SNAP if the federal shutdown lingers into mid-November.
Josh Meny, a spokesperson for  Lombardo’s office, said in a statement Tuesday the governor “remains committed to finding a solution to source SNAP beneficiaries, and other Nevadans impacted by the federal shutdown, to the extent allowable under state and federal law.”
Statewide, 1 in 6 people, or 15% of the total population, receive SNAP benefits. A majority of them are children or seniors.
Democratic state Sen. Dina Neal in a statement noted that her North Las Vegas district has one of the highest SNAP usage rates in the state. 
“We don’t play politics with our neighbors’ ability to eat,” she said. “Nevada has to step up and work towards a solution to this problem.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/nevada-leg-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-05 08:18:32.079023

(Courtesy of Bountiful Food Pantry)As about 87,000 Utah families relying on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program prepare to go without much of their November payments, food pantries in the state are already feeling a bump in users and confusion lingers amid legal battles and conflicting messaging from the White House.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture sent regional SNAP directors a letter Tuesday morning with guidance to make court-mandated partial SNAP payments this month, as the government shutdown went beyond a month.
November payments, according to the letter, will be calculated by reducing the maximum possible SNAP allotment amount to 50% for all households, and then deducting 30% of households’ net income.

That’s an “overly complicated” formula, said Gina Cornia, executive director of Utahns Against Hunger. In some cases, it may also leave some recipients with barely any funds while the shutdown is in place, she said. 
A table from the Department of Agriculture lists a range of maximum allotments, for people receiving from $149 for a one-person household, to $894 for an eight-people family. 
SNAP_November_2025_Benefit_Guidance_Reduction_Tables
 
A spokesperson at the Utah Department of Workforce Services, which administers the food assistance program in the state, confirmed the office had received federal guidance on issuing partial November SNAP benefits. The department is working through the process and will have more information about what this will mean for users this week.
A defiant Trump vows no SNAP payments until Democrats cave on shutdown

It is also unclear when the payments will be available. While Cornia knows the Department of Workforce Services would like to get them out as soon as possible, the process will likely take at least a week, she estimated. So, despite the court order, people scheduled to get SNAP funds loaded into their cards on Wednesday will still see a delay.
“It’s just disappointing all around that Congress is allowing this to be such a political football,” Cornia said, “and that we are allowing people to go hungry because Congress will not do their job.”
Democrats ask for special session
Advocates are still fighting in court to get the federal government to make full SNAP payments this month. However, two rulings so far have blocked the Trump administration from cutting the program and the White House committed to partially fund the program
Since the committed funding is still partial, the Utah Senate Democratic Caucus urged Gov. Spencer Cox, Senate President Stuart Adams and House Speaker Mike Schultz to call for a special session to use the state’s rainy day funds to support SNAP recipients.



Let us know what you think...


 


“The timing is imperative for the state to cover the remaining amount to ensure families receive uninterrupted support while efforts continue to resolve the shutdown,” the senators wrote.
Utah uses on average $33 million in federal funding a month to administer SNAP. While state leaders recently committed up to $4 million to support the Utah Food Bank during the government shutdown, there are still challenges to deliver food to those who need it the most, the Democratic senators said. 
The districts with the highest SNAP usage are represented by the caucus, in addition to rural areas, the letter says, places where food insecurity and transportation challenges are more severe. 
‘Hopeless’: Utahns say shutdown’s pause on food stamp funding carries a steep cost

“Food is not a privilege, it’s a basic human right,” Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, said in a statement. “Every family deserves the security of knowing they can feed their children. Utah has the means to step in and ensure no one goes hungry while we wait for federal action.”
In a statement in October, Senate President Stuart Adams said the state would not step in to cover the program’s cost in November. 
“The state is not equipped to fund federal programs for weeks or months in the absence of congressional action,” said Adams, R-Layton. “It is unacceptable for Congress to allow Utahns and Americans to bear the burden of inaction.” 
Pantries see increased need
This week the Bountiful Food Pantry has been “bananas busy,” Rebekah Anderson, executive director of the pantry said. On Monday, 75 families received food assistance from the site in a two-hour shift. That’s up from a regular weekday, in which the center provides resources to about 55 households.
With those larger numbers, the pantry had to change how it operates as well. 
Usually the pantry works like a mini grocery store, where people can shop for their own food. “Yesterday, though we were feeding so many people, we weren’t able to do that,” Anderson said. “We had to just have volunteers go in and pick out groceries on behalf of people who needed help. So it’s a lot. There’s a lot of people who need help right now.”
The Bountiful pantry is well stocked at the moment thanks to “extremely generous” donations from the community, churches and businesses, Anderson said. But, if the current service levels persist, food is going to start to dwindle in about two weeks.
Many other pantries have been seeing a surge in demand in the last weeks, Cornia said, a fact she thinks may be tied to SNAP recipients preparing to not receive their benefits this month. 
“It’s great that the community is responding. But for every meal that is provided by a pantry, SNAP provides nine,” Cornia said. “And so there is just no way that our charitable sector, as hard as they work and as generous as Utahns are, that they will be able to fill that gap.”

The HAFB, housed in a warehouse compound of five buildings in west Montgomery near the old Maxwell Air Force Base, serves as a hub for food pantries across the state, which are left to feed more than 726,000 Alabamians in addition to its regular patrons amid the suspension of federal food assistance. 
The food bank has a group of regular volunteers that come at least every Tuesday and Thursday. William Furr of Montgomery, who has been volunteering for eight years, said Tuesday that he can’t say no to volunteering.

“We’re still not filling the need … They are really not deadbeats, sitting around doing nothing. These people need help,” Furr said Tuesday. 
When Furr began volunteering, he said there was a group of 8-10 regular volunteers. But the COVID-19 pandemic meant the volunteer base had to be rebuilt. There were at least 40 volunteers packing boxes at HAFB’s warehouse in Montgomery on Tuesday.
“I think people just see the need. You can’t say ‘no.’ It’s like, how can people get hungry? And therefore, how can I help?” Furr said. “This is a perfect place to do that. I think I make a bigger impact here than anywhere else as well, because of the impact they make.”
The group of regular volunteers were packing 25 pound emergency boxes Tuesday morning. The boxes have food like Chef Boyardee ravioli, rice, green beans and other canned goods. 
In a room next door, a group of volunteers from Alabama Power packed 10 pound boxes full of canned tuna, rice and vegetables. These boxes are given to small families and individuals, according to Volunteer Coordinator Laney Crowder. 
Within three days of packing, the boxes will be distributed to food pantries across the state and given to families in need, Shirley said.
“During this SNAP crisis, we’ve had an influx of volunteers that have helped make these boxes,” he said. “The biggest contribution has been all the financial donations that have come in. It could be anywhere from somebody just donating online $10, to we’ve gotten $10,000 checks from individuals.”
One dollar can buy five to six pounds of food, said Varina Mead, chief development officer of HAFB.
Trey Kennedy of Wetumpka and Richard Dudley of Prattville have volunteered at HAFB at least once per year for the last six years as part of Alabama Power’s service projects.
“We have a really good time doing it. It’s good for our group, but it’s also good for them and good for the city,” Dudley said.
Kennedy said the need for food is greater now than he’s seen during his time volunteering at various organizations. 
“We enjoy helping, and this, like Richard said, brings the team together. We’re also helping out our external organization, which is the public,” Kennedy said. “Other organizations set up food drives and pack smaller boxes than when they’re here, and there are cars lined up 100 yards waiting to get a box.”

Alabama Democratic lawmakers called Monday for a special session to supplement funding for SNAP benefits. The call came one week after the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced benefits for SNAP were suspended for November. According to the Alabama Department of Human Resources, more than 726,000 Alabamians receive SNAP benefits, which is about 15% of the state population. Of that number, 330,000 (44%) are children, according to DHR.
A spokeswoman for Gov. Kay Ivey said Monday she does not intend to call a special session. Ivey on Tuesday said she was sending $2 million from state emergency funds to assist eight food banks around the state, including Heart of Alabama.
A federal court on Saturday ordered the Trump administration to resume payments to SNAP beneficiaries by Wednesday. The Trump administration told a federal court Monday that it would use a contingency fund — which it had previously refused to employ — to pay about half the benefits for the month, though an official said that could take months. However, Trump said in a social media post on Tuesday that he would not obey the court order until the government shutdown ended.  
Heart of Alabama distributed 33.4 million pounds of food last year to its 211 partner agencies across the state, according to its website. 
In a tour Monday morning, Mead said one building is used for a USDA program that helps feed the elderly, one is storage, one is currently under construction and where volunteers were packing boxes Tuesday. Building four is where HAFB loads its fleet of 14 tractor trailers that are sent out to food deserts and serve as mobile pantries, she said. Building five is an 8,000 square foot freezer that is used to keep perishable food fresh.
Mead said that there has been an increase in community engagement through food drives, but a monetary donation goes much further for HAFB. The food bank shops in bulk at wholesale warehouses like Costco and Sam’s Club, and through partnerships with local grocery stores like Walmart, Publix and Kroger.

“Out of $1, we can make five full meals. So that’s not something that they could go to the store and purchase and do themselves,” Mead said Monday.
Mead said in an interview Tuesday that while there is an increased need for donations now, the food bank is constantly distributing food across the state. HAFB does not track which patrons are SNAP recipients, she said, but 70% of the people HAFB serves are employed. The other 30% are children, students, the elderly and people with disabilities that cannot work.
“A lot of people are coming to us for the first time,” Mead said. “There’s a massive misconception of what a SNAP recipient looks like.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1158-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-05 08:18:32.079023

“I think we need to be measured in what we are doing to where we don’t shut down what is now a vital part of our operations in law enforcement,” said Rep. James Lomax, R-Huntsville, who chairs the Alabama Unmanned Aircraft System Study Commission, in an interview following the meeting.
Lomax said that the policies must allow law enforcement to continue to operate but also protect individual privacy and following federal rules and regulations.

“We got a bunch of experts here, but I think we are going to be looking for ways to air-gap this technology to make sure they are on closed networks and operate it in a standard way across the state,” Lomax said.
Joey Hamilton, a special agent with the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency who oversees its drone unit, said ALEA uses drones to help with investigations into crime scenes and traffic collisions.
ALEA also uses drones for storm damage assessments, pre-raid planning and hostage negotiation. A significant portion of the agency’s fleet consists of drones made by Da-Jiang Innovations, a company based in Shenzhen, China.
Companies in China have cornered about 92% of the state and local first-responder market, according to the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International, a trade association for the industry.
Hamilton said competitors have not caught up with the quality of those drones.
“We tested a bunch of them, and I am sorry, they fall short,” Hamilton said. “I would like nothing more than to have a 100% American-made drone unit. But when it comes to something that costs 10 times what we use now, that will not do the job in any shape, form or fashion, it is such a huge difference.”
Several on the committee expressed concerns with security and expressed concerns that the foreign country could infiltrate ALEA’s systems through its operating system.
Hamilton said he is not concerned that the agency is using drones made in another country.
“We have taken every precaution,” he said. “You have to do firmware updates with DJI, but ALEA’s network is so heavily firewalled, I don’t think there is anything crazy that would come through there without our system catching it first.”
In the past couple of years, legislators have filed bills to restrict the purchase of drones made by foreign companies, especially from China.

But as bad as deregulation has been for the climate and for ratepayers, writes Brittany Baker, re-regulation, as Maryland’s major utilities envision it, could be far worse.","The Chalk Point power plant in southern Prince George’s County. (Photo courtesy of the Integration and Application Network, University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science)For the past quarter-century, Marylanders have been struggling with the impact of policymakers’ decision to deregulate the state’s gas and electric utility markets.
By many accounts, deregulation has been bad for consumers, attracting predatory energy suppliers to our state. And it hasn’t delivered on the clean energy expansion that backers promised when the Maryland General Assembly was racing to join other states in deregulating their utility markets back in 1999.
Recently, the new CEO of Baltimore Gas and Electric, Tamla Olivier, proposed re-regulating Maryland’s utility markets. That’s likely to be a major topic of discussion – and, quite possibly, significant legislation – in next year’s General Assembly session.
But as bad as deregulation has been for the climate and for ratepayers, re-regulation, as Maryland’s major utilities envision it, could be far worse. And it would likely do little to boost battery storage, solar energy or land-based wind energy – solutions that will both lower energy costs and help the state confront climate change.
There’s no doubt that Maryland is facing an energy crisis, but that’s not unique to our state. It’s exacerbated by the ever-growing demand for energy due to artificial intelligence and the proliferation of data centers in the region that serve the tech industry.
PJM, the regional grid operator, hasn’t helped by slow-walking approval of many projects, especially clean energy generation. At the same time, utility companies have been driving up distribution rates without increasing reliability or resilience.

With this as a backdrop, Olivier at BGE suggests that re-regulating the state’s utility markets would enable gas and electric companies like hers to begin to tackle the energy shortage by generating their own power in Maryland – something that current deregulation law prevents.
It’s easy to see that the profit motive drives the monopoly utilities that distribute energy in our state. They are accountable to their investors, not to the rest of us. BGE, the largest utility in Maryland, epitomizes investor-owned utilities that take advantage of ratepayers and squeeze them for every penny. BGE and other companies have been accused by a Maryland consumer protection agency of overcharging ratepayers for distribution for decades.
Now they are proposing to generate power in Maryland, once again, to rate-base these new facilities and further increase investor profits.
It’s painfully obvious that BGE wants to continue producing and distributing fossil fuels well into the future, despite the devastating consequences for our environment. BGE’s record, and those of other utilities, have already been less than admirable as Maryland inches toward an energy transition. During recent legislative debates, utilities sought to kill or weaken building efficiency standards and green building regulations.
We should be mindful that BGE’s name includes the word “gas” – an enduring part of the company’s legacy and business model. Who, if BGE and other utilities are allowed to generate their own energy in Maryland, will protect our environment and our ratepayers? Why would state officials want to continue enabling fossil fuel production when they claim they see the urgency of reducing carbon emissions and promoting renewable energy?
Next door in Virginia, lawmakers adopted utility deregulation a couple of years after Maryland did. But the state’s largest utility, Dominion Power, sought and won permission to continue generating energy in the state. That resulted in the construction of the next-to-last coal plant built in the U.S., in Southwest Virginia, which opened in 2012 and is set to keep operating until 2045. Marylanders surely don’t want something similar happening here.
During the 2024 General Assembly session, lawmakers put new rules in place to crack down on utilities’ unfriendly practices for consumers. Last year, they passed a law that added some additional, necessary guardrails on the state’s deregulated energy system. We need to let these reforms take hold before we even begin to contemplate another scheme that gives more power to investor-owned utilities, such as allowing them to build, own, and rate-base new energy facilities – a proposal that has the potential to do so much damage to our climate, communities, and pocketbooks.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/iil-bw-xx-cb-ian-aj-0013_0-1-1024x632.jpg,,,2025-11-05 07:56:42.349526

Last year, Atlantic County prosecutors charged Small and his wife, Atlantic City Schools Superintendent La’Quetta Small, alleging the two physically and emotionally abused their then-16-year-old daughter.
Prosecutors alleged Marty Small repeatedly punched his daughter in the legs and beat her with a broom so severely that she fell unconscious. They accused La’Quetta Small of repeatedly beating her daughter, dragging her by her hair, and striking her with a belt.
Both Smalls have pleaded not guilty. Jury selection for the mayor’s trial is due to begin on Dec. 1.
Small became mayor when his predecessor, Frank Gilliam, resigned the position after pleading guilty to wire fraud. Prosecutors had accused Gilliam of stealing $86,790 from a youth basketball league he ran.

The bills, introduced by State Reps. John Roth (R-Interlochen), Alicia St. Germaine (R-Harrison Township) and Samantha Steckloff (D-Farmington Hills), seek to address the problem of fertility fraud, where donors in reproductive treatment are not accurately identified or their backgrounds are misrepresented. 
Two women, both of whom discovered later in life that their families had been victims of this fraud, testified to the committee about the emotional pain and confusion that they had experienced learning about this kind of fraud. 
“I tell my story over and over again in hopes that it couldn’t, wouldn’t happen to other families or other people to have something so deceptive happen to them,” said Jaime Hall, a Traverse City resident who learned that her biological father was, unbeknownst to her parents, the doctor who had helped her parents with fertility treatment.

Lynne Weiner Spencer, who found out as an adult that she has at least 82 half-siblings from her sperm donor and that her parents had been lied to about the donor’s educational background, described that knowledge as “overwhelming.” 
“The fertility industry has been operating behind doors with very limited oversight,” she added. 
“Fertility is a multi-billion (dollar) industry. It’s actually projected to reach $40 billion next year, but in the United States, the only federal legislation that we have is the requirement to test donors for communicable diseases,” said Kara Rubinstein Deyerin, the founder of Right to Know, an organization advocating for children to know their genetic background. “There’s no accountability at all here. This is one of the most intimate decisions people make, and they’re relying entirely on the information provided to them by the clinics and the donors, information that they cannot independently verify.”
“They’re also often emotionally vulnerable and desperate to start a family, and we have to protect these parents and future children from exploitation, and I hope Michigan can do that,” Deyerin continued. 
Roth, who authored three of the five bills in the package, noted that the intention behind the bills is not to limit access to this kind of assisted reproductive care. 
“What we’re doing here isn’t a knock on IVF,” he said. “It’s to make sure when a woman or family goes to a clinic to get those services, that they get the service they ask for, and make sure there’s no fraudulent activity in that process.”
However, Stephanie Jones, the founder of the Michigan Fertility Alliance, pushed back on this as the only speaker to testify against the bill package in the hearing. Because it will increase potential legal risks for doctors — making them liable for any false or misleading information about a donor — fewer doctors will be willing to provide this kind of health care, she argued. 
“These bills would criminalize good physicians for things far beyond their control, including any inaccurate or incomplete information provided by a donor,” Jones said, calling the requirements for information that donors must report and doctors must provide “an impossible standard.”
“It’s a wolf in sheep’s clothes, and it risks dismantling modern fertility care in Michigan under the guise of protection,” she said, adding that the bill is broader than similar legislation in other states. 
Jones and Rep. Kathy Schmaltz, the chair of the committee and a co-sponsor of all five bills, briefly went back and forth about how prevalent this problem continues to be. 
Jones characterized the issue as “legislating on a relic of the past,” to which Schmaltz responded that the issue at hand is still happening. 
A previous iteration of the legislation was introduced last session, but stalled out during the lame duck session.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-05 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,It’s small businesses versus Trump in tariff case before US Supreme Court,Ashley Murray | States Newsroom,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/05/supreme-court-scotus-trump-tariffs-ieepa/,"The key question in the case, which SCOTUS will hear Wednesday, is whether Trump can authorize tariffs under Emergency Economic Powers Act.","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court will hear one of the first major cases of President Donald Trump’s second term Wednesday, when the administration defends the president’s emergency tariffs that American small business owners say are upending their livelihoods.
The question at the heart of the case is whether Trump can authorize sweeping tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA — the first time a president has used the statute to impose taxes on imports.
The suit, which challenges the bounds of Trump’s presidential power, is the first of the administration’s appeals to the high court to be fully argued on its merits. The justices have so far addressed Trump’s numerous appeals on other issues on what is known as the shadow docket, a fast track to make a decision without full arguments.
The president initially said he would attend the arguments in person but has since changed course and will go to a business forum in Miami Wednesday.
The high court convenes at 10 a.m. Eastern and live audio of the arguments is posted on the court’s website.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he plans to attend the arguments, “hopefully in the front row (to) have a ringside seat,” he told Fox News’ Jesse Watters Monday.
The tariff case is “one for the ages,” said Michael McConnell, professor and faculty director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School and member of the legal team representing the small businesses challenging Trump’s tariffs.
“The president has important powers that come directly from the Constitution, but he has no power to impose taxes on American citizens without the authorization of Congress, and tariffs are taxes on American importers,” said McConnell, who sat on the bench of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit from 2002 to 2009.
“IEEPA simply does not apply here,” he told reporters during an Oct. 28 virtual press conference. “It is a statute about imposing various forms of sanctions, economic sanctions, on countries with whom we are in conflict. It has nothing to do with imposing taxes on Americans for engaging in perfectly lawful trade with friendly nations.”
Tariffs a ‘terrible and unsustainable weight’
Victor Schwartz, founder and president of VOS Selections, a family-owned wine and spirits importer in business for four decades, said Trump’s tariff policy is an “existential threat.” 
Schwartz is the lead plaintiff in one of two consolidated cases brought by small business owners and Democratic state attorneys general to challenge the duties that can range from 10% to 50%, depending on the product’s origin.
“These tariffs threaten the very existence of small businesses like mine, making it difficult to survive, let alone grow,” Schwartz told reporters during the Oct. 28 virtual press call.
“Let me be clear, Americans are paying these tariffs, not foreign entities, and the tariffs are a terrible and unsustainable weight. We have to pay tariffs immediately at the port of entry, and we don’t see revenue from those products for at least five or six months,” Schwartz said.
Schwartz said he and his daughter, with whom he runs the business, can no longer import wines from South Africa, as tariffs on products from that country are set at 30%.
Other businesses that joined Schwartz on the lawsuit include a Utah-based plastics producer, a Virginia-based children’s electricity learning kit maker, a Pennsylvania-based fishing gear company and a Vermont-based women’s cycling apparel company.
Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon were among states, led by Democratic state attorneys general, that also sued.
The U.S. Court of International Trade and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sided with the plaintiffs in finding Trump’s IEEPA tariffs unconstitutional.
The justices will also hear from two Illinois-based toy companies who, in a separate case, challenged Trump’s emergency tariffs. Learning Resources Inc. and hand2mind manufacture most of their educational toys in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand and India. Imports from those countries are taxed anywhere from 15% to above 50%, and in the case of China have been unpredictable.
Trump says ‘country is wealthy again’ 
Trump told reporters Sunday aboard Air Force One that the case is “one of the most important decisions in the history of our country.”
In an interview with the CBS show “60 Minutes” that aired Sunday night, Trump said the economy “will go to hell” if the high court invalidates his emergency tariffs.
“Because of tariffs, our country is wealthy again,” the president told CBS correspondent Norah O’Donnell, arguing his use of tariffs as a negotiation tool will yield billions of dollars in investment in the United States from other countries. Many of the framework trade deals Trump has announced, including with the European Union, South Korea and Japan, are not yet finalized.
The government has so far collected $195 billion this year in customs duties at the end of September, according to a U.S. Treasury monthly statement.

In a September filing asking the Supreme Court to expedite the case, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wrote the U.S. would face “catastrophic” financial consequences, up to $1 trillion, if the emergency tariffs were overturned.
In the same filing, U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer argued the import taxes are Trump’s “most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative … which President Trump has determined are necessary to rectify America’s country-killing trade deficits and to stem the flood of fentanyl across our borders.” 
The administration is facing pushback on those arguments. 
Scott Lincicome, senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said a ruling against the tariffs “would not lead to financial ruin, as the administration has said.”
“The government also claims that ‘With tariffs, we are a rich nation. Without tariffs, we are a poor nation,’ — except studies of the fiscal trajectory of the United States with both the IEEPA tariffs, and without, show that we are drowning in debt either way,” Lincicome told reporters at the late October press briefing.
Cato filed a brief in the case arguing against the tariffs.
Some Republicans break ranks
The case has attracted nearly two dozen friend-of-the-court briefs urging the justices to deem Trump’s IEEPA tariffs illegal, including one signed by hundreds of Democrats in Congress and one Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. 
The lawmakers argued IEEPA “contains none of the hallmarks of legislation delegating tariff power to the executive, such as limitations tied to specific products or countries, caps on the amount of tariff increases, procedural safeguards, public input, collaboration with Congress, or time limitations.”
In the days leading up to the oral arguments, four Republican senators broke ranks to join Democrats in passing joint resolutions ending Trump’s emergency declarations triggering tariffs. 
One of the bills, passed Oct. 28, targeted Trump’s emergency declaration that led to 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, including that nation’s major export: coffee. The symbolic bills are not expected to be taken up in the GOP-led House, but mark a shift from when Senate Republicans blocked a similar measure in April.
In its Supreme Court filing, Cato argued the administration’s reading of IEEPA “not only stretches the text beyond recognition but also undermines the Framers’ designs for the separation of powers. Accepting the government’s theory would mean that Congress, through ambiguous text and silence, can transfer sweeping legislative power to the President — a result this Court has cautioned against.”
In an amicus brief supporting Trump’s trade strategy, the America First Policy Institute, a conservative think tank heavily involved in Trump’s second presidential campaign, defended the tariffs as a “pillar of the America-first policies of the current administration” and argued the president has unilateral power to impose the taxes under a Depression-era law.
Executive orders and more
Trump began imposing tariffs under IEEPA through a series of executive orders and proclamations in February and March on products from China, Canada and Mexico, declaring these countries responsible for illegal fentanyl smuggling into the U.S. 
The president escalated the emergency tariffs over the following months on goods from around the globe, declaring trade imbalances a national emergency. In addition to a baseline 10% global tariff, Trump specifically targeted countries that export more goods to the U.S. than they import from U.S. suppliers.
As recently as late August, Trump imposed an extra 25% tariff on goods imported from India, bringing the total tariffs on Indian products to 50%, because of the country’s usage of Russian oil. 
In early August, Trump slapped a 40% tax on all Brazilian goods after he disagreed with the country’s prosecution of its former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro for plotting a coup to remain in power in 2022.

(Getty Images)Indiana’s trial courts use largely individually set, unwritten methodologies to decide who’s poor enough for publicly funded legal defense, the state has found.
About two-thirds of Hoosier judicial officers — judges, magistrates, commissioners and referees — reported policies at their trial courts are set by individual officers, and a similar proportion noted they don’t have written policies.
That’s according to a survey sent to 514 judicial officers working for trial courts in mid-January. More than 340 replied by the mid-February deadline, and of those, 261 presided over criminal cases and were shown the full list of questions.
Derrick Mason (Courtesy Commission on Court Appointed Attorneys)
The study arose from 2024’s Senate Enrolled Act 179. The little-known Justice Reinvestment Advisory Council approved its release ahead of a July deadline — to little public fanfare.
“In a system of limited resources, we all want to guarantee that funds are available to effectively protect the constitutional liberty rights of Hoosiers,” Mason said. “Having fair and consistent indigency determinations helps make the criminal justice system more efficient and effective.”
The U.S. and Indiana constitutions guarantee the right to counsel for people accused of crimes. Courts assess whether defendants are indigent — unable to afford private attorneys without substantial hardship — before appointing them public defenders.
Mason’s is the only state agency that publishes standards and guidelines for indigency determinations. They’re applicable only to counties that choose to comply in exchange for partial reimbursement of felony criminal public defense expenses.
Sixty-six member counties or coalitions logged about $58 million in public defense expenses for non-capital cases in the first half of 2025, according to the commission. That doesn’t include spending in non-member counties. More than $150,000 in reimbursement requests for capital cases, for which all counties are eligible, were filed over that time period.
The findings
Of the 261 trial court judicial officers who presided over criminal cases, 75% were judges, 23% were magistrates and 2% were either commissioners or referees.
Percentages for answers were based on the number of respondents to each question, not to the survey as a whole.
About 65% reported that the policy for making indigency determinations is set by individual judicial officers — with 27% reporting court-level policies and just 8% noting county-level policies.
The non-judge respondents were asked if they follow the same policies as their supervising judges. Three-quarters said they do and a quarter said they don’t.
The survey found that a high percentage of initial hearings were held for criminal felony cases, but that they were waived more often in criminal misdemeanor cases. A majority of cases where an indigency determination was made at the initial hearing resulted in the appointment of a public defender.

Indigency assessments were also conducted at “status of counsel” hearings, after private attorneys withdrew and throughout the proceedings.
About 68% said there were no written procedures for making those indigency determinations, while 32% reported having written policies.
Almost three-quarters of respondents said they use a standard “dialogue” for indigency determinations during hearings, with about two-thirds of them being self-created. Others were provided by current or prior judges, or came from bench books. Just 1% said their counties had developed the dialogues.
A defendant’s income, employment status, expenses, assets and housing status were among the most commonly asked-about factors. Several respondents said employment status, or the ability to pay bail, was enough on its own to determine someone doesn’t qualify for a public defender.
When a defendant provides a court with information that no attorney will take the case as private counsel, or requests appointed counsel, the vast majority of respondents said their courts don’t verify the information beyond taking answers under oath or penalty of perjury, or setting additional “status of counsel” hearings.
Indiana’s attorney shortage was a least a minor contributor in decisions to appoint public defenders for 22% of respondents.
Just over a quarter reported having a process to identify the cost of counsel in their communities, and only 4% said their court has compiled information on local attorneys’ rates.
For help finding affordable attorneys, defendants are often referred to local bar associations, online listings, references at the courthouse and so on, according to the survey.
The report also includes results from city and town courts, which have more limited jurisdictions. The survey was sent to 45 judges, but of the 22 who filled it out, just 14 indicated they preside over criminal cases.
Recommendations made
The report called on the state, and local bar associations, for changes to boost consistency across Indiana.
In the short-term, it recommended that the Office of Judicial Administration continue training judicial officers on their constitutional obligations, current statutes and case law, substantial hardship standards and more.
9 Indiana counties chosen for misdemeanor defense reimbursement pilot

That training should emphasize that single factors alone aren’t enough to determine indigency unless that’s in law, the report continued. For example, Indiana Code allows a court to consider eligibility for public assistance programs as sufficient evidence someone qualifies for a public defender.
Another short-term suggestion was that bar associations develop directories of area attorneys and make available them available online or at courthouses — and maintain reports on the range of private attorney costs for criminal cases that courts can use.
Substantive changes shouldn’t be made until a commission pilot program concludes, the report added.
Nine counties will be eligible for 18 months of partial reimbursement of misdemeanor public defense expenses, as part of an initiative authorized last year, under the same law that launched the survey.
The statute lets the commission pick up to 12 participants for a four-year pilot ending in 2029, but the agency cut back on both in response to budget reductions.
“The Commission’s standards and guidelines on indigency determinations largely echo caselaw and allow for determinations to reflect local income levels and legal costs,” Mason said. “We would be happy to assist the courts as they implement JRAC’s recommendations.”

(Getty Images)Indiana entrepreneurs need low-cost, reliable power.
Gov. Mike Braun has pledged to be the entrepreneurial governor, but that vision will require reliable, affordable electricity to come to fruition, and the infrastructure to carry it.
That means building more power plants and the transmission lines needed to transport the electrons to economic demand centers. But while Indiana and other Midwestern stakeholders have engaged in a years-long evaluation of infrastructure solutions to meet the region’s needs, culminating in a transmission portfolio that will deliver historic benefits, out-of-state interests are now seeking to block the very development needed to enable entrepreneurial growth.
The Midwestern grid operator (MISO) is a national leader in transmission planning and has developed a plan to meet the region’s needs. After 300 meetings and 40,000 hours of staff time in development, MISO approved a portfolio of power lines in late 2024 that will help ensure reliable, affordable power for decades to come. That decision followed rounds of feedback and expansive stakeholder outreach among the states in the region, including Indiana.
All told, the portfolio is expected to deliver $72 billion in net benefits over the power lines’ first two decades in service, saving residents up to $3 for every dollar invested. In Indiana, the projects are expected to create upwards of 7,100 direct local jobs and spur up to $2.6 billion in total economic output.
Opposition states
Yet the public service commissions in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, and Montana filed a federal complaint seeking to derail the portfolio, arguing MISO used a flawed cost-benefit analysis. The filing comes nearly eight months after the grid operator approved the portfolio and nearly two years after planning was underway with the methodology in question. Notably, the southern states will not pay for the projects, as their costs will be distributed only among the states where they are constructed.
This complaint serves only as an attempted roadblock to halt the projects Indiana needs. Our governor has warned that the state does not have enough power to meet growing demand. And power bills are skyrocketing. From 2024 to 2025, Indiana families saw a 17.5% increase on their monthly power bill, about $28 more on average.

Constructing these lines is critical to positioning Midwestern states to “attract investment, create jobs, and maintain leadership in emerging technologies and industrial innovation,” as Indiana’s Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzanne Jaworowski told federal regulators. She also touted Indiana’s steadfast support of the portfolio, acknowledging it will avoid “costly inefficiencies” and enable access to all generation resources across the Midwest.
These resources are critical to sustaining economic growth. With manufacturing comprising more than 26% of the state’s GDP, Indiana’s industrial sector is the greatest electricity-consuming industry. Our state is the national leader in steelmaking as well as vehicle manufacturing, having produced about 84% of recreational vehicles sold in 2023. Further growth in these energy-intensive sectors will require considerably more electricity. But without additional transmission capacity, that growth could strain the grid, resulting in even higher electricity prices and increased risk of power outages. Building a well-planned grid is imperative to meeting challenges for decades to come.
Enabling big business for the future will require smart infrastructure decisions now. Continued investment depends upon the availability of reliable, affordable electricity that will help ensure Indiana remains an attractive place for entrepreneurial leaders.
Ultimately, Indiana joined other Midwestern stakeholders to craft a plan that will serve our collective needs. Hoosier leaders are committed to ensuring reliable, affordable, secure power, and the federal government has no business stepping in the way of our forward progress. While other states may choose alternative energy solutions, Indiana remains committed to building a grid that will enable economic prosperity well into the future.

A sign beside her reads: ""We Care. We can Help"" (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).One year ago today, Missourians voted to enshrine abortion rights into the state Constitution.
But access remains fragmented as court battles and proposed abortion bans introduce more confusion into an already complicated situation.
Procedural abortions are sporadically available at three Planned Parenthood clinics in Missouri as numerous legal fights unfold, including a question over whether restrictions on medication abortion will remain in place. Medication abortion, which accounts for about two-thirds of abortions nationwide, is completely unavailable in Missouri.
The exact number of abortions provided since the passage of Amendment 3 is not yet available. But Sam Lee, a longtime anti-abortion advocate with Campaign Life Missouri, said it seems to be “nowhere near what we had anticipated or what the supporters of Amendment 3 had anticipated.” 
While the last 12 months have seen a pitched battle over abortion rights in Missouri, the next 12 months will likely see some conclusion.


The outcome of a multi-week trial slated for January will determine which of Missouri’s longstanding abortion regulations will be upheld and which are unconstitutional under the abortion-rights amendment. Any decision will likely end up before a higher state court.
Outside the courts, lawmakers placed a new constitutional amendment on the November 2026 ballot seeking to reinstate Missouri’s abortion ban. 
“They rushed to put an abortion ban, that reads like a pro-choice amendment, back on the ballot––and they don’t think Missourians are smart enough to notice,” Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Abortion Action Missouri, said in a statement. “We know better. This time next year, Missourians will again vote against banning abortion. Hey Jeff City, it’s time you learned, no means no.”
The abortion rights amendment broadly protects reproductive health care. It also prohibits the legislature from regulating abortion prior to the point of fetal viability, which is generally the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb without extraordinary measures.
When 52% of 3 million Missouri voters supported the amendment, it opened the doors not only for broad abortion access in Missouri, but also began to lay the groundwork for access for women in nearby states with bans, including Iowa, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas. 
But the road to widespread access is complicated, in large part thanks to the state’s long history electing anti-abortion lawmakers and their focus on crafting some of the more restrictive laws in the country, known as “targeted regulation of abortion providers,” or TRAP, laws.
These regulations are the reason for the dramatic dip in abortion in Missouri before it was outlawed. And these regulations remain among the reasons abortion isn’t yet widely accessible.
A decade ago, more than 5,000 abortions were performed in Missouri, according to data from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. By 2020, that number dropped to 167 as the legislature enacted more abortion regulations.
In 2019, the Missouri legislature passed a “trigger law” that would go into effect if Roe v. Wade ever fell. When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in June 2022, Missouri enacted its trigger law, becoming the first state to ban nearly all abortion.
In the first 25 months after Roe was overturned, 74 abortions were performed in Missouri under the state’s emergency exemption, according to health department data. But data shows the ban didn’t prevent thousands of other Missourians from getting elective abortions. 
In 2023, approximately 2,860 Missourians traveled to Kansas last year for abortions, and 8,710 traveled to Illinois, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research group that closely tracks abortion data.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8174-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-11-05 07:17:33.069499

At the time expansion was implemented, many rural hospitals were already under severe financial strain. Four years later, the program delivered what voters intended: fewer uninsured patients, steadier hospital finances, and more federal dollars flowing into Missouri’s health care system. 
What hasn’t kept pace is how the state budgets its share. The expansion match belongs in the base MO HealthNet budget, not in temporary reserves.
A permanent program needs permanent funding.
Missouri’s Medicaid program now provides health coverage to more than 1.2 million residents, including roughly 358,000 low-income adults newly eligible under expansion. As a result, hospitals are paid for visits that once went uncompensated and overall charity care has declined. New mothers keep coverage for a full year after giving birth instead of losing it after eight weeks. And in rural areas, hospitals report steadier finances and fewer sudden shocks.
The federal government covers 90% of expansion costs. When adults qualify through the expansion category instead of disability, the state match drops from about 34% to 10%. Expansion did not just add people — it moved many into a less expensive category, a dynamic Washington University health economist Timothy McBride has tracked since expansion began.
When expansion began in 2021, the state received about $968 million in temporary federal incentive funding through the American Rescue Plan. Lawmakers placed that money into two reserve accounts to cover the state’s share while a permanent appropriation was developed. Those reserves helped Missouri draw $212 million in 2024 and $359.6 million in the first nine months of 2025 — now averaging about $40 million per month. 
The reserves were always a temporary bridge, never a replacement for putting the match into Missouri’s recurring Medicaid budget. As of Sept. 30, the combined balance stood at $532.2 million. At current draw rates, they could be exhausted as soon as late 2026, according to McBride. 
The budget now being drafted covers the period when those dollars run out. If lawmakers wait any longer, hospitals and patients will feel the consequences first.
Pemiscot Memorial Hospital in Hayti still faces pressure from a high share of uninsured patients and low commercial rates, making staffing and service stability difficult to maintain. More than 40% of Missouri’s rural counties no longer have labor and delivery services because thin margins cannot support obstetric staffing. When the state delays payments, cash flow tightens first in these communities already operating on thin margins.
Missouri has seen what happens when Medicaid support falters. In 2005, eligibility cuts removed more than 100,000 people from coverage. Emergency rooms absorbed the fallout. Hospital uncompensated care jumped by more than $150 million in two years as uninsured visits surged. The care didn’t disappear. It just arrived later, sicker, and costlier.
Coverage alone does not guarantee care — especially where staffing shortages and closures persist. When the nearest alternative is an hour away, budget delays in Jefferson City translate to treatment delays for patients.
During the “unwinding” — when Missouri resumed annual eligibility checks after pandemic protections ended — nearly 400,000 people were disenrolled from MO HealthNet within a year. About 70% were still eligible but lost coverage because renewal paperwork did not get completed in time. Administrative choices can destabilize coverage for hundreds of thousands even when the program itself is working.
Missouri cannot continue managing a permanent program with temporary dollars. If reserves run out without a replacement appropriation, payment delays and service disruptions become more likely. Delaying a permanent appropriation does not save money. It determines only when the bill arrives.
The state’s own fiscal outlook warns that ongoing general revenue spending will exceed ongoing revenues by more than $1 billion beginning in FY27, exhausting the remaining surplus if no adjustments are made. The budget already assumes Missouri will continue covering the expansion population. When reserve balances run low, budget writers will have fewer options, not more. Waiting invites unnecessary disruption.
Expansion eased financial pressure on rural hospitals, reduced uncompensated care, and improved operating margins. A permanent appropriation would protect those gains if federal policy or administrative performance changes.
The solution is straightforward: appropriate the expansion match in the base MO HealthNet budget, add automatic reporting and midyear review triggers if the federal match rate changes, and stop treating temporary reserves as permanent funding. These steps will ensure timely payments, predictable hospital funding, and continued access for rural Missourians.
Reserve funds covered the state share for four years. They are projected to run out in late 2026. Enrollment continues either way.
A permanent program needs permanent funding.
Expansion kept hospitals open and families insured. Missouri voters made that decision. Lawmakers must honor it by funding expansion in the budget — before instability returns, especially in rural communities that can least afford it.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medicaid-scaled-2-1536x1024-1-1024x6831745922858-1.jpg,,,2025-11-05 06:57:18.921736

Our kids deserve better than that. Wisconsin families deserve better than that,” Underly said at a press conference. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)State Superintendent Jill Underly said allegations of mishandled sexual misconduct and grooming by teachers have been turned into a “partisan political sideshow” as she announced that her agency is launching a database to list the names of teachers  who have surrendered  their licenses or had them revoked. She also laid out other actions that could be taken to improve the current system for responding to allegations.
It was the first time that Underly spoke to the public in person since the publication of a CapTimes report that found there were over 200 investigations into teacher licenses due to allegations of sexual misconduct or grooming from 2018 to 2023. The investigation led to an outcry from lawmakers, who said they want action to ensure students are safe. 
Underly was absent from the first informational hearing on the subject held in the Assembly Government Oversight, Accountability and Transparency (GOAT) committee about two weeks ago. She was out of state to accept an award from her alma mater Indiana University. 
Underly told reporters at a press conference ahead of the hearing Tuesday in the Senate Education Committee that she was interested in “protecting Wisconsin’s children” whether they are in public, private or charter schools and she called on policymakers to work towards solutions and stay away from “finger pointing” and “political theater.” 
“It’s been deeply disappointing to see attempts to turn this serious issue into yet another partisan political sideshow. Our kids deserve better than that. Wisconsin families deserve better than that,” Underly said. “But we won’t be distracted or deterred, and our focus remains exactly where it belongs on protecting kids.” 
Underly’s comments come after U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, a Republican gubernatorial hopeful, who stood alongside state Republican lawmakers, suggested during a press conference that Gov. Tony Evers needed to “call on Jill Underly to either do her job or step aside” and connected the issue of sexual misconduct and grooming to “indoctrination” through liberal curriculum in schools. Washington County Executive and gubernatorial hopeful Josh Schoemann outright called for Underly’s resignation. 
Underly told reporters that calls for her resignation are “preposterous.” 
Underly said she will also attend the Joint Audit Committee hearing on Wednesday where lawmakers plan to launch an audit into the educational licensure revocation, suspension, restriction and investigation at DPI. 
During both the press conference and the committee hearing, Underly rejected claims that the agency is shielding information from the public, but said there is more work that can be done to strengthen the agency and the state’s current processes.
“The department does not cover up misconduct. We do not shield information from the public. We do not ignore allegations. We do everything in our power to remove those who harm children from classrooms, and we do it urgently and decisively,” Underly said. “Unfortunately, some have chosen to use this deeply sensitive issue to score political points and that doesn’t protect children. It distracts from real solutions.”
Sen. John Jagler (R-Watertown), who chairs the Senate Education Committee, opened the Senate hearing by saying that the response by DPI, including Underly’s absence from the GOAT committee hearing, was “disturbing” to him.
“The bottom line is kids’ safety needs to be the No. 1 priority, full stop, and I believe that’s what we hope to investigate today and look into how we can help make this a better situation for our kids,” Sen. John Jagler said. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)
“The bottom line is kids’ safety needs to be the No. 1 priority, full stop, and I believe that’s what we hope to investigate today and look into how we can help make this a better situation for our kids,” Jagler said. 
Underly said there are several “practical” and “achievable” steps her agency is taking and Wisconsin policymakers could take to bolster safety for students.
Defining grooming 
One of the top steps that Underly identified is for the state to define “grooming” in state law. She said that the agency already investigates and pursues license revocations for teachers accused of grooming students for sexual exploitation and for predatory behavior, but clarifying a definition could help ensure consistency. 
“Grooming and predatory behaviors are not just school issues. They are societal issues that happen in every corner of our communities, and that’s why we need to do more as a state to prevent, identify and address these behaviors wherever they occur,” Underly said. “Without stronger laws and clear definitions, the referrals we receive can be inconsistent. Wisconsin urgently needs to clarify grooming and define it as a crime so that law enforcement can act swiftly and consistently, no matter where it happens.”
A bill, coauthored by Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) and Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp), would define “grooming” in state statute and make it a felony to engage in grooming a child for sexual activity.
Underly said she welcomes conversations about the bill.
Under the bill, “grooming” would be defined as “a course of conduct, pattern of behavior, or series of acts with the intention to condition, seduce, solicit, lure, or entice a child for the purpose of engaging in sexual intercourse or sexual contact, or for the purpose of producing, distributing, or possessing depictions of the child engaged in sexually explicit conduct.” 
It also lists examples of behavior that would constitute grooming including verbal comments or conversations of a sexual nature directed at a child; inappropriate or sexualized physical contact; written, electronic and communication over text and social media to lure or entice a child; promising gifts, privileges, or special attention to lower a child’s inhibitions or create emotional dependence; and acts intended to isolate a child from family or peers. 
The authors of the bill said in a memo that the bill builds on the state laws on grooming that exist in Florida, Texas, Ohio and Illinois. 
A person convicted of a grooming charge would be guilty of a Class G felony, that would increase to a Class F felony if the person is in a position of trust or authority, and to a Class E felony if the child has a disability and to a Class D felony if the violation involves two or more children. A convicted person would also need to register as a sex offender.
Other agency and legislative steps
Lawmakers on the committee also asked about the number of staff dedicated to investigating allegations. 
Underly said they have 1.5 employees working on license investigations and those employees have access to the agency’s team of attorneys. 
Jagler asked whether that was sufficient. 
Underly said it would be helpful to have more resources, though she emphasized that providing subpoena power to the agency would help speed investigations along. 
“We need to strengthen our investigations today. The DPI lacks subpoena power during investigations, meaning we rely on voluntary cooperation of witnesses, district officials, and others to gather critical information,” Underly said. “Even limited authority would allow us to gather evidence more efficiently and act faster to protect kids.” 
Deputy State Superintendent Tom McCarthy noted during the hearing that the agency can become involved in any stage of the process of dealing with allegations, but it is not typically the primary investigator in cases. 
“Most of the time, we are being notified by law enforcement, by county child welfare, by a district who has subsequently said, ‘Hey, we have a teacher who is being investigated by law enforcement or there’s a scenario over here.’
The agency’s role focuses on investigating whether an educator’s license should be removed or whether they should seek a voluntary surrender from someone under investigation. During investigations, McCarthy said the agency typically relies on gathering credible information from law enforcement, school districts, local partners and others. He said even if there isn’t information readily available to be shared with the agency they are still working to “go after these people.”

“What’s happening with the 1.5 staff is, they’re often following up, saying, ‘Hey, sheriff’s department, have you completed this? Hey, school district, are you done with this particular investigation.’ Without subpoena power, we’re doing that in a voluntary fashion with them. Sometimes they tell us to pound sand, and we have to wait and we have to wait and wait and wait. Sometimes we get tired of waiting and actually, just move into a voluntary surrender or revocation action, but it would be way better for the system if we weren’t always way delayed in the back seat of this entire process so that we could take swifter action.”
Underly said the agency is also working on a statewide code of conduct, which will soon be published for public comment through administrative rules and will serve as a guide for school boards developing policies on professional boundaries. 
DPI has a model policy on its website for school districts, but it isn’t mandatory. 
“That’s something you all would have to talk about as to whether you want that to be more than just recommended on the website,” said Jennifer Kammerud, who serves as DPI’s educator licensing director.
Another step, Underly said, includes the launch of a new online database to allow the public to view licenses that have been revoked or surrendered. She said the new tool will create more transparency by expanding on the current teacher license lookup tool. 
Currently, the public can see the status of a teacher’s  license on the primary database, a teacher’s name is required to check a license status. The new database lists names of individuals in alphabetical order who have voluntarily surrendered or had their licenses revoked. 
McCarthy said it would be a little while before the website is updated with information about the reasoning behind license revocation or surrender because the information is not electronic yet. He said DPI must locate individual revocation orders and will add the information as it is gathered.
In addition, Underly said that the state needs to modernize the licensing system used for educators, but the agency needs resources to get it done. She said that allowing DPI to keep 10% of licensing fees, which is currently diverted away from the agency, would allow investments in licensing improvements and investigations. 
The agency also requested $600,000 in the most recent state budget process to modernize its online background checks and licensing platform, but that was rejected by the Republican-led Legislature. 
During the hearing Republican lawmakers questioned why Underly hadn’t come specifically to them with her requests. (During the most recent budget process, the Joint Finance Committee, which typically hosts agency heads to explain their budget requests, declined to invite Underly or DPI to make a presentation.)
“Obviously, I’ll never tell you how to do your job, Superintendent, but you mentioned requesting for funding — how [Joint Finance Committee] has never asked you to come talk to them. I guess in my experience [Department of Safety and Professional Standards] Sec. Dan [Hereth] was in my office asking and explaining those things,” said Sen. Romaine Quinn (R-Birchwood), who is a member of the Joint Finance Committee. “I would just say no one is going to ask you to come in and ask for more money.” 
Underly also said the state needs to close loopholes for private schools. Educators employed at private schools in Wisconsin are not required to hold a DPI license, meaning staff at those schools fall outside of the agency’s investigative authority. The agency is only able to investigate and keep individuals out of schools via the licensure system.
Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) emphasized that he wanted discussions about improving the process to cover students in public, private and other schools. 
“I would hope that as we focus our attention on what is happening in the public domain, and what information is publicly available and was pulled off of a public website, and then publicly reported, that we don’t pretend that because things are private and happening in private schools and behind closed doors that the 125,000 students who are in classrooms where there is not a required licensure and where there is not required reporting and where information is not public, that we pretend that there are not problems that exist there,” Larson said. 
At one point during the committee hearing, Larson asked his colleagues whether they would want to work to help close the loophole. Sen. Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi) nodded.
“It’s a dangerous loophole and we need to close it,” Underly said.

Lindee Rae Brill (R-Sheboygan Falls) testifies about her bill to ban the use of absentee ballot drop boxes. (Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)At a public hearing of the Wisconsin Assembly Committee on Campaigns and Elections Tuesday, legislators engaged in an occasionally tense debate over proposed changes to the state election system. 
In attendance at the hearing were some of Wisconsin’s most prominent election deniers, including former state Rep. Janel Brandtjen and Peter Bernegger, a self-styled elections investigator who has been convicted of mail fraud Bernegger stood in the back of the hearing room with a group of companions, muttering and complaining about assertions by the election clerks and legislators who testified. 
The committee heard testimony on bills that would prohibit the use of absentee ballot drop boxes, change the system for how “indefinitely confined voters” cast ballots, add a provision to state law that makes it a felony if election workers don’t allow election observers to exercise their rights and change the system for how state agencies manage voter registration data. 
The most heated part of the hearing came during the discussion of AB 560, authored by Rep. Lindee Rae Brill (R-Sheboygan Falls) and Sen. Andre Jacque (R-New Franken), which outlaws drop boxes. The use of drop boxes has been a politically charged issue since 2020, when right-wing groups started to allege they’re susceptible to fraud and “ballot harvesting” by outfits known as “ballot mills” that allegedly collect illegal ballots and stuff them into drop boxes in order to sway election results. There is no evidence such harvesting happens, though in Wisconsin it is now illegal for anyone other than a voter to return that voter’s absentee ballot. 
Since 2020, the drop box issue has been litigated in the court system more than once. In 2022, the then-conservative-controlled Wisconsin Supreme Court banned drop boxes. In 2024 the new liberal majority on the Court reversed that decision and drop boxes were allowed in last year’s presidential election. Municipal clerks are able to decide whether or not to use the boxes and the Wisconsin Elections Commission has issued guidance for best practices in securing them, but there are no laws on the books guiding how drop boxes should be managed. 
Brill cited incidents in Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Canada in which absentee ballot drop boxes were set on fire, saying those events show the need for the boxes to have security that the state of Wisconsin and its municipalities can’t afford to provide.
Democrats on the committee asked why isolated anecdotes on the west coast have anything to do with the administration of drop boxes in Wisconsin and argued that the reason many Wisconsinites still have doubts about the security of the state’s elections is because Republicans keep pushing the belief that something is amiss. 
“I would argue that the No. 1 reason that people may have a lack of confidence in the security of our elections is the discourse that conservative members of the Republican Party continue to put out there about fact versus fiction when it comes to actual election security and fraud,” Rep. Lee Snodgrass (D-Appleton) said. 
“I think it’s no secret that the people who are talking about elections being stolen or somehow insecure are people who are grabbing on to conspiracy theories that are not based in fact about actual incidences of election fraud in this country,” Snodgrass continued, citing a 2022 Associated Press survey of election officials about the security of drop boxes. 
“I don’t know that I consider that a valid source, Associated Press,” Brill replied. “I don’t always see everything from the Associated Press being absolutely valid, but that might be where you and I find truth in different spots. This might be where we’re finding facts in different locations.”
The criticism of Brill’s bill didn’t just come from the committee’s Democrats. Rep. Scott Krug (R-Nekoosa), who has often worked to broker compromise on election issues, questioned Brill’s choice to put forward the bill despite the near certainty that it will be vetoed by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. 
Krug said if Republicans move forward with the bill and it passes both chambers only to be vetoed in early 2026 and then the state is left in the same position — drop boxes are allowed at the discretion of local election clerks without any rules or regulations guiding their use, security or procedures. 
“[This bill is] not going to change the Supreme Court’s opinion on drop boxes. It’s not going to change the governor’s opinion on drop boxes,” Krug said. “We still have a problem in our communities, and that’s what I’m trying to get to is, politically, where we are dealing with realities. We know that if this bill leaves this committee, goes to the floor, gets voted on, goes to the Senate, gets through committee, gets voted on in the Senate, goes to the governor’s desk, he vetoes it — then where are we with drop boxes?”
Brill said more than once that she doesn’t think Republicans in the Legislature should be trying to write election-related bills that can be signed into law by Evers. 
“I don’t believe that doing election integrity that the governor is going to sign is what Republicans should be doing,” she said. “I think election integrity is something that is a very divided issue, and I think we’re on the right side of this issue. So if the governor was going to say he was going to sign, I mean, I am a believer in God and follower of Jesus Christ, so do I believe that there’s a chance that he would change his mind and sign this into law? Sure, but I’m taking this head-on, because our Republican president believes this is the direction we should be heading.”
A number of election clerks also testified on the bill, questioning the assertion that drop boxes are less secure than U.S. Postal Service mailboxes and insisting that allegations of ballot harvesting are false. 
Indefinitely confined voters 
Since the 1970s, Wisconsin law has allowed voters to identify themselves as indefinitely confined, meaning they’re unable to leave the house to vote so their local election clerk automatically sends them an absentee ballot for each election. 
When the state instituted its voter ID law in 2011, indefinitely confined voters were exempted from its requirements. In 2020, the use of indefinitely confined status increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, raising concerns among Republicans that the program is susceptible to fraud. 
AB 599 would end the indefinitely confined program by Jan. 1, 2029 and replace it with a program that allows voters with disabilities or illnesses to request that absentee ballots be automatically sent to them and provide proof of identification. That request would be valid until the ID’s expiration, at which time the voter will need to start the process again with their new ID. 
The bill’s Republican authors, Krug and Rep. Cindy Duchow (R-Town of Delafield), said the proposal was “not a rollback” but a “recalibration” of the system. But Democrats and advocates for people with disabilities argued the state has barriers that can make it difficult for people with disabilities to obtain a state-issued ID, mostly due to challenges with DMV hours and transportation access.
Election clerks testified that the bill pushes a major burden of added work onto the local clerks. 
Election observers
AB 426, authored by Rep. Paul Tittl, would penalize any election official who infringes on an election observer’s rights to be within three and eight feet of all aspects of the voting process with up to 90 days imprisonment in county jail and a fine of up to $1,000. 
Snodgrass pointed to a recently enacted administrative rule that guides the conduct of election observers and gives  election officials authority to manage observer conduct. She said the state should wait to see how the rules work before further tweaking the law. 
Voter data 
The committee also heard testimony on AB 595, authored by Krug, which would change how the state elections commission works with other agencies to share data such as a voter’s name and state ID number. Republicans have spent years complaining that the state voter registration list is full of errors. Democrats and election administration experts have said aggressive attempts to delete data from the statewide system would result in the disenfranchisement of Wisconsin voters. 
The bill would require the Department of Transportation and WEC to enter into a data-sharing agreement to match information in the possession of both agencies. 
Under current law, whenever a voter is no longer eligible to vote, for any reason, their file is changed to ineligible on the voter registration list but not removed. This prevents people from being removed in error and allows people to retain their voter registration file if they’re convicted of a felony and then can vote again after serving their sentence. 
Krug’s bill would remove people from the list once they’re declared ineligible. If someone is then eligible to vote again, they’d have to re-register. 
The bill would also require the Legislative Audit Bureau to conduct an audit every other year of the official voter list to search for registered voters who aren’t U.S. citizens. While Republicans have of fraud by non-citizen who illegally cast ballots, there is little proof it happens at a significant rate.
Krug said that a lot of election skeptics’ complaints have simmered for years without the ability to provide definitive answers about their validity because the data can’t be compiled, so his bill is trying to solve that. 
“Is it a widespread problem? No. Does it happen? Yes,” Krug said. “So that’s what I’m trying to figure out, is, what is that in between? What does it look like? … This is not a gotcha. I just want to be able to say, ‘OK, agency gave me data, I can show you that this isn’t a major problem,’ and then I can come up with solutions.”

The Trump administration proposes to amend the 3.6 million-acre Resource Management Plan to include more access for fossil fuel extraction.
The post Feds extend comment for vast Rock Springs public land management area appeared first on WyoFile .","The U.S. Bureau of Land Management has extended a public comment period regarding potential changes to a management plan that covers 3.6 million acres of public land in southwest Wyoming.
The agency proposes to amend the Rock Springs Resource Management Plan to include more access for fossil fuel extraction and will accept “scoping” comments through Dec. 18 — a 45-day extension.
The plan was updated in December 2024 under the Biden administration, and it set off a firestorm of criticism from conservative critics and key politicians for being overly restrictive. The BLM, under the Trump administration, said it “determined that the special management designations and their associated mineral restrictions within the field office are inconsistent with recent executive orders and need to be reviewed.”

Those Trump executive orders include Unleashing American Energy and Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry.
Conservation groups say public lands in the Rock Springs region are now at risk of the BLM prioritizing development over conservation — a threat to vital wildlife habitat. Although the 2024 plan still technically — and legally — guides management in the area, including limits on energy development in certain areas, the agency appears to be moving forward with plans that run counter to those prescriptions.
A federal oil and gas lease auction, set for June, includes several parcels encompassing 19,839 acres in the Golden Triangle — a sanctuary for the greater sage grouse and other wildlife, according to a Rocky Mountain Wild analysis — as well as parcels that overlap state-protected ungulate migration corridors in the southwest planning area.
A public meeting regarding the proposed plan amendment is scheduled for Dec. 3, from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., at the Sweetwater Events Complex in Rock Springs.Visit this BLM website to learn more about the proposed amendment and to submit a comment.

By backing anti-chemtrail legislation, the Freedom Caucus is making a hard run for an Oscar nomination in the theater of the absurd, writes columnist Rod Miller.
The post What’s next from the Wyoming Freedom Caucus? Tinfoil Stetsons? appeared first on WyoFile .","Just when you thought Wyoming politics couldn’t get any weirder, the Freedom Caucus proclaims, “Hold our beer!” The Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Agriculture Committee, under the heavy thumb of the Freedom Caucus conspiracy theorists, tightened their tinfoil Stetsons and advanced an interim bill that outlaws — wait for it — chemtrails!

Opinion

I’ll digress for a moment to offer my personal and professional gratitude to the Wyoming Freedom Caucus. Whenever I am at a loss for column fodder or for something in Big Empty politics to satirize or ridicule, the WFC always comes up with a new boneheaded move that perfectly satisfies.
Now, back to “chemtrails.” Contrails have been around for quite some time. You can probably recall old photographs of Allied bombers over Nazi Germany, and the feathery, linear clouds that stream out behind the bomber formations. They’re the same things you see today, when you see an airliner at cruising altitude on its way to who knows where. They’re what happens when water vapor from a jet’s hot exhaust condenses into ice crystals or clouds.
Online flat-earthers claim, without a shred of credible evidence, that contrails are really “chemtrails” resulting from deepstate hooligans trying to poison us with nano-particles of nonsense.
For some reason, this phenomenon has the Freedom Caucus’ skivvies in a bunch, and they felt they needed to plant their feet and put a stop to this conspiracy. Or at least make it illegal in Wyoming. So they arm-twisted the Joint Ag Committee into pushing the “Clean Air and Geoengineering Prohibition Act” to keep all us cowgirls and cowboys safe from Communism sprayed on us from above.
A recent Joint Ag Committee interim hearing on this goofball legislation was further evidence that the Freedom Caucus is bucking for an Oscar nomination in the theater of the absurd.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)
The committee ignored testimony from the head of the University of Wyoming Atmospheric Science Department when he tried to debunk the “chemtrail” myth with real, actual science. But their ears picked up when a disgraced YouTube podcaster validated their paranoia and told them exactly what they wanted to hear.
To combat the threat they believe “chemtrails” pose to the Cowboy State, the committee played fast and loose with the Tenth Amendment and claimed, contrary to federal law, that the state of Wyoming enjoys sovereignty over the airspace above it. I guess they want to establish some sort of Golden Dome over the 307, so we can shoot down invading aircraft that try to spray us with strange and mysterious vapors.
This would not bode at all well for the Air Force Thunderbirds at the Frontier Days Airshow when they wow the crowd with their loops and barrel rolls and, for the finale, pop smoke and release “chemtrails” over the unsuspecting throng.
And it might dampen enthusiasm for Freedom Caucus cupbearer Rep. John Bear’s notion that Wyoming can replace revenue lost to Freedom Caucus tax cuts by selling more jet fuel to zillionaires who patrol the Wyoming skies in their Gulfstreams and Learjets. It would only take one overzealous “chemtrail” patriot shooting down an executive’s jet that he thought was poisoning his family to give a black eye to that whole program.
The Freedom Caucus’ tilted flat earth is a slippery slope, indeed. What’s next? Maybe legislation naming Bigfoot as our official state biped? Or a posthumous pardon for Lee Harvey Oswald, because everyone knows the CIA killed JFK? How about a law against Jewish Space Lasers and the threat they pose to our kids? The possibilities boggle the mind.
Let’s face facts. The only political card the Freedom Caucus has in its hand to play is fear. If they can fear-monger us into believing that only they can protect us from boogeymen like “chemtrails,” their election certificates are secure.
But once we realize that Freedom Caucus fears are mere paranoia, and their manufactured boogeymen simply aren’t real, then they skate on very thin political ice.
This upcoming campaign season will be pretty interesting and entertaining. I can’t wait for the Freedom Caucus to take its theater of the absurd on the road to town halls at the end of our long, dusty roads. I can foresee them creating new boogeymen to scare us into voting for them, and hearing enlightened chuckles from citizens with working bullshit detectors.
Confronted with ridicule for their goofiness, Freedom Caucus flat-earthers will stomp and bluster and tell us we’re all doomed. And they won’t even remove their tinfoil Stetsons for the Pledge of Allegiance.

Adrian Smith and Mike Flood at St. Teresa Catholic School in Lincoln on Sep. 29. 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — President Donald Trump weighed in on two Nebraska congressional races with the 2026 midterms still a year away. 
Trump — via separate posts on his Truth Social platform — endorsed Nebraska Republican U.S. Reps. Adrian Smith and Mike Flood. 
In Smith’s case, the endorsement could help Smith, of Gering, further separate himself from 3rd Congressional District GOP primary challenger David Huebner, a former border patrol agent, in a district that includes most of central and western Nebraska and some of the eastern edges of the state. The winner of the GOP primary will likely face Democrat Becky Stille in the general election.

Smith represents the state’s most conservative district. He has been in Congress since 2007. Before that, Smith served in the Legislature from 1999 to 2007. He is on the House Ways and Means Committee, Congress’ tax-writing committee. 
Flood, who represents the 1st Congressional District in Lincoln and other parts of eastern Nebraska, has no Republican challenger, although some in GOP circles have discussed the possibility that former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry might be interested in considering running for his old job. Flood replaced Fortenberry after Fortenberry resigned following a criminal conviction in California that was later overturned on a technicality and dropped by the Trump administration.
Flood, assuming he remains unopposed, would face Democratic challenger Eric Moyer. Flood has been in Congress since 2021. He was a speaker of the Legislature from 2007 to 2013 and returned to the Legislature a second time. Flood recently became the chair of the House GOP’s Main Street Caucus. The 1st District comprises 12 Nebraska counties, including Lancaster County. But Lincoln’s heavily Democratic lean is drowned out by more conservative rural regions.  
The two Trump posts are similar. The president pointed to Flood being a “successful businessman” and “highly respected speaker of the Nebraska Legislature.” He touted Smith for being a member of the “powerful Ways & Means Committee.” Trump credited both for cutting taxes and regulations and for keeping the border secure. 
The posts about Flood and Smith end with Trump writing that both have his “Complete and Total Endorsement for Re-Election.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout) Days after thousands of Tennessee families lost monthly federal food benefits, Gov. Bill Lee announced he would direct $5 million in state funding to food banks.
Lee said Tuesday that funding will come from savings accrued in TennCare, the state’s Medicaid program for the poor, disabled and elderly, and be distributed to regions based on the population of individuals who rely on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. SNAP provides monthly cash benefits loaded onto debit cards to buy food at grocery stores.  
Second Harvest Food Bank will be the main group distributing the funds, which should begin arriving at other food banks within days, he said. The Governor’s Office of Faith-Based Initiatives, which receives state funds but is not considered a government agency, came up with the plan for distributing funds.
“This whole federal shutdown problem has created a tremendous hardship for a lot of Tennesseans. It’s disappointing that it’s happened. It’s frustrating to people, including myself. It needs to come to an end. The government needs to open up,” Lee said.
A spokesperson for Second Harvest Food Bank of Middle Tennessee, the state’s largest hunger relief organization, said Tuesday that the organization is awaiting additional information from the governor’s office. 
Despite bipartisan lawmakers’ urging, Lee declines to bridge SNAP freeze with state dollars

“We are waiting, ourselves, for clarification from the governor on this announcement.” Pearce Baringer, a spokesperson, said via email.”We expect a letter from his office in the next week with more information.”
About 690,000 Tennesseans living in poverty, nearly half of them children, rely on the SNAP to buy food; in total, Tennessee distributes $145 million in SNAP benefits each month.
In October, the Trump administration announced a benefits freeze, for the first time in the program’s history, due to the government shutdown. 
Two federal courts said the freezing of SNAP benefits was illegal. Trump and the White House have subsequently issued conflicting statements about whether they will comply with the court orders.
“SNAP BENEFITS….will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before! Thank you for your attention to this matter,” Trump posted on Truth Social Tuesday morning.
But Tuesday afternoon, a White House spokesperson said the federal government would comply with the orders and distribute partial November payments to SNAP recipients. No timeline was provided.
A defiant Trump vows no SNAP payments until Democrats cave on shutdown

Clarence Carter, commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Human Services, said that his department received “some guidance” from the U.S. Department of Agriculture regarding the distribution of benefits. 
“We are working around the clock to recalibrate our entire system to comply with the court order and USDA guidance,” Carter told Lee during a budget hearing Tuesday. 
Once Tennessee gets the green light to load SNAP debit cards with cash benefits, the Department of Human Services can typically deliver recipient data to an outside vendor within 24 hours, a department spokesperson said.  The vendor “will need time to process the file and distribute benefits,” an operation that will take an estimated additional three days.  
Advocates have noted that food banks across the state don’t have the capacity to serve all those impacted by the SNAP benefits freeze. For every meal a food bank can provide, SNAP provides nine, according to Feeding America.

SNAP benefits are likely to consume a far larger chunk of the Tennessee budget. 
Until now the federal government has paid half of the $128 million in administrative costs Tennessee incurs to run the program and picked up the tab for the entire $145 million in monthly cash benefits, according to 2023 data published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Under Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill Act, the federal government will shift half the cost of administering the program to states, and a portion of the benefit costs.
Carter said Tuesday that Tennessee taxpayers will have to pay $77 million more annually to cover the administrative costs. He did not provide an estimate on the portion of benefits Tennessee will have to pay next year. Under new federal law, states will have to pick up a share of the benefit costs that depends on error rates in their processing of SNAP benefits.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s Department of Correction is seeking a $13 million contract increase for the state’s private-prison company amid questions about a riot and federal civil rights investigation.
Correction Commissioner Frank Strada did not mention the boost for Brentwood-based CoreCivic during Tuesday budget hearings with Gov. Bill Lee. But it is part of an $86 million increase the department is requesting for fiscal 2026-27, which would push its annual operating budget to $1.57 billion.
Strada, who has repeatedly called CoreCivic a state “partner,” said afterward the contract increase is necessary to deal with the “inflationary costs built into the contract” with the prison operator, in addition to “parity” for CoreCivic staff that would enable it to match Department of Correction pay. It would bump the private company’s contracts to a total of $243 million next year.
“We want to make sure they have adequate staffing just like we do because they’re a partner in this process,” Strada said.

CoreCivic is one of the largest political spenders in Tennessee. From 2010 to 2024 the private prison company spent more than $2.7 million to lobby lawmakers and made another $1 million in campaign contributions, according to the Lookout’s political spending database.
The company donated nearly $50,000 to Lee during his two campaigns for governor.
CoreCivic has come under fire repeatedly for a high staff turnover rate and high death rates at the four prisons it runs for the state. One of its facilities, Trousdale Turner, is under investigation by the Department of Justice for civil rights violations stemming from violence, murders and other problems at the prison.
A riot took place at Middle Tennessee’s Trousdale Turner this summer when inmates commandeered an inner yard, destroyed property and refused to take orders, leading to injuries for three inmates and the stabbing of a staff member.
The state has levied more than $45 million in penalties against the company since 2022 for failing to meet contractual requirements, mainly for staffing shortfalls. The state penalized CoreCivic by reducing its contract payout, by $4.6 million in 2024 and more than $2 million in 2025. 
Republican lawmakers started to raise concerns about CoreCivic this year, passing legislation that would force the company to lose inmates if death rates at its prisons exceed those of state-run facilities.
Sen. Heidi Campbell of Nashville is among Democratic lawmakers critical of private companies running state prisons.
U.S. Department of Justice opens investigation into CoreCivic Trousdale County prison

Campbell said today that she understands the reality of inflation but that a $13 million increase for CoreCivic ignores the “deeper structural problem” of the state’s incentive system.
“Private prison contracts reward occupancy, not outcomes – so simply increasing payments to a for-profit operator won’t meaningfully improve safety, rehabilitation or conditions,” Campbell said. “Until the contract’s incentive structure is redesigned to prioritize human and community outcomes rather than bed-count revenue, more money risks perpetuating the very overcrowded, dangerous and poorly-monitored environment threatening prisoner and employee safety.”
The state is set to put $1.7 million more into behavioral health contracts for prisons next fiscal year, but it’s unclear how much of that would go to the private prisons, which make up 16% of the Department of Correction budget.

The Idaho Legislature’s powerful Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC for short, is conducting three days of budget workshops this week in Boise in preparation for the 2026 legislative session that begins Jan. 12. 
JFAC is responsible for setting all the budgets for all state agencies and departments once the legislative session convenes in January. 
However, the financial and budgetary landscape has fundamentally changed since fiscal year 2022, when Idaho’s state budget had a record surplus estimated at $2 billion.
Now, the state of Idaho’s general fund budget is projected to end the current fiscal year 2026 on June 30 with a deficit of $49.3 million, according to budget documents state staffers shared with JFAC on Tuesday. 
Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls (Photo courtesy of the Idaho Legislature)
Legislators said they won’t allow a budget deficit to occur and will use their authority to take steps during the 2026 session to prevent a deficit
“Instead of deciding how much we’re going to add to budgets, by and large we will be deciding how much we will trim,” said Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls. “So it will be a very different mindset that we will have.”
Horman and Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, serve as the two co-chairs of JFAC.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little has already ordered state agencies, other than the K-12 public school system, to reduce spending by 3% during the current fiscal year due to revenue shortfalls. While the governor can order agencies to reduce spending, only the Idaho Legislature has the authority to set the budget.
 Why is Idaho’s general fund state budget projecting to run a budget deficit?

The revenue shortfall is occurring after the Idaho Legislature and Little reduced revenue by more than $450 million during the 2025 legislative session in order to pay for tax cuts and a new private education tax credit. 
During the 2025 legislative session, JFAC members also delayed setting their revenue projection until after the Idaho Legislature signed off on its largest tax cuts and JFAC had approved more than $5 billion in spending – a move criticized by some members of both political parties.

The projected state budget deficit does not include the costs of conforming to tax changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Congress passed this summer or more than $100 million in supplemental funding requests that the Legislature will consider during the 2026 session. The Idaho Legislature will ultimately decide whether and how to conform with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and whether to approve the supplemental budget requests. 
The Idaho Constitution requires the Idaho Legislature to pass a balanced budget where expenses do not exceed revenue. 
Unless revenues reverse course and start exceeding forecasts, the Idaho Legislature will need to intervene to avoid an unconstitutional budget deficit. 
Those options include:

Cutting spending.
Dipping into nearly $1.7 billion worth of rainy day savings accounts and unobligated cash.
Raising taxes or fees, or otherwise increasing revenue. 

Given conservative Republicans, who have spent years cutting taxes, control a supermajority in both chambers of the Idaho Legislature, increasing taxes does not seem realistic politically. 
That leaves cutting spending and dipping into rainy days savings and cash on hand as potential tools the Idaho Legislature will deploy to avoid a budget deficit before the current fiscal year ends June 30. 
The budget picture doesn’t become any easier in the coming years either. Graphs and charts legislative budget staffers presented Tuesday showed the gap between expenditures and revenues is projected to widen in the upcoming 2027 and 2028 fiscal years. 
One general fund budget scenario presented Tuesday by Legislative Services Office Budget and Policy Analysis Manager Keith Bybee listed an estimated deficit of $555.2 million for fiscal year 2027.
Still, Bybee said the Idaho Legislature is well positioned because of its rainy day reserve savings accounts and a history of making conservative budget decisions.
“All solvable – we have solutions,” Bybee said. “We have plenty of money in reserves. We have other options.”

Horman stressed Tuesday that JFAC and the Idaho Legislature have not violated the Idaho Constitution’s balanced budget requirement. 
Horman pointed out the projected deficit is merely a forecast on paper and that what matters is where the budget stands at the end of the fiscal year on June 30.
Horman also said she has seen an opinion from the Idaho Attorney General’s Office indicating the state reserve funds count as revenue. 
Throughout Tuesday’s hearing, some members of JFAC and staffers frequently used phrases like “right size government” and even heralded a return to the “good old days,” when state budget writers focused on funding only needs, not wants.

But Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Juliet Charron used plain language to describe how her department will navigate the new budget realities within the Medicaid program.  
“We are at a point where we need to make difficult decisions,” Charron told JFAC members.
In addition to budget and revenue briefings, Tuesday’s agenda included a hosted buffet dinner for JFAC members at the downtown Boise steakhouse Hemlock, which was paid for by Regence BlueShield, an insurer that began managing the state health insurance contract in 2024.
JFAC meetings are scheduled to continue Wednesday and Thursday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise and Boise State University.

They put the food in white styrofoam containers so kids who’d eat the food later that evening wouldn’t know it came from a free food program.
The organization started a meal train to provide hot meals for families in the area after the federal government shutdown delayed Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for thousands of West Virginians.
“I’ve always been someone who really cares about children and how they feel, and it dawned on me that some of these middle school and high school kids aren’t going to want to be seen by their peers at a free meal provided by the community,” said Felisha Hartwell, executive director of Reachh. “So, we decided to make grab and go meals for everybody to make sure people still have their dignity.”
The group has accepted donations from local churches, community members and more to pay for hot meals on week nights and to fill up the group’s food pantry. 
In Summers County, one in five kids rely on SNAP to eat, Hartwell said.
“We want to do everything we can to make sure our children have full bellies,” she said. “We can’t continue to do this long term because it’s a huge undertaking.”

Child hunger is a problem in West Virginia: roughly one in five kids don’t have enough food. Nearly every county offers free breakfast and lunch to children because of the state’s high poverty rate. 
Around 40% of SNAP recipients in the state are children, whose benefits didn’t show up Nov. 1.
Janna Estep, a mother of three young kids in Oak Hill, uses SNAP to buy milk, bread, eggs, cheese and more. She just used her remaining SNAP benefits to buy what she could at the grocery store and plans to go to a local pantry soon.
“My deep freezer is about to be empty,” she said. 
The Trump administration said it will use contingency funds to pay reduced SNAP benefits but that could take months. 
West Virginia will have to calculate the new benefit amount for roughly 275,000 residents who use SNAP, and Gov. Patrick Morrisey said Tuesday that he would press the state’s outside SNAP vendor to process benefits as quickly as possible. It may take an estimated four to seven days for the state’s vendor to get the system operational again, the governor said. 
Morrisey so far has declined to directly fund SNAP to provide the full benefits amount, saying the state’s vendor that processes the benefits can’t accept a direct cash infusion. He sent around $8 million to food banks so far to meet a growing need and expects to transfer another $2.5 million to food banks this week.
“We had a lot of first time families that have never needed us before,” said Amanda Bolyard,  chair of the In-School Pantry Program in Monongalia County that stocks school pantries for students. She also volunteers with Pantry Plus More, which works to eliminate child hunger in the area. 
“There’s a big misunderstanding and stigma around poverty. There are a lot of working poor people who are working and cannot make ends meet,” she said. “We have been making sure those in school pantries are well stocked … We definitely don’t want hungry kids.”
Jim McKay, state coordinator for Prevent Child Abuse West Virginia, said his partners are very concerned about the delayed SNAP benefits’ negative impacts on child welfare. 
“Research shows that when there’s an economic shock on a family, that can be particularly problematic in increasing the risk of child maltreatment,” McKay said. “ … All of these things just add more stress to the families. And ultimately, child abuse prevention is about reducing stress on families.”
An effort to stock school pantries for children
Raleigh County United for Prevention Director Kellie Gunnoe said that Morrisey’s food funding was necessary as they’ve seen a 50% increase in need due to the delayed SNAP benefits and unpaid federal workers. Her organization is stocking school food pantries across the county with items kids can take home to eat.
“We get meals that can be microwaved like Easy Mac. They have something they can make by themselves,” she said. 
Families without cars can’t make it to pantries, Gunnoe said, so her organization is working with school counselors to make sure kids have food for after school. 
“In those rural places that are outside of Beckley, they’re just without,” she said. “We’re just having to be creative on how we get things from point A to B.”
Pantry Plus More is hosting mobile food pantries in Monongalia County for families who are referred through the local school system. The group held a food giveaway in Westover last weekend where they gave away food boxes and meat. 
“We were expecting to serve 225 families, and we ended up serving 340 families. Volunteers were packing boxes on the fly to make sure these families were fed,” Bolyard said. 
In Elkins, local restaurants have teamed up to offer a free meal to kids every night of the week for the month of November. The initiative was the brainchild of Emily Watson, who owns Clementine’s Cantina with her husband.
“I was worried about how some children would eat in our area …  I think they’re the most vulnerable group they can’t really provide for themselves. I easily found plenty of people to cover the days,” she said, adding that restaurants are covering the cost of meals out of their own budgets, which can be a strain. 
“It is very much needed apparently because Saturday one of the restaurants fed 80 kids, Sunday we fed 67. Last night, we fed 120,” Watson said.

Morrisey said Tuesday that the state can’t continue to fund food banks long term as a solution to the delayed and partial SNAP benefits. But he may call in the state lawmakers for a special legislative session to allocate more money for food distribution. 
With so many unknowns, Claudia McKay said the Ohio County Family Resource Network is continuing to meet as many needs as they can. They’re getting calls every day for food needs.
“We have not let up,” McKay said. “We’re getting the highly increased volume and calls for food, but we’re working on providing gift cards to families just trying to meet the gap.”
“At the heart of the community, you have these organizations with these volunteers, and we’re able to mobilize quickly, meet people where they are. That said, it is such a stressor for communities, for our parents, but also for our organizations, both financially, emotionally, and physically. This has far reaching impacts on all of us,” she said.

The federal shutdown spurred by political gridlock in Washington D.C. has halted federal food stamp benefits. The effects have been felt immediately in Lafayette and across South Louisiana.
Roishetta Ozane, founder of Vessel Project of Louisiana, a mutual aid and environmental justice organization in Lake Charles, says people have been lining up since Monday morning for a food giveaway scheduled to start at 5 p.m. at her office, just around the corner from the local neighborhood Walmart.
“I’m sad because I’m anticipating that we won’t have enough for the amount of people who will come out for assistance,” Ozane said via text. “I really wish I could do more.”
In Acadiana, Second Harvest Food Bank is also gearing up for a potentially challenging time ahead.
With 23.6% of residents receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, the Lafayette region (which includes Acadia, Evangeline, Iberia, Lafayette, St. Landry, St. Martin, St. Mary and Vermilion parishes), has the highest food stamp utilization rate in the state, a percentage that has only increased in recent years.

“We deal with this every day. The difference is it’s more people,” says Paul Scelfo, chief regional officer for Second Harvest Food Bank of Greater New Orleans and Acadiana.
With the disruption in benefits leading into the holiday season, some families have to make tough choices, like a mother who reached out to Second Harvest after dipping into her Christmas savings to put food on the table for her family.
“She said it wasn’t going to be much for Christmas. But now she’s having to use what little she had for food,” Scelfo recounts.
Meanwhile, Republican Congressman Clay Higgins, whose district includes Lafayette and Lake Charles, said on social media that SNAP recipients should have at least a month’s worth of food saved up, “should never again receive SNAP” if they didn’t and should “stop smoking crack.”

There are 22 million American households receiving SNAP benefits for groceries, at $4200 per year on average.

The average SNAP household received a monthly benefit of $332. That’s $177 per person based on the average SNAP household size of 1.9 people, according to the USDA’s report for the 2023 fiscal year, the latest data available.
That year, four in five (79%) SNAP households included either a child, an elderly person or a non-elderly person with a disability. Most SNAP households live in poverty, with 73% having a household income at or below the federal poverty level, which is $15,650 per year for an individual and $32,150 for a household of four.
The standard pay for members of Congress is $174,000, in addition to housing and travel reimbursements.
Gov. Jeff Landry announced that Louisiana would use state funds to temporarily bridge the gap left by the disruption of benefits, by way of an emergency declaration redirecting $147 million from the state’s health department to cover the cost of providing food assistance to the elderly, disabled and children from qualifying families. According to figures listed in Landry’s declaration, the total number of residents in those categories is roughly 574,000.
This leaves out approximately 219,000 recipients, according to the data cited in the declaration, more than the populations of Lafayette and Lake Charles combined.
“My Administration has created over 70,000 new job opportunities in Louisiana since I took office,” Landry said in his announcement of the emergency declaration on Oct. 24. “Wages are on the rise, and our economic outlook has never looked better. This is how we move people from dependence to independence.”

The average weekly wage in Louisiana increased by 2.8% between the first quarter of 2024 and 2025, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, an increase swallowed up by an annual inflation rate of 3%. The average weekly income in the state currently stands at $1,227 before tax.
Whether the allocated funds will be enough to cover even those most in need is unclear, says Second Harvest spokesperson Natasha Curley, as is the food bank’s ability to help everyone in need.
Food banks like Second Harvest had already been struggling prior to the federal shutdown because of massive cuts to food deliveries by the United States Department of Agriculture.
“Even before the disruption to snap, we were experiencing food shortages due to other federal policy changes,” says Second Harvest spokesperson Natasha Curley. “We were already stretched thin.”
During normal times, the food bank serves an average of 431,000 people across South Louisiana, from the Texas state line to the Mississippi border. Now, Curley adds, the food bank and the pantries it supplies expect there be a higher demand on already thinned shelves.

We must strengthen our clinical workforce through a robust medical education system, writes guest columnist Joey Florence. (Getty Images) As a proud fourth-generation Idahoan and practicing family physician, I am deeply invested in the health and well-being of all Idahoans. We currently rank 50th in physicians per capita, a burden felt most heavily by our rural communities. We must strengthen our clinical workforce through a robust medical education system. 
My name is Dr. Joey Florence, a graduate of the Idaho WWAMI program and a medical student preceptor (a physician who trains students). Now, more than ever, Idaho needs to invest in its future physicians to ensure every Idahoan has access to quality care.
Physicians outline challenges, potential options to expand medical training in Idaho 

The Idaho WWAMI program — a groundbreaking partnership between the state of Idaho, the University of Idaho, and the University of Washington School of Medicine — has been a lifeline for our state’s health care system for over 53 years. It provides Idaho with a dedicated pipeline of skilled physicians, offering 40 Idaho students each year a seat at the University of Washington’s nationally renowned medical school. Similar programs in Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Washington give our students diverse training experiences in both rural and urban settings, preparing them to serve where they are needed most.
Idaho WWAMI’s track record speaks for itself. Graduates choose to practice medicine in Idaho. Idaho WWAMI has produced nearly 800 physicians. Over half of those have chosen to return to Idaho, and 72% percent of all WWAMI grads have come to Idaho to practice. With 260 clinical rotation slots across 42 sites statewide and a network of over 600 committed faculty, the program effectively bridges the gap between medical education and community health needs. Its focus on primary care and rural health — hallmarks of the University of Washington’s mission — directly align with Idaho’s health care priorities. As a public program, Idaho WWAMI’s core purpose is to serve Idahoans first, ensuring our state’s health workforce remains sustainable and local.
Idaho may tap rural hospital fund in ‘Big Beautiful’ law to grow medical education 

Following the 2025 legislative session, the Idaho State Board of Education is convening a Medical Education Workgroup to shape Idaho’s medical training future. This initiative must recognize Idaho WWAMI as the model upon which future efforts are built. We should expand and strengthen this proven program, ensuring that Idaho’s unique training needs are met while preserving the excellent education that Idaho WWAMI provides. 
Now is the time to act. Emerging Rural Health Transformation Program federal grant dollars will be disbursed to Idaho soon. Our state should prioritize funding policies that support an expansion of our medical education opportunities. By leveraging all available resources, including RHTP dollars, we can fully fund and grow medical education in Idaho by developing innovative incentives — including grants, loan repayment programs, and targeted scholarships — to attract and retain medical students, residents, and preceptors committed to serving Idaho’s communities. Investing in these pathways is an investment in Idaho’s health — one that guarantees our rural populations will have access to the exceptionally well-trained healthcare they deserve.
Let us unite behind a shared vision: a healthier Idaho, supported by a strong, dedicated clinical workforce. It’s within our reach. Let’s prioritize our medical education system today. The health care of our rural communities depends on it.

During the last decade, plans were made to retire two coal-burning units in Colorado, one in Pueblo and the other in Craig, by the end of 2025.
Now, those retirements are in doubt. It’s possible — some think likely — that in December the federal government will order utilities to continue operating the two coal units in 2026.
Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, the electrical provider for 15 cooperatives in Colorado, operates Craig 1. In an interview on Oct. 7, Duane Highley, the chief executive, said he had a “high degree of confidence, based on what I’m hearing from them today, that unless something changes, we are going to get an order to keep Craig 1 open past the end of the year.”
Highley had just returned from Washington, D.C., and meetings with officials from both the Department of Energy and the Energy Dominance Council.
On Oct. 29, Highley affirmed the same information. “I just talked with the White House this morning, and it’s still progressing.”

Xcel Energy owns and operates Comanche 2. In late August, Pueblo County announced it was seeking federal intervention to keep it operating. On Oct. 31, U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, whose congressional district encompasses both Craig and Pueblo, sent a letter to the Department of Energy asking it to order the plant to remain open beyond December. The letter also asks the DOE to order Xcel to operate Comanche 3 at full capacity until sufficient replacement generation is online.
Unlike Pueblo County’s request, which was couched as “just transition,” Hurd’s request was premised in the argument that the unit is needed for reliability.
Salient in Hurd’s letter was this statement: Xcel has “warned in formal filings that the state’s current resource plan does not meet industry standard reliability metrics.”
On Oct. 24, in brief remarks in Pueblo, Hurd had signaled that would be his argument.
“We’re facing a real reliability crisis here in Colorado,” he said.
He went on to say he hoped that Gov. Jared Polis and his administration would recognize that and agree to extend the life of Comanche 2 in light of the unexpected downtime for Comanche 3 in coming months.
“We have a reliability crisis, not only because the demand is going up, but also because unit 3 is down,” he said.
Does a reliability crisis truly exist in Colorado? If so, what caused it? And is federal intervention justified? In other words, has Colorado’s regulation of Xcel fallen short in some fundamental way, as Hurd’s letter and remarks suggest. Or instead, might this be a manufactured crisis, a ploy in the high-stakes poker game between regulators and the regulated?
 Trump uses seldom-invoked law

The Trump administration clearly wants to keep coal plants operating. In September, for example, the Department of Energy announced $625 million to “expand and reinvigorate America’s coal industry.”
Part of that mission has been to delay retirement of coal plants or, in some cases, reopen them. This law may will be most pertinent to Colorado.
In late May, the Department of Energy cited a seldom-used provision in the Federal Power Act called 202(c) in ordering the 1,420-megawatt J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan to remain open a week before its scheduled closing. A week later, it cited the same law in ordering an oil-and-gas electrical plant near Philadelphia to continue operations. The plant was one day from closing.
The 1935 law, according to the Georgetown University Law Center, permits the use of emergency authority for only 90 days in the event of war, because of a sudden increase in the demand for electricity, or because of a shortage of electricity. The Department of Energy cited energy shortages as justification for use of 202(c) powers in Michigan and Pennsylvania.
The Georgetown center said such 202(c) orders had not previously been used by the federal government in violation of what the regional grid operator wanted. Colorado has no true grid operator, although Xcel Energy is one of two balancing authorities, The Western Area Power Administration is the other.
E&E News by Politico reported in a Sept. 25 story that the Trump administration was also considering use of a different law, the Defense Production Act, to justify continued operation of mostly uneconomical coal power plants operating across the country.
The same publication on Oct. 28 reported that the DOE had solicited outside legal expertise in “statutory interpretation, regulatory analysis, and challenges to agency actions under the Federal Power Act.” The budget for this outside legal help could run to $50 million.
In Pueblo on Oct. 24, at an Action Colorado conference, Hurd reported talking with Xcel Energy folks at the Comanche plant earlier that morning. They told him that demand that had been growing about 0.5% a year now has been projected to rise between 3% and 7%. That stress, said Hurd, a former attorney for Delta-Montrose Electric and other electrical cooperatives, was making “reliable energy a top issue.”

On Oct. 31, after Hurd announced his request, the Colorado Energy Office issued this biting response: “The Trump administration already illegally ripped away $600 million dollars for clean energy jobs-creating projects across the state. … It’s important to point out that wind and solar are cheaper for consumers than expensive and often unreliable coal-fired generation, and utility resource planning is subject to state — not federal — jurisdiction.”
That mirrored the statement from Polis provided to Big Pivots in mid-October:
“The Trump Administration wants to drag us backwards into an overreliance on a non-renewable resource creating a larger economic burden on the state and consumers. Orders like these would hurt Colorado ratepayers, and harm rural communities across the West who could be forced to absorb the unnecessary excess costs required to keep these unreliable plants operational.”
Looming in the background is the alliance of President Donald Trump with fossil fuel interests. In 2016, campaigning in Grand Junction, he vowed to bring coal back. He failed. Instead, prices of renewable energy plummeted and utilities readied plans to close coal plants.
In May 2024, according to the Washington Post, Trump told oil, gas and other fossil fuel executives that if they delivered $1 billion to his campaign, he’d help them out. All available evidence indicates he got less than asked but still substantial amounts, primarily from oil and gas.
 Who decides what is needed?

The National Energy Dominance Council — one of the agencies visited by Highley on his trip to Washington — was created by Trump in February. In a story published in August, Politico said the new agency’s mission is to make the United States “energy dominant” by providing affordable, reliable energy to Americans while still generating enough electricity to power the boom in artificial intelligence.
Chris Wright, a Coloradan, is secretary of Energy and deputy director of the Energy Dominance Council. He was formerly the CEO of Liberty Energy, an oil and gas production services company based in Denver.
Highley said that Tri-State itself has excess generating capacity and does not need to continue operations of the coal-burning unit at Craig to ensure reliability. Supplies in the Western Interconnection Grid, of which Colorado is a part, have been tightening.
Sharing of electricity, however, remains hampered by lack of adequate transmission and organized markets. This is widely recognized in Colorado and beyond. The Western Governors Association held a conference in Denver just days before Hurd’s letter devoted to transmission.
Keeping the coal unit in Craig operating beyond its scheduled retirement will pose logistical challenges. The order under the 202(c) provision cannot be delivered until late this year, shortly before retirement. Further, the law allows orders for only 90 days, although they can be renewed.
Tri-State would have to procure the coal for the plant and have the workers in place to operate the plant. It has already announced plans to close the ColoWyo Mine, located about 20 miles south of Craig, late this year. However, Trapper Mine continues operations near the Craig plant as does Peabody’s Twenty Mile Mine between Hayden and Oak Creek.
Cost may be a greater issue. In January 2020, Highley announced Tri-State’s plans to get out of coal in Colorado. The reason, aside from state mandates, was cost. Coal has become the expensive fuel.
“How do we keep a coal plant operating for reliability of the overall Western Grid? Tri-State does not need it for our needs,” said Highley. “We have surplus capacity. But overall the Western grid does have some concerns about resource adequacy. So how do we keep a unit open that maybe isn’t in our financial interest but that the government says is in the national interest?”
“I’ve been asking, ‘Who’s going to pay for running this unit if we get an order that says it has to keep running,’” added Highley. “So far, no one has pulled out their checkbook. I hate for this burden to be placed on rural America. You know, our members, including farmers and ranchers, many are struggling to pay their bills today.”

Xcel Energy has been consistently restrained in its comments. It points to retirements approved by Colorado regulators: Comanche 2 in 2025, Hayden 2 in 2027, and Hayden 1 in 2028, followed by the retirement of Comanche 3 by the end of 2030. It is also replacing coal with gas at Pawnee.
In a brief interview on Oct. 29, Robert Kenney, the president of Xcel’s Denver-based division, Public Service Co. of Colorado, added a little more depth.
“We’ve been preparing to retire that plant (Comanche 2) by the end of the year since 2018, and so we’ll have to make sure that it is prepared to be able to run beyond the end of the year,” he said. “That’s going to obviously require some maintenance and some upkeep. If we get an order telling us to do that, we’ll have to examine the actual language of the order, understand what it requires of us. But we’ll comply with the law.”
Xcel also issued a statement on Oct. 31: “We are in regular conversations about Colorado’s energy future with various stakeholders, including federal, state and local elected officials. We are aware that there are members of the community that would like to see the plant’s life extended. ”
In ordering that fossil fuel plants remain open, the Trump administration assumes their value in providing baseload generation. In practice, no plants — coal, gas, and nuclear — operate without downtime for maintenance.
Unexpected outages can occur. Few coal plants have been as trouble-plagued as Xcel’s 750-megawatt Comanche 3. It was offline about 90 days each year during its first decade of operations, which began in 2010. Beginning in 2020, the unit was down for more than a year. Outages have been frequent since then.
In August, the unit went down again. This time, it’s not expected to resume operations until June 2026.
Comanche 2 — the unit scheduled for retirement in December — has had no comparable problems. It went online in 1975. Craig 1 has also had relatively few problems since operations began in 1980. They’re not 100%, but neither have they been lemons.
 Plans laid in past decade

Retirements of both Comanche 2 and Craig 1 have been planned for years. In the case of Craig 1, Tri-State and its co-owners — Fort Collins-based Platte River Power Authority, Xcel Energy and also Salt River Project and PacifiCorp — were sued because of the contributions of the coal-burning units at Craig and Nucla to pollution that impaired air quality in the Mount Zirkel and other designated wilderness areas and national parks on the Western Slope. This deteriorated air quality violated the regional haze standards set by the EPA.
Tri-State and its co-owners could have installed equipment limiting emissions of nitrous oxide by 2021. Instead, they agree to close Craig 1 by 2025. Costs of wind, especially, but also solar were then plummeting, making continued operations of coal less attractive.
Comanche 2’s closing was planned in 2018. The order by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission said Xcel would close the 335-megawatt unit “no later than the end of 2025.”
That PUC decision had been preceded by a response to Xcel’s request for bids that in December 2017 had caused slackened jaws — not just in Colorado, but across the nation. The PUC decision noted that Xcel’s solicitation had “garnered an exceptional number of diverse and low-cost bids.” This, the PUC commissioners said, “provides a rare opportunity to capture some of the lowest resource bids ever experienced in Colorado.”










The Trump Administration wants to drag us backwards into an overreliance on a non-renewable resource creating a larger economic burden on the state and consumers.


– Colorado Gov. Jared Polis


Of note were the low cost of wind but also, for the first time in Colorado, utility-scale battery storage. The approved plan called for Xcel to purchase two existing gas plants.
Among the signatories to that PUC decision was then-Commissioner France Koncilja, now Pueblo County’s attorney in Comanche matters.
The PUC decision was issued in August 2018, several months before the election of Polis, who had run for governor on a platform of renewable energy. He had launched his campaign in Pueblo at the Solar Roast Coffee.
A month after the election of Polis, Xcel Energy summoned many to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science for a major announcement: It believed it could achieve an 80% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030 (compared to 2005 levels) and 100% by 2050 in the eight states in which it operated.
Polis spoke, too. “Elections have consequences,” he said.
Xcel’s goals were enshrined in state legislation in May 2019.
The 2021 electric resource plan filed by Xcel Energy continued this planning. By October 2024, when Xcel filed its latest resource plan with the PUC, it noted an “inflection point” in its energy transition from coal.
From an average annual growth in demand of 0.7% during the previous five years, it was projecting a compounded annual demand growth of 4% from 2023 through 2031 in its base case. Even in a low-growth scenario, demand would grow 2.8% annually,
Meeting this demand, explained Xcel’s Jack Ihle, an Xcel vice president, would require Xcel’s generating capacity to expand from its existing 7 gigawatts to somewhere between 7.6 GW and 9.6GW by the end of 2031. Keep in mind Comanche 3’s capacity: three-quarters of one gigawatt.
The document mentioned “resource adequacy” more than a dozen times.
 Resource adequacy

Worries about “resource adequacy” have mounted during the last two years. The Seattle Times reported on Oct. 21 of growth in electricity demand of 0.9% three years ago in the Pacific Northwest to now 3.2% per year. Energy + Environmental Economics, a consultant, found the most probable occurrence for a blackout would be a days-long cold snap during a year of relatively little hydropower production. That, however, was unlikely in the next five years.
Colorado has had no blackouts due to inadequate resources. Xcel, however, issued an orange alert on Aug. 7, warning its 1.5 million electrical customers in Colorado of a remote possibility for outages. A PUC staff member who analyzed the causes reported several problems, including less solar production than had been expected. That report also found that Xcel had 11 fossil fuel plants that had some amounts of unplanned outages. Of those, 80% were among coal plants.
Proponents of fossil fuel generation insist that coal plants will be needed for baseload generation. Undeniably it’s more reliable than solar power. Except, as in the case of Comanche 3, when it is missing in action for a year at a time. But all forms of generation — coal, natural gas and nuclear, too — have down time.
Do we have enough reserve margins in the grid? Trump in April directed the Department of Energy to analyze current and reserve margins of the nation’s three electrical grids. In issuing the report in July, the press release issued by the DOE said the analysis had revealed that retirement of fossil fuel plants and delays in adding new “firm capacity, driven by the radical green agenda of past administrations,” would lead to a surge in power outages and a growing discrepancy between electricity demand and supply. It cited growth in demand from data centers as a major cause of demand growth.
Green-leaning groups were skeptical. In a July appraisal, Ric OConnell, an analyst from GridLab, called the DOE report “problematic” because of questionable assumptions. Advanced Energy United, in August, said the DOE analysis was “rather a protocol for pursuing a preferred solution to addressing resource adequacy needs.”
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser joined eight other states in asking for a rehearing. Their motion mentioned retirement of both Craig and Pueblo this year.
“These retirements have been thoroughly vetted by state and regional authorities and approved only following an extensive examination of cost considerations and reliability impacts,” the motion said.
Xcel has been sounding an increasingly loud alarm about resource adequacy. A Feb. 11 letter from three senior officers at Xcel Energy’s Minneapolis headquarters warned that Colorado’s “resource planning process is proving too inflexible to meet needs in a dynamic environment.”
Xcel no longer met industry standard reliability metrics nor the reliability assumptions used in the planning process several years before, the letter warned. Even addition of a third gas-burning plant left Xcel in a “suboptimal position.”
Citing the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, Xcel reported that 76% of proposed resource additions from 2018 through 2022 had come online. In 2023, that figure fell to 53%. The rest were delayed or cancelled.
“The state of play is not only about load growth; generation retirements are outpacing new resources coming onto the grid. New resources are being delayed due to various factors and will aggravate the situation in the coming years. Demand is increasing, across the West.”
A different conclusion was drawn by the Colorado Energy Office in a report issued July 1. 
Colorado utilities, the report said, have “adequate capacity to meet customer electricity needs.” That was an overall summary, though. Xcel’s component of that report mentioned that the utility expected to have a capacity shortfall of 88 megawatts in 2026, growing to 1,000 megawatts shortfall in 2030.
Two former PUC commissioners have also weighed in to support delayed retirements of coal plants. There are the comments and filings of Koncilja, a commissioner from 2016 to 2020, on behalf of the economic needs of Pueblo County. The county, with the notable exception of its steel plant, gets electricity from a utility other than Tri-State.
John Gavan, a commissioner from 2018 to 2022, has been more broadly raising concerns about resource adequacy. He cites the projected demands of data centers but also notes that some electric providers in Colorado are unregulated by the state in their resource planning, unlike Xcel and Tri-State.
The PUC regulates Xcel, Black Hills, and Tri-State but not municipal providers and other cooperatives, among them United Power, CORE Electrical Cooperative, and Holy Cross Energy.
Whatever concerns there were before, the Xcel’s report to the PUC in early October added urgency.
 Environmental community 

The environmental community in Colorado says the Trump administration has weak justification in using the 202(c) clause in the Federal Power Act. They point out that Colorado’s PUC has a rigorous process for ensuring that utilities have sufficient reserve margins. Xcel itself, in its October 2024 filing, noted Colorado’s “gold standard” for resource planning — although that was said while asserting the need to create a “new gold standard.
Groups also point out that peak demand in Colorado typically comes in summer, not winter, when the orders for the units at Craig and Pueblo may be issued.
“202(c) isn’t intended to be used for long-term resource planning,” said Matthew Gerhart, senior attorney for the Sierra Club at its Denver office. “It’s intended for use in war-time or similarly brief, sudden emergencies like natural disasters. Even if it were true that there are resource adequacy issues, 202(c) isn’t the proper vehicle for addressing those issues.”
For that matter, he said, electricity cannot be put on trucks like bananas or iPhones and shipped anywhere in the country. In electricity, Colorado remains much like an island, with limited transmission to other utilities in the West. Market mechanisms for electricity sharing are just now getting short, stubby legs — although that will change dramatically in the next five years.
“So, even if there were an electricity shortage in, say Washington or Idaho or California, that doesn’t mean that keeping Craig 1 online will help, given the lack of a West-wide electricity market and the transmission limitations and congestions,” Gerhart said.
Sarah Keane, an attorney with Kaplan Kirsch who represents Colorado Communities for Climate Action and others, pointed out that the need is more than bulk power. Technologies that have flexible ramping, including natural gas, can better respond to peak demands than can coal.
Erin Overturf, clean energy director for Western Resource Advocates, said if the grid faces an actual emergency, the Trump administration would be using every tool it had. Instead, it has been doing everything it can to stop renewable energy development. She calls it a “manufactured emergency.”
And, in the case of Craig 1, there is that sticky matter of complying with the federal laws limiting regional haze.
In Arizona, cost was the fulcrum for this issue, not environmental needs.
The Arizona Corporation Commission, that state’s equivalent of the Colorado PUC, pushed back at calls by Republican state legislators to the federal government to bring mothballed coal plants in Arizona out of retirement.
Kevin Thompson, the chair of the commission, said in a May 30 posting that bringing the recently closed Cholla plant in northern Arizona into compliance with federal environmental standards would cost a “staggering $1.9 billion — a cost to be borne by ratepayers of its owner, Arizona Public Service.”
In Arizona, the commission members are elected, not appointed by the governor, as is the case in Colorado. Thompson campaigned with the boast that he had “stopped the Green New Deal.”
“Managing highly intricate systems like our electrical grid is far more complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker,” Thompson said.

(Rendering by EAPC and AP Construction courtesy of Native American Development Center and Native Inc. )At 25, Lorraine Davis’ battle with substance abuse landed her in prison, but she wasn’t a felon. 
She was a grieving daughter who turned to substances to mourn the death of her mother, and neither her community nor the state had the resources to support her. When the local treatment center didn’t have room, a judge sent her behind bars.
Davis said her story is all too common for Indigenous North Dakotans, and is what’s motivating her to establish a first-of-its-kind cultural center in Bismarck — a centrally-located place where families, tourists and everyone in between can build community while learning more about traditional Indigenous healing.

“I want to bring back our way of life and healing to Indigenous populations,” she said.
Davis leads the two organizations behind the effort: the Native American Development Center and Native Inc.
“It’s all a part of our healing; it’s prevention for the young people, it’s recovery, and even intervention through traditional healing approaches, even if it’s just by attending arts and crafts programs, or language programs, or ceremonies,” she said. 
Early planning documents include a wide variety of amenities to be housed at the facility: a gym, an auditorium, a sweat lodge, healing center, cafeteria, community kitchen, library, computer lab, several business storefronts, classrooms and art galleries. 
The cultural center, estimated to cost between $27 million and $35 million, would sit on 11 acres, with three acres dedicated to affordable housing. Housing construction is not included in the cost, according to Davis. The exact location has not been disclosed because the nonprofits are in the process of buying the land.
The development center will focus on the business and commerce-related spaces and Native Inc. will develop areas tied to social services, cultural programming and events. 
The facilities will be open for public use, but Davis said the point of the project is to reconnect Indigenous people to their traditions. 
She listed a swath of services to be offered at the center, from after-school child care to workforce development. 
“The jobs the state struggles to fill, we need to get Native Americans into those jobs. This is one way to do that,” Davis said. 
Organizers are working with agencies like the Greater North Dakota Chamber and Native Tourism Alliance to ensure no efforts are being duplicated, Davis said. 
To fund the project, she is turning to tribes from across the country as well as banks, oil companies, various foundations, the state Legislature and even the federal government. 
She said “it’s going to take everything,” adding that in the state with a significant number of residents quietly carrying wealth, “there’s not enough philanthropy.”
Chair of the State and Tribal Relations Committee Rep. Dawson Holle, R-Mandan, vowed to help Davis find some sort of state support for the projects. Davis is a constituent of Holle’s. 
He said he was “blown away” when Davis first showed him the facility’s design.
“It’s an awesome thing,” Holle said. “Many people don’t really know about Native culture or Native communities; so, it could definitely be an educational tool. It would benefit not only the tribal communities, but also area residents.”
The project will be a “worthy discussion” during the next legislative session, Holle said, especially considering the positive track record Davis and her organizations have in North Dakota. His fellow committee members were on board with the proposal, he added. 
The five tribes that share geography with North Dakota are behind the project as well, according to Davis.
Holle said he supports the state aiding in the cost somehow — whether it be through a direct grant, matching state funds with money fundraised or with a line of credit from the state-owned Bank of North Dakota, which, for instance, is what the state used to help pay for the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library.
Davis has already secured facility designs for free from EAPC, an architecture and engineering firm with offices in Bismarck. The goal is to have the project completed in the next five years, she said. 
Though it’s in its early stages, Holle and Davis said they are hopeful the project will continue its momentum and find the funding necessary to move forward. 
“It will be a space where Native Americans are helping Native Americans — and or everybody else,” Davis said. “It’s just a different way of what we’re used to seeing, which is the standard approach of faith-based organizations or charities. It’s connected directly to the tribes.”

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Colorado continues making headlines for having some of the worst pollution in the entire country. Fourteen counties, including Denver, Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Jefferson, Weld and Larimer, received failing grades for ozone pollution in 2025, while Denver and Boulder also failed for particle pollution, making the Denver–Aurora–Greeley metro the sixth most polluted region in the United States.
The impacts are more severe for communities near Denver’s Suncor refinery, major interstates and highways, and other fossil fuel infrastructure. Latino, Black and low-income residents breathe the dirtiest air in the state, with higher cases of asthma, cardiovascular disease and cancer. The health of families are sacrificed by an economy that is dependent on fossil fuel burning. In fact, our communities are often only able to live in housing with poor energy efficiency and poor ventilation, and they must use extremely expensive gas to heat their homes when more affordable alternatives are available.
Luckily, the state has laws on the books aimed at reducing this pollution and increasing affordability. But these laws will only work if state officials, utilities and regulators agree to doing what’s best for our communities, putting our needs over utility profits.

Colorado made history in 2021 when it passed the nation’s first Clean Heat law requiring gas utilities like Xcel Energy to cut emissions 4% by 2025 and 22% by 2030 compared to 2015 levels. This law was designed only to address air and climate pollution while making heating more affordable by helping transition buildings to use more efficient equipment and reduce gas pollution.
Now, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission is deciding the next target for 2035 and beyond, and the outcome will determine whether Coloradans see lower bills and healthier homes or utilities lock families into volatile fossil fuels and outdated, polluting systems.
Utilities like Xcel are fighting to weaken the law. They have asked the PUC to freeze ambition at just 30% reductions by 2035, a move that would block the transition to more efficient electric heating that lowers bills.
But it’s not just utilities pushing back. The administration of Gov. Jared Polis recently caved, lowering its own proposal from 41% to 31%, nearly identical to what Xcel requested. Weak targets not only keep families paying more, they also prolong pollution that makes it harder for those living near highways, refineries and industrial sites to breathe, driving higher rates of asthma and heart disease. It’s outrageous that Polis would side with a company that reported $1.94 billion in profits in 2024, with $1.2 billion paid out to shareholders, even as Colorado families struggled with rising energy bills.
The good news is that the solutions exist. Beneficial electrification, which replaces gas with efficient electric appliances like heat pumps, is a proven and cost-effective way to cut pollution, protect health and save families money. Unlike so-called “recovered methane” which utilities want to rely on as a loophole, electrification avoids locking us into costly new gas infrastructure and delivers real, lasting reductions.
That is why advocates, local governments and community leaders are calling for the PUC to adopt at least a 55% cut by 2035, set clear targets through 2050, and maintain the 5% cap on recovered methane. Over 600 Coloradans, 12 current and former state legislators, and 25 organizations, including environmental justice organizations, have already submitted comments in support.
The PUC must now decide whether to stand with Colorado families or corporate shareholders. Adopting strong Clean Heat rules that deliver a 55% reduction by 2035, establish future targets through 2050 and limit false solutions, would cut pollution, lower bills and protect the health of the most vulnerable. Colorado can either lead the nation in building decarbonization or allow utilities to lock families into another generation of high bills and pollution.
The choice is clear: protect people, protect the climate and finalize strong Clean Heat rules.

(Photo by Jonathan Shorman/Stateline)KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Before Abhinav Kochar traveled from India to the United States to study computer science in late 2023, a consular official interviewed him at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi. It’s in a scene repeated countless times around the world each year as foreign students seek access to American higher education.
The high-stakes meeting lasted less than five minutes. Kochar, who’s fascinated by machine learning and artificial intelligence, discussed why he wanted to study in the United States. He was granted a student visa, but said a friend of his was twice rejected.
“The interview process in front of me was pretty brutal,” said Kochar, now a 23-year-old who expects to graduate from the University of Missouri-Kansas City in December with a master’s degree in computer science.
Now, coming to the United States to study has become more difficult. President Donald Trump is back in office and taking a harder line on international students, arguing that they are taking university spots or jobs from American students, though some research shows international students help subsidize domestic students. The Trump administration has also cited security concerns for its more restrictive approach.
The ongoing changes hold major implications across U.S. higher education, including taxpayer-funded public colleges and universities. Some state universities enroll large numbers of international students, who often pay full tuition, boosting schools’ bottom lines. These flagship institutions have long been the envy of the world, attracting generations of foreign students and helping to shape attitudes toward the United States abroad.
State universities admit more out-of-state students for the tuition bump

Stateline asked for international enrollment data from every public university in the Big 12 Conference — 13 schools spread across the country, many with major research programs likely to attract international students. Six provided some level of information or directed Stateline to publicly available data.
Four of the six schools — Arizona State University, the University of Arizona, Kansas State University, the University of Kansas — reported a decline in international students. The other schools, the University of Utah and West Virginia University, experienced increases in overall international enrollment.
What attracts many international students are the temporary jobs they might get in the United States after graduation. While American degrees can be prestigious, employment experience is what sometimes truly gives them an edge when they return home.
But a Trump administration official has floated eliminating a policy that allows recent foreign graduates to work in the United States. Optional Practical Training, or OPT, allows graduates to stay for a year. Some students in science, engineering and related fields can stay for up to three years.
The Department of Homeland Security has also proposed a rule that would place a default four-year limit on international students’ time in the United States. The plan poses a major obstacle for Ph.D. students, whose studies can sometimes stretch half a decade or more. Currently, students can generally remain as long as they progress toward their degree, a policy known as duration of status.
The Trump administration has also approached some universities with a proposed compact that reportedly calls on schools to limit the percentage of their student population from outside the United States. The compact could serve as a model for other schools across the country.
And the State Department is now applying greater scrutiny to prospective students’ social media, after pausing student visa interviews for several weeks in late spring.
“We need to think about the fact that this is the first year of the Trump administration. This is the first year we are seeing these changes, and we know that there are more changes coming up,” said Zuzana Wootson, deputy director of federal policy at the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, a group that advocates on behalf of hundreds of college presidents and chancellors.

Most Americans support U.S. colleges and universities accepting international students, according to a September survey by the Pew Research Center. Ninety-three percent of Democrats or Democratic-leaning respondents and 66% of Republicans and Republican-leaning respondents said it’s good for schools to take international students.
But half of all respondents indicated support for limiting the number of Chinese students, and about 40% supported limits on students from India, Nigeria and South Korea.
A sizable minority of Americans also overestimate how many international students are in the country. In the survey, 43% of respondents said international students make up 10% or more of all college students in the United States; in reality, international students account for about 6% of all U.S. college students, though the percentage has grown over time, and especially over the past two decades.
Kochar isn’t yet sure what, if anything, the changes could mean for him. He wants to pursue a doctorate degree at the University of Missouri-Kansas City after graduating, though the funding for the position is not yet guaranteed. So he’s begun looking into Optional Practice Training — the work policy for recent foreign graduates that Trump may eliminate.
“I feel like there’s a lot of stuff that is said but not done, in a way. So there is this thing in the back of my head which makes me worry, but then again, nothing is happening in front of me,” Kochar said.
Work experience valued
Many international students say the potential for work experience is crucial to their decision to study in the United States.
Juan Pereira, a 21-year-old finance and economics major at Kansas State University, said having American work experience would be very valuable in his home country of Paraguay. “Regarding experience and all, it would be very, very attractive, I’m sure, for a lot of people who are looking for new hires,” he said.
Amid uncertainty over the United States’ stance toward international students, some data suggests a nationwide drop in enrollment. But the scale and extent of any decline remain unclear.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported 10,370 fewer foreign students in the United States in October 2025 compared with October 2024, a decrease of less than 1%. That’s far less than a possible 15% enrollment decline projected by NAFSA earlier in the year. But inaccuracies have previously been found in the Homeland Security data, which covers all foreign students, including those in high school and other noncollege programs.
Separately, monthly data published by the U.S. International Trade Administration indicates fewer people holding student visas entered the United States ahead of the fall semester. In August 2025, student visa arrivals were 19.1% lower than in August 2024 (the data doesn’t include entries from Canada or Mexico via land). The decline was most pronounced among African countries, with student visa entries from the continent collectively down 32.5%.
Experts in international enrollment cautioned that while the decrease may suggest a decline, it could also indicate many current students decided not to travel home this summer, potentially because they feared their ability to reenter the United States.
Asmita Mahara, a 27-year-old from Nepal who’s a first-year Ph.D. student in biological and agricultural engineering at Kansas State University, said she called off a visit home this summer because of what she called the “ongoing situation right now.” She also opted against traveling to a conference in Canada related to her field.
The summer would have been an ideal time to go to Nepal, Mahara said. “But since I missed this opportunity, I don’t think I will be able to go there before my graduation.”
Trump’s new $100K visa fee could worsen state doctor shortages, experts say

International enrollment in the United States has risen steadily from 1% of all students during the 1949-1950 academic year to nearly 6% in 2023-2024, according to an analysis of enrollment data by the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based nonpartisan group that conducts immigration research. The largest growth has occurred in the past 20 years.
During the 2023-2024 academic year, Arizona State University had the fourth-largest international enrollment in higher education (and the highest among public schools), with 18,430 students, according to Open Doors, a State Department-sponsored data source. Last fall, the university dipped to 15,104 international students. This semester, the number dropped to 14,600, a 3% decline.
On its website, Arizona State attributed the decrease primarily to students’ difficulty obtaining visa appointments in time for the fall 2025 semester. It also emphasized the 3% decline wasn’t final, as students join the university throughout the year.
At Kansas State University, 26 fewer international students are enrolled than a year ago, a decrease of roughly 3%. But overall, the university has about 200 fewer international students than it did five years ago, during the fall 2020 semester at the height of the pandemic — leaving the effect of the Trump administration’s recent moves unclear.
In an email, K-State spokesperson Michelle Geering wrote that some students admitted but not yet studying at the university are experiencing challenges in scheduling visa appointments in their home countries.
At the University of Utah, overall international enrollment climbed by less than 1%, a result driven by a 9.1% increase in international undergraduate students. That helped offset a nearly equally large drop in international graduate students.
Randy McCrillis, the senior international officer at the University of Utah, said he had traveled to India in August as part of an American delegation to recruit students. “When I was there, most of the folks we were talking to were like, ‘Look, I’m just not even going to apply to the U.S.,’” McCrillis said.
Reversal from rhetoric
The Trump administration has said the changes related to international students are necessary to protect the country’s security and American job seekers, and to combat abuse of the visa process. When Homeland Security unveiled its proposal in August to end duration of status, the department said past administrations had allowed international students and other visa holders to stay virtually indefinitely.
Joseph Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, indicated during his Senate confirmation hearing that he wants the agency to have the authority to end Optional Practical Training. U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, in September called on Homeland Security to restrict work authorizations for international students.
“Competition from foreign graduates is contributing to rising unemployment rates among college-educated Americans,” Grassley wrote in a letter to Secretary Kristi Noem.
The narrowing posture from the Trump administration and its allies marks a reversal from Trump’s campaign rhetoric. Before the 2024 election, Trump said international students should “automatically” receive green cards with their diploma when they graduate.
On “The All-In Podcast” in June 2024, Trump outlined an expansive view of which students should be allowed to remain in the United States permanently. Graduates of two- and four-year colleges, along with those who earn doctorate degrees, “should be able to stay in this country,” he said.
“You have to be able to recruit these people and keep the people,” Trump said.
The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees USCIS, and the White House didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
Benefits to schools, economy
Supporters of strong international enrollment point to extensive research showing foreign students are a boon to the colleges and universities. They also fear a large, sustained drop in international students would deliver a blow to the American economy.
Researchers who studied international enrollment at public research universities between 1996 and 2012 have previously found that every 10% reduction in state funding was associated with a 12% increase in international enrollment. In other words, universities relied on international students to soften the financial blow of losing taxpayer dollars.
And in October, an academic paper estimated that a one-third drop in international students in STEM — Science, Technology, Engineering, Math — entering the U.S. workforce would cause a 6-11% drop in the overall STEM workforce.
“The idea that more STEM students in America mean fewer STEM jobs for Americans is something where we don’t need off-the-cuff takes from politicians,” said Michael Clemens, an economics professor at George Mason University who studies the effects of migration and co-authored the October paper.
Blake Flanders, president and CEO of the Kansas Board of Regents, which governs the state’s six public universities and coordinates its community colleges, said concerns he hears about international students displacing American students represent a narrative most often associated with elite higher education institutions.
“Certainly, it’s not in alignment with what we have here in Kansas with our state universities or community colleges,” Flanders said during an interview. He added a short time later that Kansas’ state universities have the capacity to take more students.
“International students are a big value-add to the educational experience for Kansans.”

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A week into a fundraising campaign to help stock shelves, South Carolina’s disaster relief fund provided nearly $233,000 to food banks amid continued uncertainty on when federal grocery assistance will resume.
One SC Fund’s first distribution Monday to the state’s four regional food banks came two days after a halt of benefits in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The amount raised so far is a fraction of normal aid provided through the program commonly called food stamps.
With the impending suspension of grocery benefits for 550,000 South Carolinians, Gov. Henry McMaster last Tuesday activated the fund, which collects donations during emergencies to supplement what the government doesn’t cover. McMaster also directed the volunteer State Guard to help unload truckloads of food and ensure safety at food pantries.
On Friday, a federal judge in Rhode Island ruled that pausing SNAP during the federal government shutdown violated the law. In his order, U.S. District Chief Judge John McConnell ordered federal officials to issue payments, which stopped Saturday as the program ran out of regular funding. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the national program, said it would pay about half of November’s benefits from a contingency fund but added the bureaucracy involved could hold up the payments for weeks or months.


Adding to the confusion, President Donald Trump posted on social media Tuesday that SNAP payments would resume “only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt seemed to walk that back by saying Trump was referring to future uses of the contingency fund, and the USDA wrote in a court filing later Tuesday that it continues planning for partial payments, States Newsroom reported.
The state Department of Social Services has not received any guidance from the USDA, said spokeswoman Connelly-Anne Ragley. State officials never touch the federal money, so it’s impossible for the agency to simply upload any amount, she said. DSS determines whether a person is eligible, and the USDA transfers the benefits to the debit cards used for purchases through a third-party vendor.
Typically, SNAP benefits go out to recipients on a staggered schedule over the course of the first 19 days of each month, according to a chart provided to the SC Daily Gazette.
By Oct. 4, 54,100 people had received their benefits, meaning a similar number of people have not yet gotten their monthly allotment of SNAP for this month. In total, close to 550,000 people across 264,000 households received SNAP benefits last month, according to DSS data.
Anyone who has money left on their cards from previous allocations can continue using it, according to DSS.
Another federal feeding benefit — the Women, Infants and Children Nutrition Program — will continue as usual, said Department of Public Health spokesman Casey White. The White House’s budget office pulled from tariff revenue to continue covering the cost of benefits for pregnant and breastfeeding women and their young children, White said in an email.
Nearly 99,000 women and children used the supplemental funding in August to buy baby food, formula and other grocery staples, according to the agency’s most recently available data.
Donations
In the past week, a record number of people donated to the One SC Fund to help make up for the lost SNAP benefits, said Georgia Mjartan, president and CEO of the Central Carolina Community Foundation, which operates the fund. As of Monday evening, 562 donors contributed a total of $232,550, she said.

The total remains far below what the state would need to cover food benefits for every household receiving SNAP benefits. Last month, the federal benefit doled out close to $105 million in South Carolina, for an average of about $400 per household (or $190 per person), according to DSS.
Officials acknowledged the fund was unlikely to come close to covering the entire gap. The most the One SC Fund has ever collected after a disaster was about $6.2 million following Tropical Storm Helene last year. Unlike that more concentrated disaster, the pause in SNAP benefits affected millions of people nationwide, meaning officials are expecting fewer of the grants and large corporate donations that typically make up most of the donations following natural disasters, Mjartan said.
“This is nowhere near what we’d hoped to be able to deliver to our food banks and food pantries,” Mjartan said.
Duke Energy made the one major donation to come in so far, she said. The utility company gave $100,000 as part of an annual initiative to make sure people have food ahead of Thanksgiving. The utility plans to donate another $500,000 to local food banks and other organizations providing food to hungry people throughout the month, according to a news release.
“These organizations are fighting the good fight every day in communities across our state, but they cannot do it alone,” said Tim Pearson, the state utility’s president, in the release. “Duke Energy is happy to stand with the governor, and we encourage other corporate entities, organizations and citizens across the state to help support the fight against hunger.”


What are other states doing?

A panel of Oklahoma lawmakers voted Monday to send $1 million each week to the state’s food banks until the end of the shutdown or for the next seven weeks, whichever comes first.
Virginia is issuing weekly payments through a newly created, state-funded program meant to replicate SNAP.
Delaware plans to spend $5 million a week on state funds to pay SNAP benefits, which the federal government said it will not reimburse.



One SC Fund distributed its first round of funding to the state’s four largest food banks Monday. The organization used a funding formula based on the number of food-insecure people each food bank typically serves, Mjartan said. Since those nonprofits cover every county in the state, funding them means the money will help people statewide more quickly than trying to fund smaller organizations, she said.
Initially, the fund planned to give some money to smaller food banks as well, but officials quickly realized the money wasn’t coming in at the same rate as the applications for help. In three days, 45 organizations submitted applications, and another 28 had started one before the fund closed the application window, Mjartan said.
Some of the applicants wanted to fill in gaps the big food banks can’t, Mjartan said. One would have delivered food to low-income people with disabilities that make them unable to leave the house or stand in long food bank lines. Another would have brought specialized food items to children with disabilities that require certain diets, she said.
“The applications that are waiting in the queue are very compelling and meeting people in the community’s very basic needs,” Mjartan said. “But we’re not able to fund them because the dollars aren’t there.”
Restaurants step up
Donating money isn’t the only way to help, state officials said during a news conference last week.
Proving that point, some restaurants are offering free meals until SNAP benefits return.
Nicky’s Pizzeria in Lexington and Luca’s Wood Fire Pizza & Restaurant in Columbia are offering free to-go meals for children whose parents show their SNAP cards and IDs, the restaurants said in Facebook posts. At Luca’s Wood Fire Pizza, customers have the option to purchase an extra meal the pizzeria will hand out to anyone who visits and tells a manager they are affected by the SNAP cutoff, according to a social media post.
Bubba’s Pub-N-Grub, also in Lexington, is donating hot dogs, chili and chips to families who typically receive SNAP and furloughed federal employees every Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m.
Elgin’s Eatery 117 will give anyone affected by the government shutdown leftover yogurt parfaits, overnight oats, muffins and other grab-and-go items on Sundays after closing, the cafe said in a Facebook post.


All six Charleston Sports Pub locations across the state are offering free meals for children. As are Coconut Joe’s Beach Grill, Lawrence’s Seafood Company and The Shelter Kitchen and Bar, according to parent company Perry Hospitality Group.
North Charleston’s Good Vibes Only 843 has free children’s meals available, and Bangin’ Vegan Eats food truck in Charleston is offering free bean burgers with a side of fries to anyone who orders the SNAP burger.
During a Monday night town hall, Rep. JA Moore collected enough nonperishable food to create meals for about 100 families, which he donated to Blessed Hands Food Pantry in Goose Creek, he said. The North Charleston Democrat, who owns a catering company, said he and other Charleston Democrats plan to continue directing nonperishable items and money to local food banks and urged people to drop off donations if they’re able.
“I’ve spent my entire career feeding people through my restaurant and my catering business, and now this is another way of doing that,” Moore said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_0387-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-05 05:16:46.766115

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin) Earlier this year, the commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services cautioned lawmakers about potential air quality challenges and federal consequences the state could face if it moved to end mandatory vehicle emissions testing without approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
Those consequences would take the form of sanctions up to the possible withholding of federal highway funding from New Hampshire, EPA Region One Administrator Mark Sanborn told the state in an April letter.
Lawmakers passed legislation ending the program anyway, approving an early 2026 sunset on emissions testing and vehicle inspections along with the biennial budget in June. 
Now, to enact that while sidestepping federal penalties, New Hampshire is preparing to file with the EPA to amend the state’s air quality protection plan and to take the historic step of becoming the first state to fully withdraw from the Ozone Transport Commission, a regional air pollution control organization. 
NHDES argues in draft versions of those applications that the state’s air quality will not worsen when emissions testing ends. But the data that case is built on, some experts said, might not paint a full picture of the ways ending the program could affect long-term air quality across the state.
Emissions concerns and testing
During a New Hampshire emissions test, a technician scans a vehicle’s computer, which is designed to track the performance of key pollution-reducing systems and flag malfunctions. This is less involved and, according to NHDES, less costly than the physical “tailpipe” testing required in some other states, where the gas released from a car’s exhaust system is analyzed for excessive pollution. 
Both varieties of emissions tests are intended to limit the release of harmful byproducts formed when fuel burns. As vehicles age and components like the exhaust-scrubbing catalytic converter begin to fail, they emit more and more of these byproducts, including compounds like nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and particulate matter. These chemicals have a wide range of harmful effects, said vehicle emissions expert Maria Cecilia Pinto de Moura, who works with the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, D.C.
In addition to contributing to acid rain formation, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds react with sunlight in the atmosphere to form ozone, a respiratory irritant that can make it harder to breathe and aggravates lung conditions like asthma and emphysema. Ozone can be dangerous even at low levels, according to the EPA; when it becomes concentrated near the ground, it is the main component of the hazy pollution often referred to as smog.
Nitrogen oxides can also be converted into particulate matter in the atmosphere, Pinto de Moura said. Particulate matter is linked to a broad range of illnesses from lung cancer and cardiovascular disease to diabetes, obesity, and neurological conditions, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
“It’s really damning,” Pinto de Moura said.
Vehicle emissions are the most significant source of human exposure to those chemicals, according to John Dunlap, former chair of the California Air Resources Board. 
“Fifty-five percent or so of human exposure to air pollution comes from cars and the burning of fuel,” he said. “That’s consequential.”
Clean Air Act says states must play a role in reducing smog
Enacted in response to nationwide concerns around air quality, acid rain, and human health, the Clean Air Act of 1963 was the first federal legislation aimed at controlling smog and other forms of air pollution. The act and subsequent amendments established air quality targets and called for states to have “State Implementation Plans” in place to continue meeting federal air quality goals.
In many states, including New Hampshire, vehicle emissions testing has been a central component of those plans. And a 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act united New Hampshire, 11 other Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, and the District of Columbia into the Ozone Transport Commission in response to interstate air quality concerns across the region. Members of the commission are required to conduct emissions testing.
Because New Hampshire has previously listed emissions testing among the programs it employs to remain in compliance with the Clean Air Act, in addition to putting New Hampshire out of compliance with requirements of Ozone Transport Commission membership, eliminating the program could put the state in violation of the Clean Air Act if the State Implementation Plan is not updated and approved by the EPA.
“If this legislation passes, New Hampshire will not meet the (Clean Air Act) requirements for (inspection and maintenance) programs,” wrote Sanborn, the EPA Region One administrator, in an April 25, 2025, letter to NHDES Commissioner Robert Scott.
To remedy this, according to NHDES, New Hampshire is taking steps to leave the Ozone Transport Commission and amend its State Implementation Plan. That includes describing how the state will continue to meet air quality targets even without emissions tests.
“With legislation eliminating a part, an important part, of the state implementation plan, the state has to demonstrate to EPA that it can and will comply with the Clean Air Act without the program,” said Tom Irwin, vice president of the Conservation Law Foundation’s New Hampshire chapter.
Projections and doubts
In a draft version of the amended implementation plan, NHDES cites air quality monitoring data that shows New Hampshire with lower-than-required levels of several emissions-related pollutants in recent years.
This is consistent with overall trends, which show pollution on the decline in New Hampshire as a whole, said NHDES spokesperson Jim Martin in an email on Nov. 3. “Current emission levels in New Hampshire are well below the levels that NH was experiencing when the state first came into attainment with National Ambient Air Quality Standards,” he wrote.
The proposed revision also cites a projection of air quality measurements for New Hampshire into 2026 as evidence that air quality will not decline when mandatory emissions testing ends.
Compared to 2022, the 2026 projection shows a 2.7% reduction in volatile organic compounds, a 16% reduction in nitrogen oxides, and a 1.9% reduction in carbon monoxide. According to attachments included with the draft implementation plan revision, more of this decline is driven by continued reduction in emissions from vehicles than by reductions from other emissions sources, like power plants, which show less of a decrease.
This is because even without emissions testing in place, modern vehicles are continually becoming more fuel-efficient, Martin said.
The state’s draft petition to leave the Ozone Transport Commission includes modeling that stretches further into the future, to 2038, and shows a continued decrease in nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compound emissions.
NHDES generated this data with an EPA emissions modeling platform that uses a broad assortment of data, including the miles and type of roadways in a state, the number and age of cars on the road, and weather data, to estimate the amount of emissions released into the environment in a given time period, said Pinto de Moura.
This modeling method is widely used and generally reliable, she said. However, she added, the reliability of the platform’s output depends on the breadth of information it is fed.
The effects of ending emissions testing would likely grow over time, said Jack Dibb, emeritus research associate professor in earth sciences at the University of New Hampshire who has studied vehicle emissions. Dibb said he worried the effects of ending the program would compound as more cars’ emissions control systems fail without a testing program in place to make drivers aware or to compel repairs.
“Right away, nothing major’s going to happen, but over time, air quality could seriously degrade,” he said.
In a letter dated Feb. 10, 2025, NHDES Commissioner Scott addressed Rep. Thomas Walsh, a Hooksett Republican and chairman of the House Transportation Committee, about the then-proposed elimination of the emissions testing program.
NHDES did not take a position on the proposal, according to Scott’s letter. But later in the letter, Scott outlined the impact of vehicle emissions on New Hampshire’s air quality,
“Motor vehicles in New Hampshire account for half of the air pollution that causes the formation of ground level ozone,” he wrote.
While the model shows air pollution on the decline overall in New Hampshire, it was not clear how much of an effect on the overall trend the elimination of emissions testing would have on the total pollutants still being released into the atmosphere. NHDES did not run a model to compare air pollution totals if emissions testing were to continue, Martin said.
“If NHDES had modeled a scenario in which (the inspection and maintenance) program was not discontinued, 2026 emission estimates would have been even lower,” he said.
Balancing the burdens of air quality and cost
Last session, proponents of the inspection and maintenance program repeal said it will benefit consumers, particularly those for whom the cost of an inspection and repairs could be a significant burden.
Studies have indeed shown that “the older cars, which are the highest emitters, are predominantly owned by lower income groups,” said Pinto de Moura.
Irwin echoed those concerns.
“There are some legitimate equity concerns associated with inspection and maintenance programs,” he said. “The impacts, the costs and inconveniences of the program, can often fall more heavily on low-income communities.”
But the burden and the harms of air pollution also fall unevenly across society, Pinto de Moura said. 
Air pollution can vary widely within a relatively small area according to factors like traffic patterns and housing proximity to highways. In a 2019 study, Pinto de Moura and fellow Union of Concerned Scientists researcher David Reichmuth demonstrated how that variability is borne unequally by people of color, with Asian American, Black, and Latino residents of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions breathing air that is, on average, 40% more polluted than the air breathed by the typical white resident.
“Exposure itself is inequitable,” Pinto de Moura said. “… Controlling these substances has an incredible impact on communities.”
In New Hampshire specifically, she said, the regional variability of air pollution also means that the state’s overall low average pollution totals could obscure more severe pockets of concentrated pollutants.
“Averages hide reality,” Pinto de Moura said. 
What happens now
The public comment period on draft versions of the implementation plan revision and the state’s application to leave the OTC will end Friday, Nov. 21. A public hearing on the revision will be held at 1:30 p.m. Monday, Nov. 17, at NHDES headquarters in Concord. 
“NHDES will review all comments from interested parties, including EPA,” Martin said.
NHDES will then file those proposals with the EPA — but, as Scott noted in his Feb. 10 letter, it is not clear how long it will take the EPA to review the applications. Generally, it can take the EPA 18 to 24 months to review implementation plan revisions, he wrote; as the emissions testing program is set to end Jan. 31, this would put the state’s policy out of compliance in the interim.
This could put the state at risk to face federal sanctions, Scott wrote, “up to and including loss of federal highway funds.” Sanborn said in his April 25 letter the EPA would consider imposing sanctions on New Hampshire if the state violates its Clean Air Act commitments.
If the EPA determines a state has violated the Clean Air Act, a two-year clock begins to tick, after which the agency can restrict available highway funds as a penalty. Road improvement projects like new interchanges, repaving and resurfacing, lane additions, and more would no longer be eligible for federal grants until the state comes back into compliance, according to the website of the Federal Highway Administration. However, the restriction does not affect problems that would improve safety or emissions, like road improvements designed to reduce crashes and ease polluting traffic.
Even after the review period, it’s not clear whether the EPA will approve the implementation plan revision at all. If the EPA does not approve of the revision as proposed, New Hampshire will have to find another way to meet Clean Air Act requirements, Irwin said.
“Citizen lawsuits,” when individuals or organizations sue those they believe are violating the Clean Air Act, are another possible outcome of the program’s ending ahead of EPA approval. Scott cited the risk of such cases in his Feb. 10 letter, saying they “could pose unquantifiable, but potentially significant, costs for NHDES and NHDOJ to defend.”
However, in his Nov. 3 email, Martin said the draft proposals were “technically and legally sound” and addressed “all the requirements of the Clean Air Act.”
“The fact that New Hampshire is proposing to leave the (Ozone Transport Commission) because of improvements in air quality shows that the CAA is working as Congress intended,” Martin said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/carsozonepact-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-05 05:16:46.766115

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio food pantries reported a sharp increase in demand Monday as federal food assistance was cut by the Trump administration. One said strained resources might not last and made an appeal for donations.
Meanwhile, several statewide Republicans declined to call on President Donald Trump to speed delivery of the benefits after two federal judges on Friday ruled that Trump not only had the power to do so, but also the duty. 
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, has been swept up in the five-week-old government shutdown. 
Republicans don’t have the votes to fund the government, and Democrats are demanding that they extend subsidies to buy health care on exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act. 
Without the extension, the 24 million Americans who get such insurance will see their premiums more than double on average after Jan. 1, health-analysis nonprofit KFF reports.
In the midst of the partial shutdown, the Trump administration said it wouldn’t dip into reserves to keep the SNAP program funded as previous administrations had during earlier shutdowns.
At $186 a month, the average SNAP individual benefit for the 1.45 million Ohioans who receive them might not sound huge.

But when you consider that nearly 40% of recipients are under 18, and a family of three can’t make more than $34,645 a year to qualify, the loss of such assistance is potentially devastating.
The Trump administration had claimed that it couldn’t legally keep the program funded during the shutdown. 
But judges in two federal jurisdictions on Friday said that was false, and that it was legally bound to do so.
On Monday, the Trump administration said it would pay just half the normal benefit in November, and it’s unclear when those payments will go out.
The impact is already being felt at the food pantry at the Broad Street Presbyterian Church in Columbus, said Kathy Kelly-Long, its director. 
“We are crazy busy,” she said Monday. “We were serving 55 families a day in the spring. In August and September it went to 65 a day because food prices keep going up. This past week we’ve been averaging over 80 a day but our food supply hasn’t significantly increased.”
There have been state and local attempts to fill the gaps. 
Gov. Mike DeWine on Friday signed an executive order putting up $25 million in state money for food assistance, and Cuyahoga County Health and Human Services announced that corporate, philanthropic and government entities ponied up $600,000 to help the hungry there. 
But those amounts pale next to the hundreds of millions in monthly SNAP benefits the federal government had until now supplied. 
“For every meal of food we provide, SNAP can provide up to nine meals,” Matt Habash, President and CEO of the Mid-Ohio Foodbank, said on Monday at a press conference in Columbus. 
“We will do everything we can, but we know we can’t make up the difference completely. Food banks are already stretched thin.”
He described the suffering the loss of benefits could cause. 
“We’re bracing for a level of need that we’ve never seen before,” Habash said. 
“Without SNAP, more kids are going to go to school without breakfast. Seniors or people with disabilities will be forced to make meals out of cheap staples like plain rice or pasta or nothing at all with no end in sight.” 
The Franklin County Health Department didn’t seem to have answers for its clients. 
“The federal government has notified the state of Ohio that due to the ongoing government shutdown, SNAP recipients may not receive their November benefits as normally scheduled,” its website said. 
“We are encouraging residents and families to plan ahead as best you can. We will share further information as the federal government provides updates.”
On Monday, volunteers at the pantry on Broad Street in Columbus surveyed people about what prompted them to come. 
“The majority said there was no SNAP and food was too expensive,” Kelly-Long said. 
Where the pantry normally served 10%-15% new families on a given morning, that number jumped to about 25% over the past week, she said.
“That’s an indicator that things have changed,” Kelly-Long said. “People who were doing OK now are not.”
She also clarified who Ohio’s SNAP recipients are.

Some might try to dismiss the crisis by calling recipients freeloaders. 
But last year 62% of Ohio participants were in families with children, more than 43% were in families with older adults or members who are disabled, and more than 35% were in working families, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.
Amid the insecurity, Kelly-Long said neighbors have been stepping up.
“We have had numerous calls from people and organizations asking how can we help? Can we do a food drive? What can we do?” she said. “There’s been a lovely response.” 
She added that she’s conflicted about how to answer. 
The holidays are coming, and the food pantry doesn’t normally have things like stuffing or cornbread mix or canned sweet potatoes, and people will want them.
 At the same time, the pantry always needs staples such as pasta, peanut butter, rice and canned tuna. 
“If people donate those things, that allows me to take my money and spend it on things that aren’t easy to donate like milk, meat and eggs,” Kelly-Long said.
The Mid-Ohio Food Collective said it was appealing to local governments and corporations for bulk donations. 
To individuals, it said, “We need you to donate and volunteer. Visit mofc.org to learn how. If you can’t give money, food, or time, then you can give your voice. Call us at the food bank or connect with us on social media to share your food assistance story. Together, we can make our voices heard.”
Meanwhile, U.S. Sens. Bernie Moreno and Jon Husted, both Republicans, last week signed onto a Republican bill that would have funded SNAP during the shutdown. 
State Attorney General Dave Yost led 18 Republican attorneys general in writing a letter calling on Democrats to fund food assistance by abandoning the health-care subsidies.
That was all while Trump was still claiming that he couldn’t legally fund SNAP. 
Now that two federal judges have said he can and must, spokespeople for the Ohio Republicans won’t answer directly when asked if they would call on the president to do so.

(Photo by Susan Tebben/ Ohio Capital Journal)The sound of the adjourning gavel had barely faded before Ohioans at the Ohio Redistricting Commission’s Friday meeting were expressing their outrage at the congressional map that had been passed, and the process to pass it.
While Republicans have received a lot of heat for having ultimate control of the legislature and the redistricting process itself as the majority party, Democrats have not come out of the process unscathed.
As the meeting ended, attendee Katy Shanahan spoke directly to the commission co-chair, Ohio Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, and Ohio House Minority Leader Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati.
“Nickie and Dani, you should be ashamed of yourself for allowing this to go down in your name,” Shanahan shouted as she was seemingly escorted out of the House Finance hearing room.
The ire came after a unanimous vote by the commission, allowing the adoption of a district map that broadens Republican advantage in the state, giving them an edge in 12 of 15 congressional districts.
Currently, Republicans hold 10 of Ohio’s 15 Congressional districts. Despite the new Republican advantages, Democrats have expressed confidence they can hold their current five seats.
Members of the public who have watched the process go through many years of turmoil — even after the 2018 constitutional amendment that sought to reform the process and make it more transparent — saw the map as an insult, and the Democrats who voted for it as “sell outs.”
Catherine Turcer, executive director of the voting rights advocacy group Common Cause Ohio, called the process a clear “sham” and “dog-and-pony show,” saying commission members on both sides of the aisle went against the constitutionally-mandated process by not deliberating and engaging the public as the process went along.
“They could have improved these maps, they could have been having hearings all month,” Turcer told the Capital Journal.
“Instead, they just did everything in secret, negotiated in secret, and all the members are a great disappointment.”

Ohio-based anti-gerrymandering group Equal Districts Coalition submitted their own map proposal earlier in the year and supported a Democratic proposal that would have seen the state broken up into eight Republican-leaning districts and seven Democratic-leaning districts.
After all was said and done last week, the coalition said the map adopted by the commission was “even more rigged than it was 14 years and two anti-gerrymandering reforms ago.”
The coalition said the Democrats “hung Ohio voters out to dry,” agreeing to districts that “dilute the political power of our state’s communities of color.”
Isaacsohn and Antonio argued that they’d done what they could to stem the gerrymandering they saw happening to their state, but also argued that the five districts that were considered safely Democratic in the map adopted in 2022 are still competitive in the new map.
“Like our previous map, Democrats continue to have a narrow path, winning four to five seats under these lines,” Antonio told the media after the vote.
“This was our only way forward to retain our representation in Congress, the voices of the people of Ohio.”
Antonio’s co-chair on the commission, state Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, acknowledged the map could be a negative or a positive for Republicans depending on the candidates and the campaigns run in the future.
“You don’t have to squint very hard looking at the map to see where Republicans maybe have a better shot at being successful,” Stewart said.
“You don’t have to squint very hard to see where we’re going to have an uphill climb, maybe, if there’s a bad election season for our party, but overall I think it’s a good map.”

Isaacsohn pointed to the “realities of where our state’s leadership is” as to why the two Democrats decided to vote on the map, what they saw as “the best path to … making sure that Ohioans have as many competitive congressional districts as possible.”
“The options were eliminate all three of our members of Congress, or maintain their ability to run and win in 2026, we chose to make sure that Democrats can run in all three of the targeted districts,” Isaacsohn said, referring to the 1st, 9th, and 13th districts, held currently by U.S. Reps. Greg Landsman, Marcy Kaptur and Emilia Sykes, respectively.
Landsman’s seat may end up “one of the most competitive seats in the country” in the next cycle because of the new districts, according to Alex Linser, chair of the Hamilton County Democratic Party.
The Democrats in that county stand ready to get to work for the next election cycle, despite the fact that the county has been “disenfranchised by being split into two districts,” he said.
“The whole situation is very disappointing, but we are where we are, and we have to look forward,” Linser told the Capital Journal on Monday.
The Democratic leaders on the commission received support from national Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair Suzan DelBene, who commended them for “negotiating to prevent an even more egregious gerrymander.”
“This compromise keeps us on the path to taking back the House Majority, and we’ll continue to win across Ohio because voters know it’s House Democrats who are fighting for them,” DelBene said in a statement.
Republicans were also shamed during the process for what anti-gerrymandering advocates saw as a lack of action and a lack of interest in keeping the public in the process.
They defended the process, claiming the bipartisan support of the map proved the process had worked as intended.
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, who was one of the authors of the legislative redistricting reform, claimed the commission led “a fair and open process.”
He added that the new map, which will be in effect until 2031, brings “long-term certainty to congressional district lines.”
Stewart said the Republican caucus in the Ohio House is “pleased” to have 12 districts “in which Republicans have a very good opportunity to be successful.”
“I think when you compare that to the map we have now, I think that satisfies a lot of appetites amongst a very robust Republican caucus, not just here, but in Washington, D.C., amongst our delegation,” Stewart said.
The commission’s bipartisan support blocks any attempt at a referendum that would allow the public to vote on whether to keep the map.
Nevertheless, legal challenges and a future ballot initiative to once again reform redistricting are still on the table.
“I don’t know that we’ve ever passed a map that didn’t result in a court challenge from somebody,” Stewart said.
“I think when you look at the map that complies with every single requirement in the (state) constitution, I think that’d be a very uphill climb and we’re not concerned about any such lawsuit being successful.”

Even as the commission prepared to vote on the map last week, Antonio said the system under which the vote was happening was “broken,” and Isaacsohn said Democrats “are not in control of that process here in Ohio,” leading to their tied-hands negotiation.
The only way to improve would be to go back to the ballot box, they both agreed.
Last year, Ohioans saw an attempt to bring about a citizen-led redistricting process that would have eliminated the elected-official-led Ohio Redistricting Commission, and brought on a vetted panel of Ohioans to do the job.
That initiative met with harsh competition in a counter-campaign that also claimed a “no” vote on the initiative would end gerrymandering.
Republicans on the Ohio Ballot Board, led by Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose who opposed the amendment, wrote ballot language for the proposal claiming it would require gerrymandering.
In the end, the effort went down in defeat with many voters expressing confusion over the ballot language.
Turcer was a leader in the campaign to get the previous ballot initiative passed.
She said she and others learned a lot from that campaign, and plan to try again after they’ve taken the proper time to organize and strategize.
“We will all have to pick up our clipboards, but not right away,” Turcer said.
No matter the political party, the most recent actions showed Turcer that “these folks can’t actually be trusted to create fair districts.”
Asked about a legal challenge to the congressional map, Antonio said she wouldn’t be leading the charge, but “it’s going to happen.”

Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose added his support last week to a proposal requiring Ohioans submit proof of citizenship when they register to vote. But even LaRose acknowledged implementing the idea could be harder than it seems.
Opponents of the idea, meanwhile, insisted the changes are unnecessary and will disenfranchise many Ohioans.
LaRose’s testimony
LaRose urged lawmakers to approve Ohio Senate Bill 153 but offered a caveat about its roll out.
He said it’s provisions “can be successfully implemented according to the terms and timelines” outlined in the bill.
LaRose stressed the decentralized nature of Ohio’s elections system and cautioned that hammering out the details of citizenship verification will take time.
The secretary also spoke favorably about Ohio Senate Bill 293, which requires absentee ballots arrive at the board of elections by election day to be valid.
Ohio law currently allows voters to return ballots within four days of the election so long as they’re postmarked no later than the day before the election.
As recently as 2022, boards would accept ballots 10 days after Election Day.
LaRose told the committee the Department of Justice has contacted his office and the Attorney General’s asserting Ohio’s timeline violates federal law and threatening legal action.
In a March executive order President Donald Trump directed the U.S. Attorney General to “take all necessary action” against states that accept absentee ballots after election day.
LaRose said an election day deadline brings Ohio in line with two thirds of states around the country and avoids a court date.
“My approach is always that it’s better to make changes like this through legislation and not litigation,” he said. “Or, as I like to say, election laws should be made at the statehouse and not at the courthouse.”
LaRose explained his office has worked hard to clear up simple discrepancies in the voter rolls like misspelled names or transposed digits.
But for cases they can’t figure out, the county board attempts to contact the voter and places their registration in “confirmation” status.
“This is where we run into a loophole that needs to be closed,” LaRose said.
Voters can still request and return absentee ballots in confirmation status, and LaRose contends that allows discrepancies to perpetuate.
If a voter doesn’t update mismatched information before an election, the measure would require them to cast a provisional ballot and update their registration at the county board for that vote to get counted.
Opponents warn of harm to eligible voters if Ohio lawmakers require citizenship documents

As for requiring proof of citizenship to vote, LaRose thinks it’s a great idea, but he begged for time.
“All 88 counties will need to upgrade their voter registration system to meet the requirements of that front end citizenship verification,” he said, “as well as the Secretary of State’s office and database that will need to be upgraded to accommodate the additional data required in this legislation.”
State Sen. Willis Blackshear, D-Dayton, said those changes are likely to bog down lines on Election Day, and all those upgrades will cost money.
“It does cost money to do things the right way,” LaRose allowed. “I would argue it costs even more to not get them right.”
Critiques
League of Women Voters of Ohio Executive Director Jen Miller highlighted several changes to rules for petition circulators.
Under the bill, clerical errors could invalidate entire packets of signatures.
Voters who sign must be registered at the address listed at the time they sign — something many counties can’t even confirm, Miller noted.
And circulators would have to wear a badge identifying themselves as “paid” if they received anything of value.
“So, they would have to wear a badge if they had pizza or coffee or a t-shirt or a button,” Miller explained.
That doesn’t actually clear things up for voters, she said, and forces local elections officials to be “badge police.”
Miller also criticized a provision eliminating drop boxes.
In rural counties it can be a half-hour drive to get to the county board of elections, “that’s hard to do during business hours,” she said.
And dropping a ballot in the mail isn’t as reliable as it used to be.
In several counties, the postal service actually sends mail out of state for sorting before sending it back.
And she insisted the citizenship requirements will create new hurdles for rural voters, seniors and married women who change their name.
Research from the University of Maryland Center for Democracy an Civic Engagement indicates roughly 1 in 10 Americans don’t have the documentation they need.
“I want to be clear that every single one of you has constituents in your district who will not overcome these barriers,” Miller said.
“All of my people are from rural Ohio — I know it — and what I can tell you is they are less likely to have their citizenship verification documents that you are expecting.”
Bob McCollister, a Democratic member of the Lawrence County Board of Elections, insisted the proof of citizenship requirements are extreme and misguided.
“Nobody thinks non-citizens should vote,” he said, “but this is a problem that doesn’t exist.”
Despite concerted efforts to track down non-citizen voter fraud, the secretary has turned up only a small handful of cases that even warranted prosecution.
“As we’re doing this,” McCollister said, “we are adding more and more hurdles for legitimate Ohio voters to get tripped up in the system.”
The bill’s sponsor, state Sen. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, asked, as she often does, how many cases of voter fraud are acceptable?
McCollister pushed back, insisting Ohio’s handful of voter fraud prosecutions show fraud is rare and the system is working.
“When I get a headache, I don’t cut my head off to deal with a headache,” he said.
“This is an extreme solution to a problem that we already address.”

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)The issue really isn’t the vicious racism in the texts linked to members of the Kansas Young Republicans, exposed by the news website Politico. It’s too easy to blame the young adults involved. Sure, they aren’t kids. Some have reached 30 and beyond.
Republican adults recently posted culturally insensitive images of Gov. Laura Kelly in a sombrero. The apple, it seems, doesn’t fall far from the tree. 
The deeper issue is that America needs a healthy Republican Party. It needs the balance. Amid this crisis, the party needs to make a decision: hold to its current, ruinous course, or choose democracy and denounce extremism.
Dithering and rudderless progressives, whose indecision and timidity continue to alienate their party’s base, also need work. But we don’t see the same kind of virulent racism from Democratic ranks that soaked those text messages. Kansas Young Republicans chair Alex Dwyer and vice chair William Hendrix participated in the Telegram group chat. Hendrix used racial slurs to refer to Black people, including “n–ga” and “n–guh.”
In a July conversation on the thread about Black people, Hendrix said, “Bro is at a chicken restaurant ordering his food. Would he like some watermelon and Kool-Aid with that?”
Vice President J.D. Vance has defended the Republican texters, but Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach fired Hendrix from a communications job as Politico prepared its report.
“The comments in the chat are inexcusable,” Kobach said. “As soon as the office learned of those messages, Will Hendrix’s employment was terminated.”
Dwyer and Hendrix were photographed at a campaign event with Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson, the Andover Republican now running for governor. Masterson denied any connection to the young people beyond the photo.
The text discussion ranged from antisemitism and love for Adolph Hitler to anti-LGBTQ rhetoric. In the chat, Dwyer and others delved into discussions of how GOP operatives could tarnish a political candidate by linking the individual to white supremacists.
Here’s the key point.
They dismissed the idea because the plan could backfire in a place such as Kansas, where “Young Republicans could end up becoming attracted to that opponent,” Politico wrote.
What a damming admission. These young Republicans considered white supremacy a default belief in parts of the party’s base. And these 20- and 30-somethings didn’t birth these ideas. The party (and the nation) must come to grips with race instead of trying to bury or to whitewash it. The texts are the result of decades dalliances with racial invective. Years of “welfare queens,” Willie Horton ads, and attacks on civil and voting rights.
Right now, the GOP mourns Charlie Kirk, a man who said: “If I see a Black pilot, I’m going to be like, ‘Boy, I hope he’s qualified.’ ”
He also said prominent Black women, including former First Lady Michelle Obama and Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who hold multiple Ivy League degrees, “do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously.”
These are judgements based only on skin color. President Donald Trump just posthumously awarded Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 
On the chat log, someone was asked to guess what room number they had at a hotel.
Dwyer responded “1488,” shorthand among white supremacists when referring to the 14-word, slogan: “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.” The “88” stands for “Heil Hitler,” with “H” being the eighth letter of the alphabet.
Today’s Republican Party bears little resemblance to the party President Abraham Lincoln led. Once Democratic President Lyndon Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act in 1964, the parties essentially switched jerseys. Since then, the GOP generally has opposed civil rights and voting rights. Still, conservatism has long meant limited government, individual freedom, the rule of law and a belief in an enduring moral order.
I’m told that my great-grandfather, as was true with many Black people before Kennedy, was a proud Republican, still honoring Lincoln’s efforts to end slavery.
There are many proud moments from a healthier time for the modern version of the party.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne into Little Rock to enforce the Brown v. Board decision. He desegregated Washington, D.C., and federal bases. He tried to keep segregationists off the federal bench, if you believe Ike biographer David Nichols. A Republican judge Ike appointed in Alabama, Frank Minis Johnson, lifted an injunction that allowed the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s voting rights march to proceed. Arizona U.S. Sen. Barry Goldwater walked into the White House and told President Richard Nixon, amid Watergate, that the time had come for Nixon to step down.
But there’s nothing conservative about exploding the debt. The current administration campaigned on free speech yet has targeted comedians for mocking the president and his cabinet. The “states’ rights” party now wants to occupy the cities of its perceived political opponents over the objection of governors.
That’s a very unhealthy position.
Republicans’ ability to reconnect with proud moments of their past would bode well for their future — and for the nation’s.

Wes Moore (D), meeting with reporters Tuesday, defended his push for mid-cycle congressional redistricting in Maryland as an effort to ensure fairness. Republicans said it's gerrymandering and an effort to eliminate their party in the state. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A Republican lawmaker who successfully challenged redrawn congressional districts three years ago said she is preparing to go back to court if Gov. Wes Moore and other Democrats produce a new set of districts aimed at eliminating the state’s only Republican-held seat.
“This just seems like Kabuki theater,” Del. Kathy Szeliga (R-Baltimore County) said of the governor’s claims that he wants fair congressional districts. “It’s very theatrical, big on theatrics and short on substantial, genuine efforts to serve the citizens of the state of Maryland.”
Moore Tuesday announced the formation of a five-member redistricting advisory commission, chaired by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), to recommend “fair and representative” congressional district maps. Even as he was insisting to reporters that the effort is about ensuring fair districts, however, Moore acknowledged that the push is part of a larger effort to counter mid-cycle hyper-partisan redistricting in Republican-controlled states.
Moore’s redistricting panel is expected to lead to an anticipated special session — perhaps before the end of the year. Maryland is expected to join a national scrum over which party controls the House of Representatives after the 2026 midterm elections.

.The state’s eight current congressional districts were passed after Szeliga successfully filed suit against a legislative redistricting plan in 2022.
Senior Judge Lynne A. Battaglia struck the legislative plan down, calling it “extreme partisan gerrymandering.” Her ruling linked partisan map-making to potential violations of Maryland’s Declaration of Rights.
Democratic lawmakers soon after that ruling crafted the current maps.
‘Do we have fair maps?’
The governor said Tuesday that he is concerned that the maps are not fair.
“I would argue that if you’re looking at the maps that we have right now, that were put together in days, that cut through neighborhoods, that cut through jurisdictions, that I would argue that I’m not sure if these maps actually reflect that,” Moore said. “And so, by going through that process of simply saying, ‘Do we have fair maps?’ I think that’s democracy, and I think that’s fair.”
Those maps are as old as Moore’s nearly three-year career as an elected official. He did not explicitly explain when he became concerned about the fairness of maps the super-majority Democratic legislature drew in place of those offered by then Gov. Larry Hogan (R).
But in comments to reporters Tuesday, Moore himself linked Maryland redistricting to a national skirmish in which states controlled by Republicans and Democrats are trying to slip congressional seats into the hands of their own party using mid-decade redistricting.
Moore said President Donald Trump “cannot just sit there and call certain Republican states and say, ‘Hey, I want you all to find me a congressman here, and find me a congressman there,’ and then expect other states to just simply sit on their hands,” Moore said.
He said that even though states like Maryland redistricted recently, they cannot stand pat “when we are watching this type of attack on our democracy.”
“When we are watching the president of the United States rip up the rules because he knows the only way he can win elections is by actually changing the rules, because you’re not going to win elections on your policies. Your policies are deeply unpopular. So, what do you do? You change the rules,” Moore said of Trump. “And so, the only point that I have, and I have long felt this, and I’m not moving on, is if you have other states that are deciding whether or not they have fair maps, then so will Maryland.”
Moore and other Maryland Democratic leaders face heightened pressure from their own party at the national level.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jefferies (D-N.Y.) has called Moore to discuss the issue. Moore declined to characterize the discussions, calling them private conversations. But Jefferies, in public statements, has urged Maryland to answer the party’s call to redistrict.
Szeliga and other Republicans criticized Moore’s definition of fairness.
“You need a new dictionary to define fair,” Szeliga said.
In Maryland, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans about 2-1. The number of unaffiliated voters is nearly that of Republicans.
Despite that, the state’s eight congressional districts have shifted from an even four-four split 23 years ago to Democrats controlling seven of eight seats today.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) said Moore’s committee aims to “wipe out the Republican Party” in the state.
“Instead of restoring integrity to the process, Governor Moore has chosen to rig the system,” Hershey said in a statement. “This is a partisan power grab disguised as reform, designed to silence dissent and cement one-party rule in Maryland.”
Moore dismissed those like Hershey who believe a fair map might include two or potentially three districts where Republicans could win a seat.
“Part of the reason that I pulled together this bipartisan commission is because I want this bipartisan group of leaders to be able to have conversations with people of our state to determine whether or not we have fair maps within the state of Maryland,” Moore said. “So, for anyone who said they would have a problem with going to the people to determine whether it’s a fair map, I guess my only answer is, ‘What’s your issue with democracy?'”
Advisory panel all but set
Alsobrooks will lead the five-member panel that includes former Attorney General Brian Frosh and Cumberland Mayor Ray Morriss, all appointed by Moore. The panel will also include the House speaker and Senate president, or their designees.
House Minority Leader Jason C. Buckel (R-Allegany) said Morriss, whose city is in Buckel’s district, is in a politically difficult position.
“The lone nominal Republican, after a fruitless search by the Moore Administration to persuade others to participate in this farce, must seriously consider his involvement and recognize that he will obviously be asked to either aid and abet the political crime of stealing representation from Republican citizens, or be a meaningless ‘nay’ vote with little to no real input,” Buckel said in a joint statement with House Minority Whip Del. Jesse T. Pippy (R-Frederick).
Moore pushes for congressional redistricting, sets up confrontation with Senate

“We urged other Republicans and fair-minded leaders not to participate in this charade,” the pair said in the statement. “As it stands, the commission allegedly seeking ‘fair’ congressional districts is made up of four elected Democrats from the Baltimore/DC area, including a sitting US Senator beholden to protecting her party, the most nakedly partisan Attorney General Maryland has perhaps ever seen, and legislative representatives of the Democratic Party who have alternatively already pledged their support for raw gerrymandering for political advantage from the House and conversely committed not to do so in the Senate.”
House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) named Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles) to the panel Tuesday. Wilson is chair of the House Economic Matters Committee.
“I know Chairman Wilson will listen to all perspectives as the Commission hosts public hearings around the State to ensure fair congressional maps,” Jones said in a statement. “Given his representation of a growing region in Charles County, he understands the importance of fair representation and the need to get it right.”
Senate President Bill Ferguson has yet to announce if he will sit on the panel or assign another senator. In a letter last week, Ferguso said that he and the majority of the 34-member Democratic Caucus oppose mid-cycle redistricting. A mid-cycle redistricting bill sent to the Senate is seen as a nonstarter.
Moore and Ferguson’s office confirmed the pair are scheduled to meet over dinner later this week.
“I respect his opinion,” Moore said of Ferguson. “We have a very fundamental disagreement on this. I think this moment requires urgency, and I think this moment requires us to really think critically and make sure that the people’s voices can be heard in a very practical and legal way.”
Ferguson did not meet with reporters Tuesday. A spokesperson, when asked about Moore’s comments earlier in the day, referred a reporter to a statement issued by Ferguson that same morning. In it, Ferguson called for public meetings in all eight districts, among other things.
“Marylanders’ voices remain central to this process, and these public meetings will provide an opportunity for voters to hear about the unique legal barriers in Maryland – barriers that could unintentionally give Donald Trump another one or two of Maryland’s congressional seats should this effort backfire in our courts,” Ferguson said.
“The Senate Democratic Caucus understands that this is an unbalanced risk reward calculation. It is why there is overwhelming concern about Maryland joining the mid-cycle redistricting wars rather than focusing on tangible, immediate policies to protect our State from this lawless Trump Administration,” his statement said.
‘We’ve got it teed up’
A schedule for meetings of the commission has not been announced. But Moore told reporters “the commission’s work has already commenced.”
He said he expected the panel would use technology to “hear the voice of the people in public ways” leaving open the door to virtual meetings or some sort of hybrid approach combined with in-person testimony.
Expectations among lawmakers in the House and Senate is that Moore’s panel could lead to a special session before the end of the year. Many are looking to the first week of December.
The governor on Tuesday would not commit to a special session nor rule it out.
“There is no state that has been more exposed to the cruelty of the Trump administration than the state of Maryland,” Moore said. “I will use any and all tools at my disposal to make sure that my people are protected all across the state of Maryland, and that includes I will never take the option of calling a special session, which is my right as the governor, I will never take that option off the table.”
Meanwhile, Szeliga said she is preparing for the possibility of new maps. She and U.S. Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st) have already talked to the legal team that represented her in 2022.
“We haven’t signed any papers, but we’ve got it teed up to go right back to the Supreme Court” of Maryland, she said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_4543-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-11-05 07:17:33.069499

Ford/Maryland Matters)For a third straight year, Maryland schools made slight gains on the annual report card released Tuesday by the state Department of Education.
The state’s report card grades schools on a scale of one to five stars, with five stars going to schools that earn a score of at least 75% on a formula that measures overall school performance.
In the 2024-25 school year, 43% of schools earned four or five stars, up from 41% in the 2023-24 school year. According to the report, 98 schools garnered a five-star rating in the 2024-25 school year, an increase from 91 the previous school year.
Once again, Baltimore County schools led the way with 23 five-star schools, the most in the state. The county’s Eastern Technical High School received the most points in the state with a 92, one point higher than two years ago.
For the second year in a row, the Academy of Health and Sciences at Prince George’s Community College finished in second place, with 89 points.
Also for a second year, two of Worcester County’s 11 schools earned five stars while the other nine all got a four-star rating, for getting a score of at least 60 out of 100 points on the grading formula. The two schools to receive five stars were Pocomoke and Snow Hill high schools.
“I am incredibly proud of our schools for earning four- and five-star ratings across the board,” Worcester County Superintendent Annette Wallace said in a statement. “These results reflect the unwavering commitment to excellence by our educators, staff, students, and families. Worcester County continues to be an educational leader in Maryland, and today’s report card release is yet another reminder of how our community’s investment in public education is transforming lives.”
State education boards approve additional metrics to boost student achievement

But this year’s report may be one of the last under the five-star system: The state still plans to assess overall student achievement but with a new rating system, which could happen in the 2026-27 school year.
One reason for the change is a complaint that the current report card does not show enough student growth. State Board President Joshua Michael, for example, said schools could have increased their scores by 7 percentage points from the previous report, but still kept the same star rating.
According to the department’s data, about 986, or nearly 76% of the slightly more than 1,300 schools maintained the same star rating from the previous school year and in 2023-24.
“The biggest problem right now is that growth is not being recognized and differentiating enough between schools,” Michael said during a briefing with reporters. “Schools are not being rewarded for growth enough in our report cards. Quite frankly, [the] report card right now is too much a proxy of poverty in our schools, and we need more factors that are going to help us differentiate.”
Some of the criteria schools are measured on include academic achievement, progress in English language proficiency, and readiness for post-secondary success. According to the department, schools get a star for achieving at least 45 points.
Part of the star ratings are based on results from the Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program (MCAP), which measures a student’s proficiency in math, English and science.
Less than a week after she officially took over in April 2024, state Superintendent Carey Wright announced the creation of a state Assessment and Accountability Task Force to assess student achievement.
That came as 76% of Maryland schools got three of five stars in the December 2023 report card, but only 47% of students in third to eighth grades in that school year were rated proficient in English language arts on state tests, and only 25% were proficient in math.
Wright called the current rating system Tuesday “convoluted.”
“When we started digging into it, we just found out that the system that we have right now is really not differentiating amongst schools. I mean, they’re stuck,” she said.
“We’re at 50% proficiency. That means you’ve got 50% that aren’t [proficient]. So that means there’s a lot of kids at the bottom,” Wright said Tuesday. “So, one of the things that we’re looking at is, what if we measure the growth of the bottom 25% in addition to measuring the growth overall?”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The school board voted to accept a report in December 2024 that included recommendations to revising the current ratings system, designing all MCAP tests using the most up-to-date research and developing a comprehensive communication strategy “to showcase positive stories about the assessment system and how schools and districts use the assessment results..”
An accountability advisory group was formed to assess the task force’s recommendations. It is scheduled to present an update on possible next steps toward a new rating system at the school board’s Dec. 9 meeting.
Harford County Superintendent Sean Bulson, who attended Tuesday’s state school board meeting in Baltimore, said in a brief interview he’s pleased with the star-rating results in his school district: Out of 55 schools, seven earned five stars and another 28 had four stars.
But Bulson said he wouldn’t mind seeing the star-rating system gone.
“If I had a real choice, I’d make it go away and have people go back and just look at look at the [student] achievement,” he said. “You can’t just look at one element because kids are more complex than one test score, right?
“So, while the idea is to give something, give people kind of an easy comparison point, I think it obscures a lot of the real work that’s happening,” Bulson said. “I don’t think it helps people gain a good understanding of what’s happening in the schools … and it’s more complex than one rating.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Thaina-Joyce-at-Cold-Spring-Elementary-8-27-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-05 06:16:51.128974

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)Voters were giving the go-ahead Tuesday for the state to make stock market investments with payroll taxes collected for Washington’s new long-term care program.
A measure to amend the state constitution was passing by an overwhelming margin of 56.8% to 43.2%. Results will be updated as more votes are tallied.
If Tuesday’s results for Senate Joint Resolution 8201 hold, it will allow the Washington State Investment Board to legally handle assets of the WA Cares program in a similar manner as it does pension and retirement accounts. The fund had a balance of $2.9 billion on Sept. 30.
“Voters are sending a clear message to lawmakers that they support strengthening this essential benefit for seniors and people with disabilities,” said Ana Ascanio, manager for the Approve 8201 campaign.
Passing the measure will grow the long-term care fund by billions of dollars, help keep premiums low and create opportunities for the benefit to become more generous, she added.
The state constitution generally bars investing public money in the stock of private companies.
That means state and local governments are limited to fixed-income securities like government bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit that are less risky and pay lower returns. The WA Cares account is now subject to this limitation.
Pension and retirement accounts are exempt from that prohibition. The ballot measure would add the Long-Term Services and Supports Trust account to the list of exempt funds. The state investment board, which uses a long-term, diversified investment strategy, could then decide if it wants to invest in private equity funds and buy stock of private companies, or not. 
Supporters argued that investing in the stock market would lead to larger returns in the long run, ensuring premiums stay low and the program is sustainable. They noted in the campaign that annual returns for pension funds have averaged 8.9% in the past three decades because of decisions by the state investment board.
Opponents argued it would be “financial roulette” and a breach of the state’s fiduciary responsibility because it would put taxpayer dollars at risk should the economy or market crash. They argued that investing in municipal bonds may earn less, but it provides a broad public benefit by helping local governments carry out projects.
Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson and Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, backed the ballot measure.
Service Employees International Union 775, which represents 55,000 long-term care workers in Washington, Montana and Alaska, spent $2.5 million to pass it. That is five times more than it spent in 2020 when a similar measure lost by a margin of 54.4% to 45.6%. 
Last November, voters defeated a statewide initiative to make WA Cares participation voluntary rather than mandatory for workers. Braun said that was an indication of a broader endorsement of the program.
He said supporters of the 2020 measure didn’t do a good enough job communicating that the Washington State Investment Board could produce higher earnings on WA Cares Fund assets that could translate into lower premiums and more benefits.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/thurston-county-ballot-processing-center-2-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-11-05 00:56:40.469105

(Photo by Amanda Brown for New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey Democrats triumphed in Assembly races Tuesday, and are set to expand their majority next year after winning three long-sought seats in the 8th and 21st districts and threatening to flip four others.
The apparent victories will give Democrats a two-thirds supermajority in the lower chamber for the first time since 2019 and will expand their majority to its largest since the party won 66 seats in 1973 on the heels of President Richard Nixon’s impeachment.
“Tonight, voters decisively backed Democratic legislative leadership in New Jersey and sent a clear message to MAGA extremists whose policies have substantially driven the cost of living up,” said Heather Williams, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.

Democrats went into Tuesday night with 52 of the Assembly’s 80 seats, a majority just one vote shy of two-thirds of the chamber. That majority will likely expand to at least 55 — a historical high watermark — and could stretch further as election officials tally provisional and late-arriving mail ballots over the next week.
The party’s Assembly victories came the same night it held the governor’s mansion, with Democratic Mikie Sherrill winning a decisive victory in the gubernatorial race against Republican Jack Ciattarelli.
Support for Democratic Assembly candidates swelled everywhere, but it brought the party wins in New Jersey’s suburban districts.
The wave carried Garwood Councilman Vincent Kearny and Andrew Macurdy to victory over Union County Republican Assemblywomen Michele Matsikoudis and Nancy Munoz in the 21st District.
It pushed Hammonton High School teacher Anthony Angelozzi to victory in the 8th District’s repeat race. His running mate, Assemblywoman Andrea Katz (D-Burlington), also sailed to reelection, defeating Assemblymen Michael Torrissi (R-Burlington) and former Assemblyman Brandon Umba, who lost his seat to Katz two years ago in a nail-biter.
Though Republicans still hold the 8th District’s Senate seat, the Assembly victories are a coup for Burlington County Democrats. Their party has not held both of the 8th District’s Assembly seats at any point since 1973.

“New Jersey voters sent a clear message tonight,” said Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex). “They want leaders who put people first — not politics — and who focus on uniting our communities rather than dividing them. They believe in New Jersey’s Democratic Party to deliver results and invest in a future for all working families. Together with Governor-elect Sherrill and our legislative partners, we will keep building a stronger, fairer, and more affordable New Jersey for everyone.”
In the 3rd District, where a Republican truck driver’s surprise win ousted New Jersey’s longest-serving Senate president in 2021, Assembly members Heather Simmons (D-Gloucester) and Dave Bailey (D-Gloucester) led Republican challengers Tuesday night and were expected to win reelection, though their margin remained slim compared to other districts.
Two contests in Republican districts that were not expected to be competitive were too close to call Tuesday night.
Margins in the 25th District, where Republican incumbents Aura Dunn (R-Morris) and Christian Barranco (R-Passaic) faced challenges from nutritionist Marisa Sweeney and Morristown Councilman Steve Pylypchuk, were razor-thin.
Tuesday night, Dunn was in first place, about 650 votes ahead of Sweeney. Barranco was about 250 votes behind Sweeney, and Pylypchuk trailed the pack.
A Democratic victory in the 25th would make history. No Democrat has won an Assembly seat in the 25th district at any point since the state adopted its 40-district map in 1973.
The Republican State Legislative Committee said it always expected Tuesday’s races to be difficult and appeared to blame GOP gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli, at least partly, for the party’s losses.
“Despite underperformance at the top of the ticket we are proud of our investment in a robust get-out-the-vote operation that was crucial to maximizing GOP turnout and mitigating losses in key State Assembly races,” said Edith Jorge-Tuñón, the committee’s president.
New Jersey’s 2nd Legislative District also saw an unexpectedly tight race Tuesday. Incumbent Assemblyman Don Guardian (R-Atlantic), a former Atlantic City mayor, was in first place by about 1,000 votes Tuesday — but his running mate, incumbent Assemblywoman Claire Swift (R-Atlantic), ran behind both of their Democratic challengers.
Fewer than 300 votes separated Swift and attorney Maureen Rowan and Pleasantville Councilwoman Joanne Falmuro.
The contests in the 2nd and 25th Districts will likely be decided by provisional and late-arriving mail ballots, and results there could take a week or more to come into sharp relief.
Result tallies will shift over the coming days as election officials count provisional and late-arriving mail-in ballots. Under New Jersey law, officials must count mail ballots postmarked by Election Day that reach them no later than six days after the election.
Such ballots are typically few in number relative to overall turnout, and provisional ballots cannot be counted until after all valid mail ballots have been processed and tallied.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Constellation Energy began making its case Tuesday that it should be the go-to company if Maryland expands power generation within its borders.
The company said Tuesday that it had submitted proposals, under the state’s new permitting fast-track process, for two natural gas power plant concepts and for new battery energy storage facility. In a news release, the company also floated the idea of improvements or expansion at its Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, but acknowledged those projects are longer-term and would require an infusion of private or public dollars to move forward.
The fast-track project approval was one of a number of plans approved this year by lawmakers anxious to find ways to curb voters’ soaring utility bills, by increasing the supply of power and bringing down costs.
Only two other companies submitted applications by the Oct. 31 deadline for “fast-track” project approval by the Maryland Public Service Commission: One proposal, from Alpha Generation, would increase the capacity and efficiency of the gas-fired Keys Energy Center in Prince George’s County’s Brandywine, while the other, from Total Civil Construction & Engineering, is confidential.
The turmoil over high energy bills has drawn one other potential player. The Exelon Corp., owner of three Maryland utilities that is currently prohibited from generating power, has started to make the case to lawmakers that it should be allowed to build power plants in Maryland — and use ratepayer dollars to do so.
Utilities like Exelon can currently own power transmission infrastructure, but not generation. They enjoy a monopoly in their service territories, but are regulated by the state’s Public Service Commission.

Exelon has not yet filed project plans with the PSC, but is studying possible projects and making the case for being allowed to do so. But in a statement Tuesday, Constellation President and CEO Joe Dominguez drew a sharp distinction between his company’s proposal and Exelon’s plans.
“Importantly, all our investments have been and will be done without any cost to Maryland families and businesses. We are not now and never will be a monopoly that seeks guaranteed profits,” Dominguez said. “We are a company that competes for its opportunities just like all our hardworking customers do — every single day.”
It’s not clear precisely where Constellation plans to put a new gas-powered plant or the battery storage facility in proposal. Locations were redacted from the company’s filing with the PSC. But both proposals make reference to the Baltimore Gas & Electric territory.
Any of the projects would be placed on Constellation property already developed for power facilities, said Mason Emnett, the company’s senior vice president for public policy. That avoids the need for land acquisition, Emnett said, and by “using land that is otherwise dedicated to power generation right now … we’re not disturbing greenfield space, or something like that.”
Besides Calvert Cliffs, Constellation\ power facilities in Maryland are the Conowingo Dam, the Perryman natural gas plant in Aberdeen, the Philadelphia Road oil plant in Baltimore and three wind farms in Western Maryland.
Constellation said in it application that it would submit both gas-plant projects to the regional electric grid, operated by PJM Interconnection, by the end of April 2026.
Constellation’s battery project would be spread out between four parcels of land, and could contribute up to 800 megawatts back to the grid at its maximum output.
The battery storage project fell short on one criterion for “fast-track” eligibility: Its effective load carrying capacity, which measures its ability to contribute to the grid at peak times, is 58%, below the fast-track program’s requirement of 65%. Constellation wrote that it was “nevertheless” proposing the project, in part because of its “magnitude,” and its zero-emissions profile.
Exelon wants to build a power plant in Maryland, reversing decades of deregulation policy

“This project fits squarely within Maryland’s policy priorities of encouraging additional generation while managing emissions,” the filing reads.
Gas proposals generate pushback; logistical hurdles remain
But fast-tracking natural gas powered plants remains a concern for environmental groups, who argue that their emissions pose health concerns and imperil the state’s ambitious goals to reduce fossil fuel emissions and rely on clean energy.
The fast-track proposal from Alpha Generation, for improvements to the Keys Energy Center in Brandywine, has been targeted by community members who have long raised environmental justice concerns over the number of polluting industrial facilities concentrated in the majority-Black area.
The Brandywine/TB Southern Region Neighborhood Coalition earned an “Informal Resolution Agreement” with federal and state agencies in 2019, after it submitted a Title VI complaint arguing that a new power plant proposed for the community was discriminatory. In a statement Tuesday, BTB Coalition President Kamita Gray called on the PSC to pause the project at Keys.
“Maryland can’t claim to be a leader on environmental justice while fast-tracking pollution in Black communities that already did their share,” Gray said.
Constellation has offered two options for a new gas-powered plant — a larger facility with a maximum output of 564 megawatts, and a smaller one with a maximum output of 150 megawatts. The company says either could be operational by June 2029.
But there is a question about whether existing gas pipelines can bring enough fuel to the sites Constellation is considering for the two plants. It has inquired with Exelon’s Baltimore Gas & Electric about gas service to the area, its application says.
“If the site requires a significant expansion of the gas delivery system, that’s a whole ‘nother permitting and infrastructure deployment enabler that we don’t control,” Emnett said.
But he said Constellation is otherwise well-positioned to add natural gas generation capacity, because it already owns six critical gas turbines that it could move into Maryland.
“The generally held belief is: It’ll take you about five years to get through the ordering process and have a new turbine delivered,” Emnett said. “We already have the turbines. We are able to move as quickly as the permitting and selection and surrounding construction process allows.”
Logistics aside, climate groups say natural gas is the wrong way to go if the state hopes to meet its clean-energy goals.

Under state law, Maryland must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 60% from 2006 levels by 2031, and reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2045. Gov. Wes Moore (D) issued an executive order requiring his administration to plan to reach 100% clean energy by 2035.
In a filing with the PSC, more than a dozen climate groups, including the Action Network, the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club, wrote that they “strenuously disagree with the assumption that constructing more gas-fired generation” could achieve Maryland’s goals for increased energy affordability and reliability.
They wrote that state law requires that the PSC take Maryland’s climate mandates into consideration during its decision-making. The law creating the fast-track program also requires the PSC to approve four projects that don’t generate emissions for every one project that does, the advocates noted.
In his statement Tuesday, Dominguez acknowledged the climate concerns with natural gas proposals.
“We believe that natural gas generation should be an option, but there are pros and cons to consider and, quite naturally, we do not want to build what our state does not want,” Dominguez wrote. “Therefore, our plan presents natural gas generation as one of a number of options, with an explanation of the utility work that will be needed to secure this option.”
But Brittany Baker, Maryland director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said state regulators and lawmakers don’t need to reject new gas purely for the climate outcomes — she argues that new gas would be costly, as well.
“As soon as we run the numbers, it will be clear that all of the additional infrastructure that’s required to build any new gas is not going to make any sense for utility bills,” Baker said. “It’s going to raise bills — not lower them.”
If policymakers “jump through all the hoops,” and decide to build new gas anyway, “they’re going to have to deal with us,” she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Baker said she’s optimistic that the state won’t pursue a new gas plant, but if it happens, her organization is planning on “bringing in a microphone” to the affected community, to help residents share concerns about emissions.
“We’re not going to allow new gas in the state,” Baker said. “We’re going to fight it with everything we have.”
Nuclear expansion is distant, but could be fueled by data centers
Largely undiscussed is the third Constellation proposal, nuclear power, largely because of the prohibitive costs.
Emnett said adding a third nuclear reactor to Calvert Cliffs would probably cost around $10 billion. A small modular reactor might shave several billion from the price, he said, while making technological upgrades, which could boost output by 10%, would probably cost around $1 billion.
The hefty price tags have Constellation turning to the well-heeled companies that operate data centers, which come with immense power needs. Emnett said Constellation is in talks with large-load customers who could sponsor upgrades at Calvert Cliffs or other sites, in exchange for pulling power from those sites.

He said such an agreement could provide Constellation with the confidence to apply for a new 20-year license for Calvert Cliffs, where licenses on the two reactors expire in 2034 and 2036.
But securing an agreement is easier said than done.
“We talk to customers about risk-sharing arrangements, but from the customer’s perspective, it’s difficult to bear a lot of that development risk when that’s not their expertise,” Emnett said. “They’re not power developers.”
State officials could take steps to back nuclear, and encourage Constellation to keep operating the facility – or grow its footprint, Emnett said.
This year’s Next Generation Energy Act created a nuclear procurement program within the PSC that would use ratepayer funds, with regulations due by 2027. The law also directed state government to explore cost-sharing agreements with other states that could mitigate the risk of nuclear development.
Emnett said Constellation backed an unsuccessful proposal in the 2025 General Assembly that would have employed state funds to act as a backstop for a federal nuclear tax credit that could sunset in 2032.
But Constellation is aiming to lean on investor funds, he said.
“That’s the pathway that we spent most of our time focusing on, because we think it’s more productive to use private dollars instead of public dollars to the extent possible,” Emnett said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC08213-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-05 06:00:59.595056

At the Embassy Suites in Virgina Beach, the crowd for incumbent Attorney General Jason Miyares was hopeful early on election night.
The crowd held out hope as the governor and lieutenant governor’s races were quickly called in favor of Democratic candidates Abigail Spanberger and Ghazala Hashmi.
Democrats sweep Virginia’s statewide races, reclaiming full control of executive branch

But the mood dulled as screens around the party showed Fox News calling the attorney general’s race for Miyares’ opponent, Jay Jones.
Former governor George Allen came to the stage just before 10 p.m. to acknowledge the Democrats’ sweep of statewide offices and introduce Miyares.
“It’s exceedingly difficult for those lower on the ticket to overcome … the political gravity at the top of the ticket,” Allen said.
The former governor praised the work Miyares did as attorney general and said Miyares was “by far leading the ballot.”
The attorney general’s race, where the candidates were separated by about 4% around 10:30 p.m., was considerably closer than the other statewide races, where Democrats were leading by double-digits.
Miyares thanked his supporters and voters for giving him four years in the job. He said he wished his opponent – who was caught up in a scandal over the last few weeks about text messages alluding to violence against a Republican lawmaker – the best in succeeding him.
“As the hallmark of our democracy, I wish Jay Jones the best in this job. I know given the circumstances of the last six weeks, many of my supporters will find that difficult, but the reason I wish Jay the best is because we, the people of Virginia, need it,” Miyares said.
He struck a conciliatory tone, noting that differences of political opinion are not the end-all and said Democrats assuming power would do well to remember that the pendulum will swing back.
“It always does,” Miyares said to cheers.

(Anne-Marie Caruso | New Jersey Monitor)BRIDGEWATER — Republican Jack Ciattarelli’s third gubernatorial bid ended in defeat Tuesday evening within 90 minutes of polls closing. 
Ciattarelli’s pledges to reduce property taxes, increase public safety, and cooperate with President Donald Trump’s administration weren’t enough to overcome Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill’s push to paint him as a Trump sycophant unwilling to put New Jersey’s needs over the president’s.
Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, conceded his loss at about 10 p.m. after he said he called Sherrill to wish her well. He said he continues to believe in his “brand of leadership.”
“I haven’t stopped believing because of the outcome of tonight’s election,” he told a crowd of his supporters gathered in a ballroom at the Bridgewater Marriott. “It is my hope that Mikie Sherrill has heard us in terms of what we need to do to make New Jersey that place where everybody can once again feel they can achieve their American dream.”
Mikie Sherrill celebrates win in NJ governor’s race, as supporters cheer: ‘Blue is back!’

Sherrill’s win was part of a Democratic wave that has put some GOP-controlled Assembly seats in jeopardy of flipping (all 80 Assembly seats were also on the ballot Tuesday). Ciattarelli noted in his remarks Tuesday that New Jersey’s Democratic Party will continue controlling all levers of state government once Sherrill succeeds incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy (D) in January.
“Our job doesn’t end. Yes, Republicans are the minority party, but that means also being the loyal opposition, and continuing to ensure that our voice is heard,” he said.
Ciattarelli said the campaign left him more passionate than ever that issues ranging from public school curriculum to “overdevelopment” to high taxes to public safety need to be solved.
“Because if they’re not, I fear for the future of New Jersey,” he said.













































































A subdued crowd remained at the Ciattarelli party after the race was called for Sherrill around 9:20 p.m. People came prepared for a victory, sporting “It’s time!” t-shirts and “Make New Jersey Great Again” hats. 
Jacqueline Capriotti of Howell said she wasn’t surprised by the outcome, but was shocked the result wasn’t closer. Capriotti said she hopes that both parties learn from recent elections that they should “open up their tents.” 
“I feel we really need to heal a divide and we need to come together, find common ground, and find the core principles of what really makes us Americans in this country,” she said.
Ciattarelli, who vowed after losing the 2021 gubernatorial race to Murphy that he would seek the office again, formally launched his latest bid in April 2024. Since then, he said Tuesday night, he made it his mission to visit all 564 of New Jersey’s towns. He said he stopped by more than 600 diners during this campaign.
“I’ve had more BLTs and onion soups over the past 18 months, more than anybody on record,” he said.

Sen. Vandana Slatter faced a challenge from a more moderate candidate within her own party, and Victoria Hunt from a Republican opponent hoping to chip away at the lopsided balance of power in favor of Democrats in Olympia. 
For each, it was their first time defending their seats. Both were promoted from the House to the Senate via appointment. 
On Tuesday, Hunt, of Issaquah, comfortably led former state lawmaker Chad Magendanz, a moderate Republican, by a margin of 54.5% to 45.3%.
Slatter was ahead of her former state House colleague, Rep. Amy Walen, D-Kirkland,  56% to 42.3% after Tuesday’s ballot drop. 
Meanwhile, Rep. Edwin Obras trailed fellow Democrat and Burien mayor Kevin Schilling. Schilling, considered the moderate candidate in the race, narrowly led with about 50.2% of the vote to Obras’ 47.2%. Roughly 350 votes separate the candidates.
President Donald Trump loomed over the off-year elections, even in the Democrat-on-Democrat battles. Progressive candidates touted their pushback against Trump and tried to link their opponents to the president’s policies.
Five other Democrats in safe western Washington seats are sailing toward re-election. 
Democratic Reps. Janice Zahn and Osman Salahuddin were trouncing Republican opponents in Tuesday’s returns. And state Sens. Tina Orwall, D-Des Moines, and Emily Alvarado, D-Seattle, as well as Rep. Brianna Thomas, ran unopposed.

Kaohly Her scored a major upset over Mayor Melvin Carter Tuesday, emerging as St. Paul’s first Hmong-American and first woman mayor, capitalizing on voters’ dissatisfaction after Carter’s two terms. 
Her, who came to the United States as a three-year-old refugee from Laos following the Vietnam War, campaigned on competency amid a city-wide malaise, underscored by the closure of downtown’s only grocery store and another in the Midway, which has struggled from a lack of development despite the presence of the professional soccer stadium. A rent control initiative passed with Carter’s backing in 2021 has been deemed such a failure that the City Council earlier this year exempted units built after 2004 — at Carter’s urging. 
Her’s surprisingly strong challenge came after jumping into the race in August.
St. Paul has struggled to recover from the pandemic, suffering from high office vacancy rates and resulting property tax increases on homeowners.
Her joins a City Council comprising seven women, making St. Paul a rare city that’s entirely women-led.
Her, 52, spent 15 years in banking, raised children and became Carter’s policy aide. She’s represented her district since her election in 2018.
Carter, who had been considered a dynamic and rising star in the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, will now be forced to pick up the pieces after a difficult loss.

After the first round of unofficial voting results, Mayor Melvin Carter had just above 40% of the total, with state Rep. Kaohly Her winning just above 38%.   
In the next tabulation, candidates with the fewest votes are eliminated; their voters’ second choices will then be apportioned. This process continues until a candidate has a majority. 
Her’s surprisingly strong challenge comes after jumping into the race in August, underscoring voters’ dissatisfaction with the state of the city, regardless of the final outcome. 
St. Paul has struggled to recover from the pandemic, suffering from high office vacancy rates and resulting property tax increases on homeowners. The city’s only downtown grocery store closed earlier this year, and another closed in the Midway, which has struggled from a lack of development despite the presence of the professional soccer stadium. A rent control initiative passed with Carter’s backing in 2021 has been deemed such a failure that the City Council earlier this year exempted units built after 2004 — at Carter’s urging.

Carter kept loyal supporters in his camp, however, which could still propel him to victory. 
Ron Dexter, 85, was walking into the Martin Luther King Jr. Recreation Center to vote for Carter Tuesday. “I met him once. I liked him. I like that he’s Black. That’s good for the community,” said Dexter, a Navy veteran who retired after a career as an information technology specialist at the University of Minnesota.
No matter the outcome, Carter — long considered a rising star in Democratic-Farmer-Labor politics — will faces fresh questions about his approach to both governing and campaigning after what would be a narrow victory over Her, who was once his policy aide. 
If she wins, Her would be the city’s first Hmong-American and first woman mayor.

Wes Moore (D) if the election were held today a new poll says, but that's actually a good baseline for his reelection hopes this far out from the 2026 election, according to the pollster.","A year away from the 2026 election, 49% of those polled said they would vote for incumbent Democratic Gov. Wes Moore. (File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Fewer than 50% of registered Maryland voters said they would support Gov. Wes Moore (D) if the election were held today, according to a poll released Wednesday.
But that’s actually a good baseline for Moore for an election that’s still a year away, said Mileah Kromer, director of the poll produced for the Institute of Politics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
“I was the most interested, this far out from the election, in what Wes Moore’s vote share right now is, because there’s no Republican candidate nominee and Wes Moore is obviously going to be the nominee for the Democratic Party,” Kromer said. “So, it’s Wes Moore versus generic Republican versus generic other candidates. I think the more important thing is he’s sitting at almost 50% of the electorate right now.”
The poll found 49% of those surveyed said they would support Moore. Nearly three-in-10 voters said they would support a generic Republican candidate. Twelve percent said they would pick “some other candidate,” and 10% said they were undecided.
The UMBC poll surveyed 810 Maryland adults, who included 757 registered voters. The poll, conducted Oct. 21-25, has an overall margin of error of 3.4%. The margin of error among registered voters is 3.5%.
The bulk of Moore’s support comes from voters in his own party. More than three-quarters of registered Democrats said they would vote for Moore.
On the Republican side, just 7% said they would consider crossing party lines to vote for Moore.
In Maryland, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 2-1 margin.
Unaffiliated voters were evenly split on Moore. A year out from the 2026 election, 31% said they would vote for the incumbent. An identical number of voters said they would support a Republican candidate, while 18% said they would vote for someone else and 20% were undecided.
Poll: Moore job approval remains steady even as independent voters trend away

The split is another sign of how Moore struggles with unaffiliated voters.
Kromer released the first part one of her poll Tuesday. Data in that release showed Moore has lost support among unaffiliated voters since the institute’s inaugural poll in October 2024.
In Tuesday’s release, 56% of unaffiliated voters disapproved of Moore’s job performance, compared to 46% in the university’s October 2024 survey. It is the second consecutive poll showing an increase in dissatisfied unaffiliated voters.
There are nearly 1 million unaffiliated voters in the state, almost as many as there are registered Republicans.
More evidence of “very polarized” politics
When it comes to who should control Congress, the survey broke down along party lines.
Nearly two-thirds of those responding said they want the Democratic Party to win control in November. About 32% said they favored Republican control. Seven percent said they had no preference.
Those results are nearly identical to the institute’s October 2024 poll which asked about control of the U.S. Senate.
“It’s exactly what you could expect,” Kromer said. “It definitely speaks to our very polarized nature of politics. It’s just another piece of evidence.”
Voting for rather than against a candidate
Most of the voters — 63% — surveyed said they vote in every election without exception. About 31% said they vote in almost every election.
The poll, citing state board of elections figures, noted that “just under half of registered voters cast a ballot in the 2022 midterm elections.”
The survey also asked voters why they vote as they do.
Half of voters said they were unlikely to vote for a candidate of a party different from their own. Forty-six percent said they would cross party lines to vote for a candidate.
And when it comes to motivations, 52% of voters said they cast a ballot to support a candidate they like. Nearly one-in-five people responding said they cast a ballot mostly to oppose a candidate they dislike. Twenty-seven percent said they are motivated by a little of each.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I personally thought it was a very interesting idea: When you go to the ballot box in Maryland, do you vote because you really like the candidate — like your candidate — or do you go to vote against the other guy or gal?” Kromer asked.
“And so, 52% of voters say they cast their ballot to mostly to support a candidate they like,” she said. Marylanders are voting because they like the people they are voting for, not to keep the people they don’t like out of office — at least at this juncture.”
Plenty of public cynicism to go around
While Maryland voters said they would prefer to see Democrats control Congress, they expressed a lot of cynicism and distrust.
Those surveyed were asked which party they trusted, health care and public education were the only two issues in which either party received majority support. In both cases, more than 50% of those surveyed said they trusted the Democratic Party.
Democrats received a slight edge on the state budget and immigration.
When it comes to crime and public safety, 39% of those who responded said they trusted Republicans compared to 38% who said Democrats.
Those same respondents found both parties wanting when asked how well a series of traits describes the Democratic and Republican Parties.
“I would care about this … if I was a member of a political party and an elected official. I would want to increase these numbers,” Kromer said. “I would not want only 46% of Marylanders to say the Democrats care about ordinary people. Only 22% say that about the Republicans. Like you would want those numbers to get higher. Period.
“Those are the numbers …yeah, Democrats are up. They’re doing much better that Republicans, but everybody could do better,” she said.
When it comes to “getting things done,” 27% of those surveyed highly ranked the Democratic Party compared to 21% who said Republicans
Nearly identical percentages said both parties “keep promises.”
“I don’t think anybody should be particularly surprised by the cynicism over things like getting things done,” Kromer said. “We’re more than a month into a government shutdown.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/state-house-flag-newsletter-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-05 03:56:24.391367
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-05 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"It’s too late, America",Thomas Cangelosi,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/05/its-too-late-america/,"Once we lost our collective reason to a demagogue peddling lies, we also lost our republic.","It’s too late, America. Indeed, it’s been too late for some time. Once we lost our collective reason to a demagogue peddling lies, we also lost our republic. Now we have a dictator successfully playing upon our fears, anger, prejudices, and hatred to undermine our Constitution and the rule of law.
Our widening belief in conspiracy theories, misinformation, blatant lies, and propaganda amounts to a regression to The Puritan Age when colonialists burned innocent victims as “witches,” based on “spectral evidence.”  It was our Founding Fathers’ intent to leave such nonsense behind and to establish a new nation on the foundation of reason, fact, science, law, and truth.  But it’s clear that a majority of Americans either do not know, or do not care about the difference between reality and propaganda, between truth and lies.  And now it’s too late.
How can reasonable people accept without any credible evidence that the 2020 election was rigged against Donald Trump?  Who believes that Ukraine “should’ve never “started the war with Russia?”  Who cannot distinguish peaceful protest from violent insurrection?  Evidently, American reality these days is whatever the President dictates even when he makes decisions, not with his reason but with his self-inflated “gut.”
Perhaps it was already too late for the American Republic when Trump stacked a conservative Supreme Court, filched Congress’ power of the purse, and issued illegal Executive Orders to send mask-wearing ICE agents to arrest and deport illegal immigrants (our present day “witches,”) without due process under the law.
And it was too late when Trump appointed an administration of yes men and women based not on “merit” but on blatant political patronage and personal sycophancy.
It was  too late when people voted for him to be the people’s “retribution,” because once elected, he weaponized the Department of Justice to prosecute his political “enemies; used the FCC to stifle the free speech of comedians that ruffled his orange feathers, and claimed that negative media coverage of him is “illegal” and not free speech.
Maybe it was even too late before January 6 when President Trump committed an act of treason by falsely proclaiming without any evidence that a fair and legal election had been rigged; by inciting an angry mob to attack the Capitol, threaten the life of the Vice-President, and prevent the peaceful transfer of legitimate power; and then got away with it.
All politics aside, we have collectively accepted or tolerated the reality Trump has dictated to us, despite all facts, reason, laws and science to the contrary.  In a dictatorship reality is whatever the ruler says it is.  And dictating reality precedes dictating everything else.
If he says media coverage critical of him is illegal, then free speech will be stifled. If he lies that Portland, Oregon is “war ravaged,” then sending federal troops to restore order is justified.  If the dictator says James Comey is “a bad man” then the Justice Department may illegally prosecute him, just like in Puritan, Salem.  And if the President’s charlatan Director of Human Health Services says vaccines are dangerous, then we place our children’s health in his incompetent hands.
It’s evident the American public suffers either from a grand delusion or an angry defiance of reason.  What but a witch hunt can explain how so many Americans accept without any credible evidence that illegal immigrants are stealing American jobs by working in the fields or in restaurant kitchens where Americans refuse to work?
And what but a witch hunt can explain how Americans believe without any evidence that Mexican migrants were released from “insane asylums” or are “rapists,” or that Haitian immigrants are eating dogs in Ohio?  Remember the crowds chanting for then presidential candidate Donald Trump to “Build a Wall” to prevent the tired, poor, “huddled masses yearning to breathe free,” from accepting America’s promised refuge from tyranny?  Make America Hate Again would be a more appropriate slogan.
So, along with our lost reason, we have also lost both our principles and our moral compass.  Indeed, after Trump cut USAID falsely claiming its funding “has little to show since the end of the Cold War,” the Lancet medical journal estimates the agency had saved over 90 million lives during the last two decades, and that if the cuts stand, an estimated it 14 million may needlessly die by 2030.  And rather than defending our democratic Ukraine ally, Trump waits for his friend, Russian dictator Putin, to bring another democracy to its knees.
Presently, I’m wondering how many Americans will believe Trump’s false claim that the government was shut down because he wouldn’t agree to let Democrats “give massive amounts of money, hundreds of millions of dollars, to illegal aliens for their health care”?
Yes, it’s too late for American democracy.  The political right uses it power to support him, and the political left has no power to stop him.  Of course, the American masses might come to their senses and take to the streets in protest.  But that will only invite Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act and declare martial law, the final nail in our republic’s coffin.
In his cautionary novel, “It Can’t Happen Here,” Sinclair Lewis warned America about the signs of fascism in the world and at home.  Sadly, it not only can happen here; it already has happened.  Worse: we, the people, have let it happen.

Results […],"In the 26th Legislative District, Democratic state Sen. Deb Krishnadasan, left, is running to keep her seat, and facing a challenge from Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier, right. (Photos courtesy of campaigns)Democratic state Sen. Deb Krishnadasan was holding off Republican Rep. Michelle Caldier on Tuesday in an expensive battle cast as a bellwether of the political mood in Washington.
Krishnadasan led Caldier by a comfortable margin of 52.7% to 47.3% in a contest that drew nearly $4 million in spending by candidates and outside groups. Results will be updated as more votes are tallied.
The winner will represent the 26th Legislative District that spans parts of Pierce and Kitsap counties and includes Bremerton, Port Orchard, Purdy and Gig Harbor. It is one of Washington’s few swing districts where residents are represented by lawmakers from both parties.
The early results suggest Trump continues to drag down Republican candidates in suburban areas, and that progressives are in no mood to cede ground they’ve secured at the state level.
Krishnadasan was winning handily in both counties on Tuesday, unlike the August primary, where she trailed on election night and then moved ahead in later counts. 
“We are encouraged by tonight’s results but know there are many ballots left to count,” Krishnadasan said in a statement. “We are optimistic that our campaign has beaten back one of the most expensive onslaughts of corporate-funded attack ads in state history.”
As of Tuesday, candidates had collectively spent about $1.4 million in the race, with outside groups accounting for another $2.6 million.
If Tuesday’s results hold, it will be a blow to Republicans who viewed this contest as their best chance this year to chip away at Democrats’ 30-19 seat advantage in the state Senate.
That’s because Krishnadasan, a former school board director, was making her case to voters for the first time as a lawmaker, against Caldier, who had won six straight House races in the district.
And this was the first major election since the Democratic-controlled Legislature approved billions of dollars in new business taxes and a 6-cent increase in the state’s gas tax, along with controversial laws such as a cap on rent increases, unemployment benefits for striking workers and requiring a state-issued permit to buy a gun. 
Caldier campaigned on the idea that Democrats overreached and thinning their ranks in the Senate would be the best means of preventing another round of taxes in 2026.
But it appears she may not be able to overcome constant attacks from pro-Krishnadasan forces associating her with President Donald Trump, his policies or the MAGA movement.
“Initial results are not what we wanted, but we will wait to see if the trend reverses over the coming days. We will closely monitor returns and continue to work on ballot rehab to ensure all votes are counted,” said state Sen. Drew MacEwen, R-Shelton, who is the chair of the Senate Republican Campaign Caucus and serves as deputy leader of the Republican caucus.
Krishnadasan, who served six years on the Peninsula School District Board of Directors, was appointed to her seat after former state senator Emily Randall, a Democrat, was elected to Congress last year.
She voted against her party’s major tax bills, the gas tax, and the two-year state budget while backing the major policy bills. She stressed fiscal conservatism and trumpeted a desire to be a change agent in her caucus. She didn’t play the Trump card herself but benefited from the efforts of pro-Democrat forces that did in attacking Caldier.
Caldier won a seat in the House in 2014 and has been reelected five times, typically garnering votes from Democrats and independents.
But Krishnadasan won the August primary by 1,158 votes, which surprised Caldier. The Republican lawmaker attributed this to a low turnout and widespread frustration with the president among those who did vote. 
Caldier sought to tie Krishnadasan with the massive tax hikes and expansive social policies, but was hard-pressed to make her case amid an onslaught of mailers and ads from New Direction PAC labeling her an “extremist” and pairing her with Trump. 
The political committee, which supports incumbent and progressive Democrats, is funded largely by the Democratic caucuses of the House and Senate, the Service Employees International Union, and the Washington Education Association, which is the state’s largest union representing public school employees.
Then, in the campaign’s final days, this same group pivoted and attacked Caldier as a Republican In Name Only, or RINO, in a blunt attempt to deter hardline conservative GOP voters from supporting her.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/primary-2025-krishnadasan-caldier-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-05 00:16:31.813883

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.)The Republican author of a bill that seeks to distinguish treatment for an ectopic pregnancy and other medical conditions from abortion said her bill was a reaction to Republicans struggling on the issue during elections and that she wants to ban abortion from conception.  
Rep. Joy Goeben (R-Hobart) and Sen. Andre Jacque (R-New Franken) introduced the bill in September and it will receive a public hearing on Wednesday in the Senate Licensing, Regulatory Reform, State and Federal Affairs committee. 
The authors have framed the bill as one to help clarify Wisconsin’s laws surrounding abortion by redefining certain medical procedures as not abortions.
At a September town hall posted to YouTube, hosted by the Wisconsin Conservative Coalition (WCC), a nonpartisan association of three conservative groups from the northeast part of the state, Goeben participated on a panel with Jacque and Reps. Nate Gustafson (R-Omro) and Paul Tittl (R-Manitowoc). 
“It’s very simple,” Goeben said of her bill. “It is taking out the molar pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy — all of these things that we wouldn’t think of that as an abortion, but when there is an election we get killed on that on an emotional stance of, “Oh, this woman was going to die because she couldn’t get her health care,” Goeben said.
During the 2024 elections, Republicans lost 14 legislative seats under Wisconsin’s new voting maps. In many of those races, abortion was a major discussion point for Democratic candidates who criticized their Republican opponents for their positions on the issue. 
More will be at stake in 2026 for Republicans, who will be fighting to hold onto the majorities in the Senate and Assembly that they have held for 15 years. Democrats would need to win an additional five seats in the Assembly and an additional two in the Senate to flip each of those houses in 2026.
According to recent polling by Marquette Law School, abortion policy has declined as a “most important” issue among voters across all partisan groups in 2025 as compared to 2022, although 50% of respondents still said they were “very concerned” and 23% said they were “somewhat concerned” about the issue. 
After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ending federally protected abortion rights, health care providers in Wisconsin worried about criminal penalties under an 1849 law considered a near-total abortion ban denied care to women who faced miscarriage and life-threatening pregnancy complications.
But Goeben called claims that women are restricted from receiving health care under restrictive abortion laws are “an out and out lie.”
Her bill, she said, takes away ammunition from Democrats who criticize abortion bans as harmful to women. “I would love to see our Democrat friends vote against this bill because it is, again, simply defining — these things are not abortion,” Goeben said.
Abortion access in Wisconsin has been in flux since the overturn of Roe v. Wade. For about 15 months, abortion access was effectively eliminated. The state Supreme Court then found in 2023 that the 1849 law no longer applied to abortion since  subsequent laws regulating abortion had been passed after 1849, making abortions up to 20 weeks legal. 
Strict abortion laws have also resulted in high-profile cases in states including Texas and Georgia where women have died preventable deaths because they were denied timely care.
In recent months, access at Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, the state’s largest provider of abortion services, was paused due to federal changes and then restarted about a month later. The upheaval in access has caused confusion among patients and providers as reported by Wisconsin Public Radio.
Some medical experts told the Wisconsin Watch that Goeben’s bill is misleading because it  attempts to distinguish medical procedures that end pregnancy under certain circumstances from abortion, which it defines as not including those circumstances.
Goeben said during the September panel discussion that she hopes the state eventually reverts to banning abortion at conception and told attendees that they could make that possible by helping elect candidates who align with their beliefs on the issue. 
“[The bill], unfortunately, isn’t changing the 20 weeks, which I hope at some point we can go back to conception, which is where life begins,” Goeben said. “You need to get online and educate and you need to vote in primaries for people who are 100% pro-life. We are going to have upcoming elections in safe seats. In those safe, conservative seats, are you getting a candidate who is 100% pro-life and is going to stand for that because there are people who are going to run in those seats who are not.”

Colorado holds coordinated elections in odd-numbered years to elect candidates for certain school boards, municipal offices and other local races. More than 1.2 million ballots had been cast statewide in Tuesday’s election, according to data from the secretary of state’s office.
In Denver — where voters appeared set to approve a $1 billion bond package backed by Mayor Mike Johnston and keep a ban on the sale of flavored tobacco products — candidates backed by teachers unions led races for all four seats up for election on the Denver Public Schools board.

If those results hold, it would represent a major defeat for Denver Families Action, a group with roots in the pro-charter “school reform” movement that reported spending $1 million to influence DPS races this year.
Aurora City Council
Though elections in Colorado’s third-largest city are officially nonpartisan, slates of Republican-affiliated candidates led by Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman, a former GOP member of Congress, have solidified their grip on city politics in recent years. Backed by conservative dark money groups, conservatives had hoped to expand their City Council majority in 2025 — but early results showed Democratic-affiliated candidates leading in races for all five council seats up for election.
As of 9 p.m., with more than 94,000 votes cast citywide, Rob Andrews and Alli Jackson led in the race for two at-large council seats. Both Andrews, president of the nonprofit job-training service CommunityWorks, and Jackson, a social worker, were endorsed by a long list of progressive groups and Democratic elected officials.
The two Democratic-affiliated candidates led their Republican-affiliated opponents, Danielle Jurinsky and Amsalu Kassaw, by a few thousand votes. Jurinsky, first elected to her seat in 2021, gained national notoriety last year when her exaggerated claims of a “complete gang takeover” of Aurora helped draw President Donald Trump to the city for a high-profile 2024 campaign stop. Kassaw is an Ethiopian immigrant who works for The GEO Group, a private prison company that operates the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Aurora.
 Douglas County School Board
In Douglas County, a suburban battleground south of Denver where school board politics have been fractious in recent years, early results showed candidates supported by Democrats poised to sweep all four Board of Education seats up for election this year, ending four years of conservative control.
All four candidates that made up the Community’s Voice, Community’s Choice slate — which emphasized its candidates’ education experience and promised to make the district “accountable to the people, not politics” — led their GOP-endorsed opponents with more than 108,000 ballots counted.

The two special elections Tuesday means the Minnesota Senate will return to a Democratic majority, 34-33.
“This special election win was absolutely crucial for defending Democrats’ majority in one of the most competitive legislative chambers in the country,” said Heather Williams, president of Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, in a statement. “This marks the fourth time this year that Democrats have won majority-deciding special elections in Minnesota, and we’re not slowing down any time soon.”
Hemmingsen-Jaeger was first elected to the Minnesota House in 2022. She has a science background, holding degrees in cell biology, genetics and environmental policy. She’s worked for the departments of Public Safety and Human Services.
Holmstrom is a small business owner from Buffalo and a Wright County GOP volunteer. On his campaign site, Holmstrom said he’s had years of “pro-life activism” and committed to “defending girls’ sports and standing with parents as the primary decision-makers in their children’s education.”

After the first round of voting, unofficial election results show Mayor Jacob Frey had about 42% of the votes, with state Sen. Omar Fateh winning 32%, DeWayne Davis about 14% and Jazz Hampton about 10%.
In the next tabulation, candidates with the fewest votes are eliminated; their voters’ second choices will then be apportioned. This process continues until a candidate has a majority. Tabulation will resume Wednesday morning.
Frey is seeking a third term, and pitching stability after overseeing falling crime rates and relatively low rent increases compared to other large cities.
University of Minnesota student Bailey Taylor, a global political science major and Dinkytown resident, said Tuesday he ranked Frey first on his ballot because of the mayor’s approach to crime. Taylor, a dual citizen of the U.S. and the United Kingdom, said he hates that people can’t enjoy his home city of London because of crime, and he doesn’t want to see the same fate befall Minneapolis. 
“I can’t go out at nighttime here because it’s just so unsafe,” Taylor said. “I hate having to confine myself to my own apartment.”
Fateh has promised to bring a democratic-socialist agenda to a city where business interests have long held sway, promising an income tax on the wealthiest residents and rent control.
At Bryant Square Park in Uptown Minneapolis, Madeline Schwabe, 26, a nurse at M Health Fairview, said Tuesday that her health insurance costs have gone up in the past year and voted for Fateh — without ranking other candidates — in the hopes of improving “affordability.”
“It all ties into big businesses, CEOs with a lot of money, not trickling down to the people that are actually in the hospital working,” Schwabe said.
Minneapolis faces fiscal challenges due to rising costs and downtown office vacancies, which increased property taxes on residents, in some cases steeply.
Frey has stood steadfastly behind Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara in a city still steeped in the trauma of the police murder of George Floyd and its aftermath, while Fateh hasn’t committed to reappointing O’Hara and has charged that MPD reform isn’t happening quickly enough.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CityHall-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-04 23:56:20.344774

(Photo by Amanda Brown for New Jersey Monitor)EAST BRUNSWICK — After voters gave a resounding victory to Democrat Mikie Sherrill in the New Jersey governor’s race Tuesday, Sherrill celebrated her win with hundreds of supporters, vowing to fight back against federal policies that have put New Jersey and other Democratic states in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump’s administration.
Sherrill, a four-term congresswoman and former federal prosecutor, took the stage in a sprawling ballroom at the Hilton East Brunswick Hotel around 10 p.m. as supporters erupted in cheers of “Mikie! Mikie! Mikie!” She told the jubilant crowd that her Republican rival, Jack Ciattarelli, had just called to concede the race. As of 11 p.m., the Associated Press reported she’d won 56% of the vote to his 43%.
After pointing to the Trump administration’s moves to cut federal food assistance to 42 million Americans, halt federal subsidies for Obamacare, and cancel the Gateway tunnel project, Sherrill vowed to “fight for a different future in New Jersey.”
“Governors have never mattered more!” she said. “In this state, I am determined to build prosperity for all of our citizens.”
She worked throughout her campaign to nationalize the race and paint it as a choice between democracy and the MAGA movement, often reminding voters that Trump endorsed Ciattarelli. She echoed that Tuesday night, saying New Jersey residents “take oaths to the Constitution, not a king.”
“With this vote, you guys just screamed from the rooftops, and people around the country have heard you,” she said.
She noted the divisiveness of the campaign and politics more broadly but vowed to govern without grudges.
“I know these are tough times. I know not everyone voted for me,” she said. “But I’m working for everyone. Every single one of you. When we all do better, we all do better. So tomorrow begins a new day.”

Many of the Democratic members of New Jersey’s congressional delegation joined supporters at Sherrill’s party, including Reps. Herb Conaway, LaMonica McIver, Rob Menendez, and Frank Pallone, as well as various state officials, including Gov. Phil Murphy.
Once polls closed at 8 p.m., a string of union leaders and politicians took the stage to jazz up a crowd that was already primed to party after the Virginia governor’s race was called for Democrat Abigail Spanberger.
“It won’t be long now!” Sen. Cory Booker shouted from the stage at 9 p.m. “A lot of talk this last year or so. After all that has been said and done, New Jersey has come together! And tonight the whole nation will hear us roar!”
Deafening cheers erupted after the AP called the race for Sherrill at 9:23 p.m.
Sherrill’s win bucks a six-decade trend that has seen no party hold the New Jersey governor’s seat for more than two consecutive terms. She was part of a national Democratic sweep Tuesday, with Spanberger’s victory and Zohran Mamdani snagging a win in the New York City mayor’s race.
“Blue is back!” LeRoy Jones, chair of the New Jersey Democratic Party, yelled from the Sherrill stage. “New Jersey said no to MAGA and yes to democracy!”
He added: “Now we can see the sunshine! And the sunshine is great on the future of the Democratic party!”
The Rev. Dale Caldwell, Sherrill’s pick to become lieutenant governor, had his own cheering section too. His daughter Ashley bragged onstage about her father, while his longtime friend Benjamin Morton watched proudly from the crowd.
Morton, a lawyer, couldn’t vote for Sherrill and Caldwell because he lives in Maryland, but he watched the race from afar and predicted a resounding Democratic win even before the polls closed, resorting to a sports metaphor in line with his brief pre-law career as a former professional basketball player in Europe.
“Generally, the team that’s leading throughout the entire game doesn’t lose in the fourth quarter,” Morton said. “I don’t see any three-point shots or last-minute turnovers here. I think they can squeak it out. Of course, there’s upsets. There’s upsets all the time in sports and in politics. Hopefully there’s no upsets.”
Sherrill will replace Murphy, a term-limited Democrat who has led the Garden State since 2018. Her four-year term will begin in mid-January.
She will become New Jersey’s second female governor at a time when the state is bitterly at odds with the Trump administration, with the Garden State a lead plaintiff or party to 40 lawsuits against the federal government.
Her supporters said Sherrill’s win reflects that dissatisfaction with policies coming out of the White House and Republican-controlled Congress.
“We are seeing a rejection of Trump’s economic policies, and I think in sync with that, Democrats were really able to home in on the affordability message. She had a very clear, strong message on affordability, which for working-class folks is really important,” said Anna-Marta Visky, a Monmouth County voter and union leader.

County voters turned down a referendum that would have shifted their school board from an elected to an appointed system. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Northumberland County’s school board will remain an elected body after 62% of voters on Tuesday opposed a measure that called for converting the board to members appointed by the Board of Supervisors.
More than 1,200 registered voters in the county petitioned the court for the ability to change how the school board is determined following claims that the board had financially mismanaged school finances. Last month, the Virginia State Police told the Mercury that the VSP Bureau of Criminal Investigation and Office of the Northumberland County Commonwealth’s Attorney were conducting an “inquiry,” or preliminary review gathering and assessing information to determine if further action is warranted.
In the contest for Board of Supervisors District 2 seat, Keith Harris beat out incumbent and board chair Robert Haynie with 61% of the vote on Tuesday. 
Harris, who said he was motivated to run for office by the events surrounding the school board, told the Mercury he was still undecided about the school board option leading up to election day. However, he said looking ahead, the boards must work together to improve the county. 
“If you’re not working together for the betterment of our students, it’s a lost cause, and no matter if it’s elected, no matter if it’s appointed, you have to have a relationship,” Harris said. “You have to be able to talk to each other and work these situations out, and hopefully we’re in the right direction to do that now.”
Haynie, the incumbent, said in anticipation of the results, he would accept the decision by voters on the referendum.
“Whether they vote for it or against it, I’m going to respect the opinion of the voters of Northumberland County because that’s what’s important to me,” Haynie said. “I want the voter here to be satisfied with what is going on.”
Haynie did not directly say whether he supporteds the referendum or not. Instead, he said, after investigations and multiple efforts to meet with the school board, which requests funding from the supervisors, he wouldn’t want to go through it again.
“It’s been an uphill battle,” Haynie said. “We’ve tried to have meetings with the school board, but then they have refused to have meetings with us. So it’s been an uphill battle all the way through. So I wouldn’t want to have to go back through it again.”",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6841-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-04 23:17:05.302004

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Democrats managed to increase their majority in the Virginia House of Delegates, moving from 51 to 64 seats (with one race still undecided as of 11 p.m.) as voters turned out Tuesday in a pivotal election for control of the chamber. The win came amid a backdrop of fierce competition across suburban and exurban battlegrounds, with both parties viewing the outcome as a bellwether for 2026 and beyond.
Despite heavy Republican spending and Youngkin’s late push to recapture momentum, Democrats successfully defended vulnerable incumbents and flipped several key districts in vote-rich regions around Richmond, Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads.
Turnout surged in several suburban swing areas, reflecting continued polarization over national issues like abortion and democracy as well as local concerns over housing, health care and school funding. 
Democratic leaders credited what they described as a disciplined, issue-focused campaign that emphasized protecting abortion access and investing in public services, while Republicans leaned on messages about parental rights, public safety and economic management.
The GOP entered the cycle hoping to regain the majority of the 100-body member that it lost in 2023, but even with competitive candidates their gains fell short. The chamber’s new balance  underscores Virginia’s shift toward Democratic strength in its population centers, even as Republicans maintain deep support in rural regions. 
Below is a roundup of results from some of the most competitive House of Delegates races this cycle.
 House District 75

In a closely watched rematch for Virginia’s 75th House District, Democrat Lindsey Dougherty defeated Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, by a margin of 52.5-47.3%, flipping one of the state’s most competitive suburban seats.
Dougherty, a senior research administrator who centered her campaign on expanding mental health services, improving public schools and tackling affordability issues, capitalized on shifting suburban dynamics to unseat the two-term incumbent.
Coyner, a former Chesterfield County School Board member first elected to the legislature in 2019, had emphasized her bipartisan record on education, housing, and budget policy in an effort to hold the district. She also gained attention this cycle for her role in a scandal involving Democratic AG nominee Jay Jones’s violent text messages.
Both campaigns invested heavily in the race, which drew statewide attention as a bellwether for suburban trends in the Richmond region and a key test of Democrats’ effort to expand their House majority.
 House District 71

In the rematch for House District 71, Democrat Jessica Anderson defeated Del. Amanda Batten, R-James City County, by 52.7-47.2% in a closely fought race defined by rapid suburban growth, a tourism-driven economy and strong voter turnout.
The district — spanning the historic city of Williamsburg, established James City County neighborhoods, and the fast-developing exurbs of New Kent — became a focal point for debates over housing affordability, school capacity and worsening traffic along I-64.
Anderson, a former educator and community advocate, built her campaign around managing growth responsibly, investing in public education, and addressing rising living costs. Batten, who has represented the district since 2019, emphasized her legislative experience and work on infrastructure and budget issues while appealing to moderates uneasy about overdevelopment. 
Anderson’s win flipped one of eastern Virginia’s most competitive suburban seats and reflected shifting voter sentiment in communities grappling with change and expansion.
 House District 41

In another closely watched rematch for House District 41, Democrat Lily Franklin defeated Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery, by a margin of 51.1%-48.7% in a race defined by heavy spending and one of the tightest margins of the cycle.
The district, encompassing the college town of Blacksburg and nearby communities in Montgomery and Roanoke counties, remains one of Virginia’s most competitive, balancing youthful, renter-heavy areas with more rural and suburban precincts.
Franklin, who focused her campaign on housing affordability, reproductive rights and workforce training, benefited from strong turnout around Virginia Tech and neighboring suburbs. 
Obenshain, who had touted his work on passenger rail expansion and infrastructure funding, struggled to hold onto the swing district amid demographic and political shifts.
Franklin’s victory flips a key seat in Southwest Virginia and highlights the region’s growing political volatility heading into future legislative contests.
 House District 82

Democrat Kimberly Pope Adams defeated Del. Kim Taylor, R-Petersburg, by 53.6%–46.2% in a hard-fought rematch for House District 82 — a contest that once again lived up to its “Kim vs. Kim” billing.
The district, centered on Petersburg and parts of Chesterfield, Dinwiddie and Prince George counties, was widely viewed as pivotal to determining control of the House. 
Adams, a former state employee and educator, focused her campaign on expanding health care access, improving public schools and safeguarding abortion rights.
Taylor, who first won the seat in 2021 and narrowly held it by 53 votes in 2023, ran on economic growth, job creation and support for law enforcement. 
Both candidates drew significant attention and resources from their parties, underscoring the district’s importance as one of the state’s most competitive. Adams’ victory delivers Democrats a key pickup in Southside Virginia and strengthens their hold on the House majority.
 House District 73

Democrat Leslie Mehta defeated Del. Mark Earley, R-Chesterfield, by 51.5%–48.3% in a closely contested race for House District 73, flipping the Chesterfield County–based seat after one of the region’s most competitive campaigns.
The contest highlighted the shifting political dynamics of Richmond’s fast-growing suburbs, where concerns over housing costs, traffic and school funding have increasingly shaped voter priorities.
Mehta, a civil rights attorney and nonprofit leader, campaigned on expanding access to health care, protecting abortion rights and improving affordability for working families.
Earley, who sought a second term, emphasized public safety, fiscal restraint, and infrastructure investment.
Both candidates drew significant outside attention and spending as the race became a bellwether for suburban trends statewide. Mehta’s victory marks a key Democratic pickup in a district long seen as a barometer of central Virginia’s political realignment.
 House District 97

Del. Michael Feggans, the Democratic incumbent in House District 97, defeated former Republican delegate Tim  Anderson by 57 –42.8% in a pivotal contest centered in coastal Virginia Beach.
The district had flipped to Democratic control just two years earlier and was seen as a barometer for which party would dominate the chamber. Voters in the district, where more than half supported Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race, wrestled with issues including coastal flooding, military and veteran concerns and clean-energy policy.
Feggans, a 20-year Air Force veteran, made veteran families, resilience funding and small-business support the core of his campaign, while Anderson campaigned on tax relief and veteran retirement benefits. 
The outcome secures a key Democratic pickup in one of Virginia’s most closely watched swing seats.
 House District 21

Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, secured his reelection in the race for Virginia’s House District 21, defeating Republican Gregory Lee Gorham by a margin of 58.1%–41.6%. 
The contest, anchored in Prince William County, largely revolved around the rapid expansion of data centers — from questions about massive energy demands and high-voltage transmission lines to concerns over water usage and local land-use impacts.
Thomas, a veteran and commercial-real-estate attorney focused on housing issues, championed clearer oversight and transparency around the booming industry, sponsoring legislation aimed at tracking noise, water and energy forecasts. 
Gorham, a retired IT professional and longtime local Republican activist, argued that Thomas’ plans didn’t go far enough, pushing for harder lines on tax incentives and stronger local control over data-center zoning. The election’s outcome reaffirms Thomas’ hold in this key Northern Virginia district as the sector’s influence grows statewide.
 House District 22

Democrat Elizabeth Guzman defeated Del. Ian Lovejoy, R-Prince William, by a margin of 54.5 –45.3% in the race for Virginia’s House District 22, flipping the seat after a campaign centered on data centers, rising living costs and the region’s rapid growth.
Guzman, a former delegate and social worker, focused on strengthening consumer protections, expanding workforce training, and tightening oversight of the data-center industry that has reshaped parts of Northern Virginia’s landscape and strained local infrastructure. 
Lovejoy, a former Manassas City councilman, emphasized responsible growth, grid reliability and easing regulatory burdens to support business investment.
The district, covering southwestern Prince William County, drew major attention as one of the year’s most competitive contests. Guzman’s win delivers Democrats a key pickup in Northern Virginia and underscores growing voter concern over development pressures and affordability in the fast-changing suburbs of the Washington, D.C., metro area.
 House District 89

Democrat Kacey Carnegie won the open race for House District 89, defeating Republican Mike Lamonea by 54.2 –45.4 % in one of the most competitive contests of the year.
The Chesapeake-based district, which has swung between parties in recent cycles, was left open after Republican Del. Baxter Ennis declined to seek reelection. 
Carnegie, an attorney inspired by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s legacy, ran on raising the minimum wage, tackling rising housing costs and investing in public education. She argued that working Virginians deserve a fair chance to afford living in the communities they serve.
Lamonea, a Chesapeake School Board member and former ICE agent, campaigned on cutting grocery and car taxes, backing law enforcement, and ensuring parents’ voices in education. 
Both candidates made affordability central to their platforms, but Carnegie’s message of economic fairness and investment in schools resonated with suburban voters. Her win delivered Democrats a key pickup.
 House District 86

Democrat Virgil G. Thornton Sr. defeated Del. A.C. Cordoza, R-Hampton, by a margin of 53.4–46.4% in Virginia’s House District 86, flipping a seat that has shifted from reliably Republican territory to one of the cycle’s most contested battlegrounds.
Thornton, a former educator and community advocate, centered his campaign on expanding economic opportunity, protecting reproductive rights and increasing access to workforce training programs. 
Cordoza, who was first elected in 2021, ran on defending gun rights, strengthening K-12 schools and growing job pipelines tied to the region’s military and maritime industries.
The race highlighted how demographic change and rising political engagement are reshaping coastal suburbs stretching across Hampton, York County and Poquoson. Thornton’s win delivers Democrats a key pickup in a region long dominated by the GOP.

Unofficial results showed Republican incumbents falling to Democrats in Ansonia, Stratford and Milford, while the outcomes of other races were unresolved as votes cast in sealed envelopes during early voting were opened and counted.
In New Britain, a convincing win by Democratic state Rep. Bobby Sanchez underscored that the magic sauce of Mayor Erin Stewart, a Republican who thrived for 12 years in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly 3-1, was not transferrable to her chosen successor, Sharon Beloin-Saveedra.

“Many of the Democrats who voted for Erin came home,” Sanchez said.
In Norwich, an open seat and strong turnout helped Singh Swarnjit win election as the first mayor of the Sikh faith in Connecticut. He succeeds Republican Peter Nystrom, who had overcome a 2-1 Democratic edge in previous cycles. 
Singh, a two-time city councilman, drew support from the state’s prominent Democrats, including Gov. Ned Lamont, Attorney General William Tong, Comptroller Sean Scanlon and Treasurer Erick Russell.
“This obviously is a key contest,” said U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, as he campaigned with Singh at an early afternoon campaign stop. “You need to have leadership like Swanjit to make sure that this thing really stays on track.”

National issues intruded in the race, including an exchange in a recent debate over the pursuit of undocumented immigrants by the Trump administration. But, Singh said, his campaign ultimately succeeded because it focused on the issues that mattered to voters. 
“I talked about what we need in Norwich. That’s where my campaign was,” he said. “I feel good about that.” 
Norwich was one of several places where Democrats used animus towards Trump and his insistence that SNAP food benefits would not be fully restored in defiance of two court orders in mailings and text messages aimed at turning out the elements of the Democratic base attuned only to presidential politics.
“There’s no doubt about it: Trump motivates Democrats to come out,” said Mike Farina, a Democratic consultant.
In Westport, a wealthy Fairfield County town that also has more than a 2-1 Democratic advantage, Democrat Kevin Christie was elected first selectman, becoming the first Black candidate to win the seat. He succeeds Republican Jen Tooker. Democrat Josh Brooks won in Branford, another Democratic gain.
Voters went to the polls in all but one of the state’s 169 cities and towns. Union, a rural community off I-84 near the Massachusetts border, is the last town to hold municipal contests in May. There were contests for mayor or first selectman in 122 communities, though 45 candidates were unopposed.
With no contested races in the state’s largest cities, the focus Tuesday was on smaller cities like New Britain, Norwich, Norwalk and others.
Of the five largest cities, Stamford and New Haven were the only ones with mayoral contests: Stamford Mayor Caroline Simmons and New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker, both Democrats, had uneventful reelections.
Democrats also retained control of city halls in Norwalk and Hamden, winning open seats.
In Norwalk, Democrat Barbara Smyth beat Republican Vinny Scicchitano to succeed Harry Rilling, whose election 12 years ago solidified the Democratic hold over city hall. Adam Sendroff, who convincingly won a five-way Democratic primary in September, won a four-way race for mayor in Hamden.

By 9:20 p.m., with all six Madison County precincts and 18 Hinds County precincts in the district unofficially tallied, Canton municipal judge Kamesha Mumford and attorney Letitia Johnson were in the lead with 39% and 28% of the vote, respectively.
The unofficial results show nearly 9,500 people in the district voted.
If no candidate receives 50% plus one vote after the complete official count, including absentees and affidavit ballots, a runoff election will be held Dec. 2 to determine the new lawmaker for Senate District 26.
Physician Coleman Boyd, the race’s conservative candidate, was in third with nearly 16% of the vote after a strong showing in the district’s Madison County precincts.
The race saw seven candidates – including a chemist, retired educator, businesswoman and bishop — most of whom told Mississippi Today during their campaigns that they viewed the district as ripe for economic development but in sore need of infrastructure improvements and better-funded schools.

Tuesday marked a historic Election Day in Mississippi. Federal judges last year determined the Legislature had diluted the state’s Black vote with its 2022 redistricting and ordered 14 special elections. Seven districts across the state saw contested races Tuesday, giving Democrats a unique opportunity to disrupt the Republican party’s two-thirds supermajority.
But the race for the District 26 seat, historically held by a Democrat elected primarily by Jackson voters, was not one of those court-ordered elections. 
In fact, residents in Jackson and some rural parts of Hinds and Madison Counties who voted in the race didn’t have parties to choose from, as the special election was nonpartisan, meaning all candidates appeared on the ballot together. The District 26 race was necessitated when Horhn, who’d held the seat more than 30 years, became mayor of Jackson in July. Two other districts held similar elections to fill vacancies.
U.S. Congressman Bennie Thompson, a Democrat who represents many residents of state Senate District 26 in Washington, endorsed attorney Letitia Johnson for the seat. Horhn did not endorse a candidate or publicly involve himself in the race.

Privately, the mayor offered advice to some candidates on issues facing the district. Johnson said she spoke with Horhn about administrative challenges that the city of Edwards has experienced in drawing down state funds.
“He talked about how he tried to get it corrected, and he talked me through what he would’ve done to get it corrected,” Johnson told Mississippi Today Monday.
Theresa Kennedy, a small business owner from Ridgeland, said she ran into Horhn at neighborhood association meetings in northwest Jackson shortly after he was elected mayor and that he told her to “keep knocking the doors, keep doing what you’re doing.” 
Many candidates said they had knocked on doors across the district in the lead up to Election Day in an effort to boost voter turnout. 
Johnson, wife of NAACP President Derrick Johnson, said she knocked on over 20,000 doors. Mumford said she’d gone out just about every day with a team of canvassers. When she went out to vote at her precinct, arriving at 6:54 a.m., she was the seventh person in line. 
Jermaine Cooley, a chemist who ran for office for the first time, said midday Tuesday he predicted low voter turnout based on his visits to multiple polls throughout the district, but he couldn’t speculate a reason. About half the people Cooley talked to while canvassing knew about the special election, he said, especially due to candidate mailers, but he couldn’t tell if voter awareness translated to the polls. 
“I think that’s a great question that if anyone could really answer that and solve that, they could bottle it and sell it,” he said.

With a strong showing in Madison County, Boyd, a physician from Bolton known for leading protests outside Jackson’s abortion clinic, was a contender early in the night. He unofficially won the district’s six precincts in Madison County, with nearly 34% of the votes.
“I think we’re going to see a surprising result,” he predicted to Mississippi Today the day before the election.
A white Christian conservative, Boyd said he’d been “blown away” by the response he’s received from people of every racial, economic and political background. Earlier this year, Boyd received a pardon from President Donald Trump after he was convicted of federal civil rights conspiracy for blocking the entrance to a Tennessee abortion clinic.
“God created government for very specific purposes and neither one of the parties are fulfilling that,” he said. “Our population has been trained, if I hear ‘Democrat’ I’m supposed to hate it, if I hear ‘Republicans’ I’m supposed to hate it, but I think people are fed up with that.” 
Each part of the district faces unique problems, from the rural towns like Bolton and Edwards to the suburban neighborhoods in northwest Jackson. 
“In Bolton, it’s lights on rural streets, tree limbs, grass,” Johnson said. “In Edwards, there’s questions about annexation and broadening their tax base and other internal issues the city has going on.”
Residents’ concerns even differ inside one of the largest communities in the district, Presidential Hills. 
“It’s huge,” Johnson said of the Jackson subdivision. “Certain parts are worried about crime. Other parts are worried about the streets, cars parked on the side of the road.”
James Pittman, a retired educator and Mississippi Department of Transportation employee, told Mississippi Today he urged prospective voters to read his campaign literature outlining his experience in state government.
But Pittman said he felt like voters made their choice based on whose yard sign they had seen the most. 
“It’s a mystery to me that a lot of the voters would think that one of them is more qualified,” he said of the other candidates. “The only thing they’ve done is spent more money than me and put up more signs.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/04120336/VotingArt14.jpg,,,2025-11-04 22:56:26.626471

(Getty Images)Three state Supreme Court justices were elected to second terms Tuesday, despite efforts by conservative groups to persuade voters to oust them, according to unofficial election results.
Justices Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty and David Wecht, first elected as Democrats in 2015, will continue serving on the commonwealth’s highest court, which hears appeals in cases ranging from capital murder cases to congressional redistricting. 
Their retention to 10-year terms maintains the court’s 5-2 Democratic majority, although Donohue, 72, will be able to serve only three years before reaching the mandatory retirement age for state judges. 
Democratic leaders called the results a victory for judicial independence and a further repudiation of efforts by billionaire political donors to buy court seats.

“Tonight, folks across our commonwealth sent a resounding message by voting to retain all three Supreme Court justices who will continue to defend the rule of law, safeguard our elections, and protect our constitutional rights,” Gov. Josh Shapiro said. “Here in the birthplace of democracy, the good people of Pennsylvania will always stand for freedom.”
Democratic National Committee Chairperson Ken Martin, who campaigned across the state for the justices, said the election was a major win for fair elections, reproductive rights, voting rights, and democracy.
“Tonight, Pennsylvania delivered a message on behalf of the entire country: No matter how rich you are, and no matter how much power you think you might have, our courts are not for sale,” Martin said.
With about half of the vote counted, the votes for each justice stood at about 63% to 37% in favor of retention. Retention vote margins are historically in the range of 60% to 75%.
In other statewide judicial elections, Democrat Brandon Neuman led Republican Maria Batista 56% to 41% in the race for a Superior Court seat and Democrat Stella Tsai led Republican Matt Wolford 57% to 43%. Superior Court Judge Alice Beck Debow and Commonwealth Court Judge Michael Wojcik each held leads in favor of retention.
Since 1968, Pennsylvania has used a system of electing judges initially in contested partisan races and requiring them to stand for retention for subsequent terms. In a retention race, judges face no opponents and voters are asked to decide whether the judge should be retained for another 10-year term.
The retention election for three members of the court created an opening for Republicans to break up the Democratic majority. A non-retention vote for any of the three would have triggered a contested election in 2027.

Groups associated with billionaire donor Jeffrey Yass launched a campaign late last summer to mobilize voters to “term-limit the Pa. Supreme Court” and to associate Donohue, Dougherty and Wecht with unpopular decisions, such as overturning comedian Bill Cosby’s 2018 aggravated indecent assault conviction. 
Another ad said the court was responsible for redrawing congressional districts to help Democrats, while showing a gerrymandered map favored by Republicans that it had actually rejected as unconstitutional.
It’s unclear, until the final campaign finance reports are filed, how much outside groups spent, but the justices and committees supporting them raised at least $14 million.
Nydea Graves, lead democracy coordinator of One Pennsylvania, which promotes progressive, multiracial working class political power, said the vote was a rejection of Yass and the MAGA agenda.
“Voters understood that Pennsylvania needs a court that holds true to the constitution’s promise of equal treatment for all of us. From voting rights to education equity to healthcare to workers’ rights, Pennsylvanians expect the law to be applied fairly, not just in favor of a privileged few,” Graves said.
Donohue, Dougherty and Wecht were originally elected in an unprecedented three-way race. It stemmed from the scandal-driven resignations of two justices and the mandatory retirement of former Chief Justice Ron Castille. 
Justice Joan Orie Melvin resigned in 2013 after she was convicted of using her judicial staff and her sister’s state Senate staff to do campaign work. Justice Seamus McCaffery resigned in 2014 after it was revealed he sent pornographic emails to an agent in the attorney general’s office as former Attorney General Kathleen Kane’s office investigated her predecessor’s handling of the Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse case.

Second-term state Rep. Jon Lancaster, a Republican from Houston, trailed behind his Democratic challenger, Justin Crosby, on Tuesday night in a special general election.
Crosby, a political newcomer, received 2,767 votes to Lancaster’s 2,477, according to incomplete results with all precincts reporting. The race, which includes Chickasaw, Monroe and Clay counties, is one of the areas where a federal court ordered legislators to remake into a majority-Black district.
The final vote tallies can change because local election officials can process absentee ballots for up to five days after the election.
A federal three-judge panel ordered Mississippi to conduct special elections for 14 legislative seats this year because the court determined the Legislature diluted Black voting strength when it redrew state House and Senate districts.
See vote totals below.
Of 14 total elections, seven seats were not contested, either because only one candidate filed to run in the race or because the candidate did not have any opposition in the general election. 
But seven races related to redistricting were contested in the general election: six in the Senate and one in the House.
No matter the outcome of Tuesday’s races, Republicans will still retain control of both chambers of the 174-member Legislature when lawmakers convene in January for their 2026 session. However, national Democratic organizations hoped to end the GOP’s two-thirds supermajority control of the state Senate on Tuesday. 
The federal judicial panel specifically ordered the state to have special elections for House districts in the Chickasaw County area, and Senate districts in the Hattiesburg and DeSoto County areas.
Unrelated to the redistricting lawsuit, voters in parts of the Delta and the Jackson metro area participated in special legislative elections on Tuesday because of incumbents vacating their seats. 
Sen. David Jordan, a Democrat from Greenwood whose district includes portions of Leflore, Panola and Tallahatchie counties, retired over the summer, and six candidates are vying to replace him. 
Seven candidates are looking to fill Jackson Mayor John Horhn’s old seat in Senate District 26 in parts of Hinds and Madison counties. Voters in Bolivar, Coahoma and Sunflower counties are choosing a new representative for House District 26 after Orlando Paden was elected mayor of Clarksdale.  
Voters in Hinds County also will elect a coroner, choosing from a crowded field of six candidates.

(Photo by Jim Obradovich for Iowa Capital Dispatch)The $265 million Des Moines Public Schools bond proposal prevailed in Tuesday’s election, according to unofficial results, overcoming doubts about the measure’s prospects following the arrest of former district superintendent Ian Roberts.
According to unofficial results published by the Polk County Attorney’s Office Tuesday night, the bond issue received support from nearly 74% of voters to just over 26% voting no, with all 72 precincts reporting.
The Des Moines Public Schools’ Reimagining Education Bond was one of the most expensive and highest-profile bond referendums on the ballot in Iowa Tuesday. The measure will fund the school district’s Reimagining Education, Reinvigorating Schools plan, allowing the board of directors to issue up to $265 million aimed at initiatives like updating school buildings and technology, creating “signature schools” focused on specialized topics, and offering all-day preschool for 4-year-olds and decreasing class sizes.
Bond referendums are often difficult measures to pass, with some voters reluctant to approve tax increases. These questions also require a higher threshold for approval — 60% of voters must approve the bond question. According to data shared at a Des Moines school board meeting in July, approving the bond will increase property tax costs for a home valued at $200,000 by roughly $188 each year over the course of 20 years.
The DMPS proposal became even more controversial after Roberts’ immigration arrest in September. In the wake of his detainment by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, federal officials released information confirming he had been given an order of removal by an immigration judge in 2024 and had a previous criminal history.
The Associated Press also reported Roberts had asked the Des Moines school board for emergency approval of $116,000 in contracts three months after he was hired, for “culturally responsive coaching” that included a contract with a company he was affiliated with, Lively Paradox. While school finance officials flagged these contracts as a potential conflict of interest, Lively Paradox was later paid $6,476 by DMPS for consulting and travel expenses that were not brought up as a conflict of interest by board or district staff.
Iowa Auditor Rob Sand, who is running as a Democratic candidate for governor in 2026, said in October he believed the contract issue, as well as other subjects in Roberts’ situation, show there are legitimate concerns about spending and other issues at DMPS that warrant investigation. Sand confirmed the Auditor of State’s office had received a qualifying request in October to reaudit DMPS.
As questions surfaced about DMPS spending practices after Roberts’ arrest, DMPS and school board officials announced in October the creation of the Reimagining Education Bond Oversight Committee — an independent, third-party body — to review financial reports and project updates to ensure money spent through the bond matches with the language before voters on the Nov. 4 ballot.
“Many people recognize the need for this bond, but they want assurances the investment will be well managed, and this committee is an important step to give voters confidence,” Matt Smith, DMPS interim superintendent said in a statement.
DMPS officials and supporters argued the measure is needed to address current problems and meet needs in Iowa’s largest school district.
Michele Wilkie, chair of the Taxpayers Association of Central Iowa, which endorsed the bond initiative, said in a news release the endorsement “reflects confidence in the district’s strategic approach to addressing critical infrastructure needs, enhancing educational environments, and responsibly managing taxpayer resources.”
Throughout the state, there were more than 55 bond proposals on Iowans’ ballot in the local 2025 elections, with cities, counties, community colleges and schools asking residents in their jurisdictions for approval to fund large projects. The total amount of money up for discussion in the referendums was more than $1.5 billion, according to Iowans for Tax Relief.

The Associated Press called the race in favor of Proposition MM, which would raise $95 million annually for school meals by limiting tax deductions for filers with higher incomes, at 8:25 p.m. With more than 1.1 million votes counted, nearly 64% of voters had cast a ballot in favor of Proposition LL, and 57% voted in favor of Proposition MM.
Both measures were referred to the ballot by the Colorado General Assembly earlier this year. Together, they will shore up funding for Healthy School Meals For All, a state program that provides free breakfast and lunch to all students regardless of their family’s income level.

“Thank you to every voter, volunteer, community partner, and endorsing organization who turned out to pass Propositions LL and MM, ensuring every child in Colorado can continue to get a healthy meal at school,” Joe Kabourek, campaign manager for the Keep Kids Fed Colorado campaign, said in a press release. “Propositions LL and MM will keep kids fed in school, leading to better grades, higher graduation rates, and better outcomes for Colorado students.”
Colorado voters approved a ballot measure to create the program three years ago. It was funded by limiting income tax deductions for filers earning over $300,000 per year. The program’s funding mechanism raised more than expected in the 2023-2024 fiscal year, but its costs also exceeded projections, resulting in a budget gap that rose to roughly $50 million this year.
Proposition LL will allow the state to keep the $12.4 million in excess 2023-2024 revenue that would otherwise be returned to voters under the 1992 state constitutional amendment known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights.
Proposition MM aims to permanently fund the full program by further limiting tax deductions for filers earning over $300,000 a year. About 194,000 Coloradans in that high-income category would pay an average of $486 more in income taxes yearly, according to nonpartisan state fiscal analysts.
Keep Kids Fed Colorado reported $739,200 in contributions since June, mostly from the nonprofit Hunger Free Colorado. The measures were endorsed by a long list of organizations including Children’s Hospital Colorado, Great Education Colorado, Mi Familia Vota, Rocky Mountain Farmers Union and Save the Children Action Network. The measures did not draw an organized opposition campaign.
During a special legislative session in August, Colorado lawmakers tweaked Proposition MM to allow the additional revenue to be spent on broader efforts to reduce food insecurity, once the Healthy School Meals For All program’s costs are covered. That would help the state partially offset the impact — estimated at up to $170 million annually — of reduced funding and higher administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as a result of cuts passed by congressional Republicans in July.
“While we celebrate this victory for Colorado kids and families, we also cannot ignore that, for thousands of Colorado families, this remains a time of deep economic hardship and food insecurity, made worse by USDA’s refusal to provide full funding for SNAP and the devastating cuts to SNAP Congress approved this past summer,” Anya Rose, director of public policy at Hunger Free Colorado, said in a statement.
This is a developing story.

Winsome Earle-Sears for governor, Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, topped conservative talk-show host John Reid in the lieutenant governor’s race, and former state delegate Jay Jones unseated incumbent Attorney General Jason Miyares in a contest clouded by controversy.
Spanberger won with 55 % of the vote to 44.8% for Earle-Sears, while Hashmi prevailed 53.2 % to 46.6 %, and Jones edged Miyares 52.2 % to 47.4 %, according to the Associated Press and unofficial data from the Virginia Department of Elections at 10:10 p.m.
Democrat Abigail Spanberger wins Virginia governor’s race

The Democratic victories delivered a sharp rebuke to Virginia’s Republican establishment, which had controlled the executive branch since Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s election in 2021. After years of narrow statewide races and shifting partisan tides, voters restored full Democratic control of all three statewide offices for the first time since 2017.
Spanberger, a former three-term congresswoman from Henrico County, ran on a message of stability and moderation — emphasizing economic security, reproductive rights and a pragmatic governing style. 
Earle-Sears, a conservative firebrand and the state’s first Black woman lieutenant governor, leaned into cultural themes and parental-rights rhetoric that helped define the GOP’s earlier resurgence. But her alliance with President Donald Trump and friction with members of her own party over abortion and voting rules blunted her crossover appeal.
Hashmi, a state senator from Richmond and the first Muslim woman elected to the General Assembly, cast her campaign as a moral counterpoint to the GOP’s direction under Reid, a Richmond radio host whose campaign mixed populist outrage with anti-establishment flair. 
Reid entered the race under a cloud of controversy after news reports revealed a trove of old Tumblr posts containing inflammatory and racially charged language, prompting Youngkin to publicly call on him to end his campaign in the spring. The episode fractured Republicans just months before the primary elections, as party leaders scrambled to contain the fallout. 
Reid’s decision to later stage a “debate” against an AI-generated version of Hashmi — after she declined to share the stage with him — drew ridicule from Democrats and independents alike, underscoring how much the GOP ticket had veered off message in the final stretch.
And in the attorney general’s race, Jones overcame his own baggage — a storm over offensive text messages he sent in 2022 that surfaced this fall — to narrowly oust Miyares, a Republican who rose to prominence as one of the party’s most aggressive critics of Virginia’s universities and public prosecutors.
 A wave built on economic worries and rights debates

This year’s races unfolded against a backdrop of economic uncertainty and social-policy tension that defined much of the 2025 cycle. Virginia’s exposure to federal employment — more than 140,000 civilian jobs tied directly to Washington — made the state particularly sensitive to federal layoffs and shutdown threats under the Trump administration’s cost-cutting push. 
Spanberger and other Democrats seized on that anxiety, warning that continued federal downsizing could threaten both household stability and the state’s long-term revenue base. In February, Virginia lawmakers scrambled to shield the state’s economy from what they considered a potential federal workforce crisis.
Health-care access, reproductive rights, and Medicaid funding also loomed large. 
Hospital administrators warned that hundreds of thousands of Virginians could lose coverage if federal matching funds were reduced. And when Congress began flirting with another shutdown in September, hospitals braced for the fallout. 
Spanberger, who consistently led in polls through the summer, framed those issues around “basic competence and care.” Even as the race tightened in the final stretch before the election, a VCU survey found Spanberger ahead of Earle-Sears outside the margin of error.
 Controversies and campaign contrasts

The most explosive subplot of this cycle came in the attorney general’s race, when texts from Jones surfaced in early October  in which he appeared to fantasize about violence toward a Republican House speaker and his family. The revelations jolted Virginia’s political world, prompting even some Democrats to question whether he could remain viable.
Republicans hoped the scandal would sink the entire Democratic ticket, with Earle-Sears sharply questioning Spanberger’s support of Jones during the gubernatorial candidates’ only debate. 
But Jones weathered the storm by apologizing repeatedly and pivoting to the same bread-and-butter issues dominating the governor’s race. His debate with Miyares at the University of Richmond underscored the campaign’s stark tone, as both men clashed over accountability and integrity. 
Hashmi’s race against Reid offered its own spectacle. Reid’s late-season stunts — including the “AI debate” — generated viral moments but failed to expand his coalition beyond conservative talk-radio listeners. 
Hashmi stayed on message about reproductive rights and classroom equality, themes that resonated with suburban voters in Richmond and Northern Virginia.
Earle-Sears, meanwhile, struggled to distance herself from Trump’s renewed political shadow and from intra-party feuds that spilled into public view after the spring resignation of GOP lieutenant governor nominee Reid’s predecessor on the ticket. A so-called “unity rally” by the Republican slate in Vienna in July did little to undo the damage.
 Turnout and strategy

Democrats benefited from a late-cycle boost when the Democratic National Committee poured six figures into Virginia’s get-out-the-vote effort, helping blunt GOP enthusiasm and ensuring strong turnout in vote-rich suburbs. 
Republicans invested heavily in Southside and Southwest Virginia but struggled to match Democrats’ ground game in the suburbs — particularly in Henrico, Loudoun and Virginia Beach, where abortion rights and federal job security dominated.
The results put Virginia Democrats back in full control of the state’s top offices for the first time in four years and will potentially reshape the political map ahead of 2026’s congressional midterm contests.
Spanberger’s victory gives Democrats a seasoned executive with national security credentials and bipartisan appeal, while Hashmi’s historic win breaks another glass ceiling in a state where diverse candidates have steadily redefined the political mainstream. And Jones’ comeback — despite his missteps — cements a generational shift within the party’s ranks.
Spanberger’s incoming administration faces immediate tests — from navigating economic fallout from federal job losses and protecting health-care funding to managing the political tension between Northern Virginia’s booming suburbs and rural regions fearful of being left behind. 
For Republicans, Tuesday’s results trigger a reckoning. 
Once buoyed by Youngkin’s 2021 success and Earle-Sears’ barrier-breaking rise, the party now finds itself out of statewide power and searching for a message that resonates beyond its conservative base.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Portland voters supported a question on Tuesday’s ballot to raise the city’s minimum wage to $19 per hour over the next three years. 
The city’s minimum wage currently sits at $15.50 an hour. Under the proposal that passed with 64% of the vote, it will jump to $16.75 per hour in 2026, $17.75 in 2027 and then $19 an hour in 2028. After that, the wage would keep pace with cost of living increases.
Currently, the state’s minimum wage is $14.65, but the Maine Department of Labor announced in September a 45 cent increase that will take effect Jan. 1, 2026.
In 2020, Portland voters approved a referendum question that raised the city’s minimum wage to $15 by 2024. That ordinance, which had an effective date of 2021, can’t be amended for five years except with another referendum. 
Per Maine law and a 2016 citizens referendum, the state is required to make an annual adjustment based on the cost-of-living index for the Northeast Region. However, the cities of Portland and Rockland have had their own minimum wages, which they usually update based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.

(Photo by Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)A $950 million package of infrastructure bonds backed by Denver Mayor Mike Johnston appeared headed for approval by voters in the Mile High City on Tuesday, according to unofficial election results.
The five measures comprising the “Vibrant Denver” bond package, Ballot Issues 2A–2E, received support from large majorities of Denver voters in the first batch of election results released by city elections officials, which tabulated more than 90,000 votes.
Data released by the Colorado secretary of state’s office earlier Tuesday showed that at least 117,189 Denver voters had cast their ballots as of 2 p.m.
A measure to retain the Denver City Council’s 2024 ban on the sale of flavored tobacco products also held a commanding lead, with more than 72% voting to keep the ban in place.

The Vibrant Denver package, the first major bond issue the city has proposed since 2021, asked voters whether to approve five pieces individually: transportation and mobility projects totaling $441 million; parks and recreation projects totaling $175 million; health and human services projects totaling $30 million; city infrastructure and facilities projects totaling $244 million; and housing and shelter projects totaling $59 million.
The first and most expensive of the five measures, Ballot Issue 2A, drew criticism for its inclusion of a combined $139 million for reconstruction of two viaducts near the proposed site of a new Denver Broncos stadium in Burnham Yard, with some council members arguing that other projects were more deserving.
Though Issue 2A led by the smallest margin of any of the bond measures in early results, it still held a nearly 20 percentage point lead, with 59.5% of voters in favor and 40.5% opposed.
A campaign in support of the bond package reported raising over $1.8 million in contributions from a long list of Denver-based businesses, cultural institutions and individual donors, including former MDC Holdings executive Larry Mizel and former DaVita CEO Kent Thiry.
More than 200 individual projects are set to be funded through the Vibrant Denver proposal. A full list is available on the city’s website.
Flavored tobacco ban
Denver City Council voted 11-1 last year to pass a ban on the sale of flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, flavored e-cigarette cartridges and flavored pouches and chews.
Opponents of the ban organized a signature-gathering campaign and collected the 9,400 valid signatures required to place a veto measure, Referendum 310, on the 2025 ballot.
A committee in support of the ban, Denver Kids vs. Big Tobacco, raised more than $5.8 million to encourage a yes vote on Referendum 310, according to campaign finance records. Nearly all of that funding came from billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a longtime benefactor of anti-tobacco causes.
Citizen Power, a committee registered to oppose the ban, received over $652,000 in contributions from donors including the Rocky Mountain Smoke Free Alliance, a vaping industry trade group, as well as tobacco giants Altria and Philip Morris.
Updated results are expected to be released by the Denver Elections Division at 8:30 p.m.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Maine voters have decided to expand the ways to temporarily confiscate firearms from someone deemed a threat, backing a referendum Tuesday to establish a so-called red flag law on top of the state’s existing yellow flag statute.
Question 2 on Tuesday’s ballot asked voters whether they would like the state to adopt an extreme risk protection order that would allow family or household members to directly petition a court to temporarily confiscate someone’s firearms. It passed with 58.7% of voters in support.
Maine now joins twenty-one other states, including four in New England, that already have a red flag law on the books.
The addition of a red flag law does not replace Maine’s existing yellow flag law, which isn’t used anywhere else in the country and allows law enforcement to take guns away from people after a mental health evaluation. The passage of Question 2 means both processes can be used in the state. 
At the polls Tuesday, voters who backed Question 2 had a range of opinions about gun reforms. 
Robin Berry, a Democrat from Oxford, said, “I don’t think machine guns should be allowed in anybody’s house.”  
In between his shifts in emergency service, Isaac Tardif of Oxford also voted in favor of Question 2 because in his field he has personally seen situations where he thinks it would help. 
While he has concerns that some people might take advantage of the ability to remove one’s firearms, he ultimately believes that the potential for harm from gun violence outweighs that. 
A few minutes later, Brandon Yap of Oxford exited the polls and explained why he voted against Question 2. 
“I felt like it was infringing on the Second Amendment,” Yap said.

After the polls closed, about 30 people gathered in Portland to support Maine’s red flag law, including several activists who have worked on the campaign for a year, volunteers and Maine Gun Safety Coalition board members. 
Just before 10 p.m., the room erupted in applause as the onlookers celebrated the win.
“Maine has won. Together, we have done something that we were repeatedly told was impossible,” said Nacole Palmer, executive director of the coalition. “Today, we have taken the safety of our communities into our own hands by finally passing common sense, responsible gun legislation that will save lives and help keep our kids and communities safe.”
Arthur Barnard, a citizen sponsor of the proposal, attended the party to meet some others who are in support of what he described as “common sense legislation.” 
Barnard has been outspoken about the need for stronger gun regulations since his son, Arthur Strout, died in the 2023 Lewiston mass shooting. 
Margaret Groban, a former federal prosecutor and Maine Gun Safety Coalition board member, said the citizen-led initiative “will go a long way to trying to prevent suicide and homicide in the state.”
“It’s a commonsense response to Lewiston and it’s our best way to honor the victims,” she said. 
The effectiveness of Maine’s current yellow flag law was called into question after the October 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston after an independent commission found that it could have been used on the perpetrator, Robert Card II, months before he killed 18 people and injured 13 more. 
During the commission’s investigation, law enforcement reported the yellow flag law was cumbersome, but the statute has been updated in the two years since and law enforcement has received additional training. 
As of early October, the yellow flag law had been used more than 1,100 times. Lt. Michael Johnston of the Maine State Police said 81 of those occurred between 2020, when the law was implemented, and late 2023. More than 1,000 uses occurred in the past two years at a rate of 1.5 per day, he said. 
After the Maine Legislature failed to pass several more restrictive gun safety measures in the wake of the shooting, the Maine Gun Safety Coalition launched the referendum effort and in January delivered more than 80,000 petition signatures in support of the red flag proposal.
Gov. Janet Mills voiced her opposition to the proposal before Tuesday’s election, pointing to the increased use of the yellow flag law as evidence of its effectiveness.

These changes were proposed in Question 1 on Tuesday’s ballot, which failed with just 40.4% of the vote.
The Save Maine Absentee Voting campaign, along with the Maine Democratic Party and other supporting organizations, started gathering at 7 p.m. at Orange Bike Brewing in Portland before results started rolling in. 
Executive Director of the Maine Democratic Party Devon Murphy-Anderson said in the lead up to the election the campaign made more than 400,000 direct voter contact attempts, both door knocking and phone banking.

“Our takeaway is that when we get out there and we talk face to face with voters, we knock the doors, we make the calls, we get back to grassroots organizing and get back to the basics, it shows in voter awareness,” she said.
Murphy-Anderson said the most common concern heard when knocking doors was affordability. She views the Question 1 effort as a distraction from that. 
At the polls Tuesday, Robin Berry of Oxford said she voted against Question 1 because of how it would restrict absentee voting. 
“I’m 70 years old. When I get in a nursing home, I want to be able to vote absentee,” Berry said. “A lot of the elderly can’t get out to vote.” 
Gabby Riggieri, an independent from Oxford, said, “I don’t think we need to make voting any more challenging for anyone. We need to make voting more accessible, not harder for people.”
Many voters who supported Question 1 felt most strongly about the provision to require identification at the polls, including Diann Moseson, an independent from Poland, and Brandon Yap, a Libertarian from Oxford. 
When asked about why she voted yes on Question 1, Julie Ames of Poland said, “Just show an ID – that’s it.”
Campaigns for and against Question 1 saw more spending than the other statewide referendum on the ballot. Most of the money was raised by those who opposed the measure, who collected roughly $1.8 million compared to the $585,000 raised by supporters, according to filings through Oct. 21.
The proposal sought to modify a variety of Maine election laws, such as banning pre-paid return postage for absentee ballots and prohibiting voters from requesting absentee ballots by phone or through family members.
It was opposed by all of Maine’s Democratic elected officials, including Gov. Janet Mills and Secretary of State Shenna Bellows.

RJ May.
John Lastinger led the special GOP primary runoff with more than 52% of the vote as of 9:30 p.m. Tuesday.
With all but one precinct reporting, he was defeating Brian Duncan, a candidate who launched a write-in campaign in October 2024 against May, who had no opposition on the ballot, following news of a federal investigation. May is in jail awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to distributing videos of children being sexually abused.
Lastinger, lead pastor at The Edge church in Springdale, had the backing of Freedom Caucus Rep. Jay Kilmartin of Irmo.
Duncan, of Red Bank, had the backing of the majority House GOP caucus, House Majority Leader Davey Hiott previously told the SC Daily Gazette.
A special election was called after May, a founding leader of the Freedom Caucus, resigned in August ahead of his guilty plea. His sentencing is set for January.
Despite having the support of Kilmartin, Lastinger indicated he may not join the caucus May helped launch. He previously told the Gazette he hasn’t yet decided what caucuses he might join.
On Dec. 23, Lastinger will face Democrat Chuck Hightower to determine who represents the district that covers the town of Lexington and several rural communities to the south. But the district is ruby red, meaning Tuesday’s runoff likely decided May’s successor.

(Photo courtesy of JillDavidson.com)Jill Davidson won the Democratic primary for Providence’s Ward 2 City Council seat in Tuesday’s election, according to unofficial results on the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s website.
The director of development and communications at the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council bested three other opponents to capture 49.1% of the vote for the ward spanning the Blackstone, College Hill and Wayland neighborhoods on the capital city’s East Side. 
David A. Caldwell Jr. was the next top vote-getter with 28.9% of the vote. In third place was Jeffrey L. Levy with 14.3%. In last place was Matt McDermott with 7.7%.
There were 2,697 ballots cast in the special primary, representing about 15% of the 18,044 registered voters eligible to vote in the election. Polls closed at 8 p.m.
Davidson won all three of the ward’s precincts, according to results posted at 9:25 p.m.
The median income in neighborhoods like College Hill and Blackstone are among Providence’s wealthiest. In Blackstone, for instance, the median income in 2021 was $149,329, far higher than the city median of $49,065, according to city data.
Davidson will face Republican Axel Brito, a 21-year old Brown University senior in the Dec. 2 special election. Brito was the only Republican candidate so there was no Republican primary.
The Ward 2 seat was held by Helen Anthony, who resigned in early September, citing a continued need for recovery from injuries she sustained in a 2023 accident. Anthony assumed the Ward 2 post in 2019 and chaired the council’s Committee on Finance. 
Anthony had endorsed Davidson in the race.
McDermott released a statement committing to “enthusiastically supporting” Davidson in the Dec. 2 election.
Working Families Party New England Regional Director Georgia Hollister Isman released a statement praising Davidson:
“Once again voters have shown they want leaders who prove they will deliver wins, while building governing power for working people for the long-term. Jill brought together people from across the district and united Ward 2 behind a campaign that prioritized fully funding public schools, climate resiliency, and making Providence affordable for all of us. These are the issues that Jill will champion at City Hall, and we’re excited for her to get to work.”
Daniel Denvir, the co-chair of Reclaim RI, wrote in a statement that Davidson’s win is “a major victory for the East Side and for all of Providence” and that “voters chose a progressive, independent, proven leader in Jill Davidson over the false narratives and fear mongering of powerful real estate interests.” 
Also Tuesday, Central Falls voters chose four members to fill at-large seats on the city’s nonpartisan school board. The top vote-getter was Carla Melissa Hernandez with 26.5% of the vote followed by Lizsandra Paneto Gullon with 25.1%; Zuhanna Medina with 23.6%; and Erika N. Vallejo Calderon with 11.6%. Candidate Angelo Marin received 9.8% of the vote. There were 31 write-in votes and 932 votes total.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The two mass emergency shelters in Anchorage set up for Western Alaska residents displaced by ex-Typhoon Halong have now closed, state officials said Tuesday, as families move to non-congregate shelters like hotels and other longer term housing. 
The emergency shelter that was set up at the William A. Egan Civic and Convention Center in downtown Anchorage for residents displaced by ex-Typhoon Halong is closed as of Tuesday, state officials said in a statement. The shelter at the Alaska Airlines Center on the campus of the University of Alaska Anchorage closed on Friday. 
The Spenard Recreation Center has opened as a temporary shelter for displaced residents if needed, and will serve as a short term “pass-through location” as they transition to longer term housing, the announcement said. 
“Closing the Egan Center doesn’t signal the end of our shelter support mission or diminish the urgent need to transition more people into non-congregate housing,” said Bryan Fisher, director of the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management in a statement. 
“The state is grateful for the Municipality of Anchorage and Mayor LaFrance’s comprehensive support for the evacuees, and we value our continued partnership. It’s a clear example of how Alaskans always take care of our own,” he said.
The U.S. Postal Service will continue to operate a mail service center at the Egan location until the end of the month, to help evacuees set up new mailing addresses where assistance checks can be mailed. 
A total of 483 people have transitioned from the emergency shelters in Anchorage as of Monday, according to an update by the division. 
On Monday, a disaster assistance center opened in Anchorage, in coordination with the Calista Corporation, to support displaced residents and connect them with services, according to a state announcement. 
The center is located at the Calista Maani Building in Midtown Anchorage, and will provide support for residents registering for individual assistance with state, federal or Red Cross programs. Calista and other partners are also providing career workshops, jobs resources and help to coordinate job opportunities.  
As of Monday, 1,280 people had applied for state individual assistance, according to a state update, and 518 people had applied for federal assistance with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. State officials said both agencies are coordinating to share information and encourage residents to apply for each program.

(Photo by Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]Democrat Mikie Sherrill was elected New Jersey governor on Tuesday, the Associated Press projects, landing a hard-fought victory that many election observers regarded as a rejection President Donald Trump. 
Sherrill, a four-term congresswoman and former federal prosecutor, defeated Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican and retired state assemblyman making his third bid for governor. 
Her win bucks a six-decade trend that has seen no party hold the governor’s seat for more than two consecutive terms. She will replace Gov. Phil Murphy, a term-limited Democrat who has led the Garden State since 2018. 
She will become New Jersey’s second female governor at a time when the state is bitterly at odds with the Trump administration, with the Garden State a lead plaintiff or party to 40 lawsuits against the federal government.
Her win came despite stinging attacks from Ciattarelli that had cast her as a Murphy clone sure to continue policies that have helped drive up costs in the Garden State. 
Sherrill brought in a bevy of big-name politicians to stump at her side, including former President Barack Obama and several Democratic governors and federal lawmakers.
Her four-year term will begin in mid-January. The Rev. Dale Caldwell, her running mate who’s now president of Centenary University in Hackettstown, will be lieutenant governor.
Sherrill, a Montclair mother of four and former Navy helicopter pilot, has represented the 11th Congressional District, which covers parts of Morris, Essex, and Passaic counties, since January 2019. Her elevation to the governor’s mansion will leave that seat up for grabs in 2026.

Photo courtesy of the candidateAt least one Democrat appears to have delivered an upset in Georgia’s off-year special election for the Georgia Public Service Commission, and another Democrat was leading in a second race.
As of 9 p.m., Democrat Alicia Johnson led with about 59% of the vote, according to unofficial results from the Georgia Secretary of State’s website.
Republican incumbent Tim Echols, who was holding a virtual election night party on social media, did not explicitly concede but ended his party early after congratulating both Peter Hubbard, who is running in District 3, and Alicia Johnson on “a well-fought fight.”
“It’s been my pleasure to do this for 15 years on the commission. The numbers have been called. We’re going to come back if anything changes,” Echols said before signing off.
Alicia Johnson in a statement pledged to support energy policy at the PSC that benefits the public, rather than catering to the interests of powerful energy companies. 
“This victory isn’t just mine, it’s ours. It’s for the single mother choosing between groceries and her power bill, the senior trying to keep the lights on, and the young voter who showed up believing that their voice matters,” Johnson said in a press release.
Shortly before 9 p.m., Republican Commissioner Fitz Johnson, who is running against Hubbard, a clean energy advocate, had not conceded.
The Democrats’ campaigns centered on widespread frustration over a series of six rate hikes approved by the all-Republican commission in the last two years, which have increased the average residential household’s bill by about $500 annually.
Georgia Republican Party officials had openly expressed concern over the unique timing of the election, which coincided with local municipal contests that experts said would likely spur higher Democratic mobilization. GOP leadership, including Gov. Brian Kemp, had tried to rally support and warned of a potential Democratic win.  
The PSC races are seen as a potential indicator of statewide voter sentiment, suggesting that a Democratic breakthrough could provide significant momentum for the party’s attempts to regain traction in Georgia heading into an election year when U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff will be fighting for another term and several high-profile contests, like an open race for governor, are on the ballot. 
This year’s PSC special elections represented the first time since 2020 that any of the sitting commissioners have faced voters in a general election. The elections had been delayed by a lawsuit challenging the commission’s at-large voting system. Fitz Johnson, who was appointed to the seat by the governor in 2021, was up for election for the first time as a commissioner.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Headshot-1_WhiteBckgsmaller-1-819x1024.jpg,,,2025-11-04 21:17:03.405162

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said at least three people have died after a United Parcel Service plane crashed after taking off from the Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, creating a large blaze and sending a plume of dark smoke into the air. 
Beshear said during a Tuesday evening press conference alongside local elected officials and Louisville’s fire and police chiefs that he expected the number of fatalities to rise and urged Kentuckians to pray for affected families. He also said there were at least 11 injuries, with those significantly injured being treated at local hospitals. 
“The toughest moments — and I can say it from personal experience — are when you’re wondering whether that person that you know and you care about has survived something like this,” Beshear said.
The Federal Aviation Administration on social media wrote that UPS Flight 2976 crashed around 5:15 p.m. EST after departing from the airport. The plane, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11, was headed to Honolulu. The federal agency said it would investigate the crash along with the National Transportation Safety Board, which would be leading the investigation. 
Beshear said the “main area hit” primarily included two businesses, Kentucky Petroleum Recycling and Grade A Auto Parts. The governor said Grade A Auto Parts, which sells auto parts from used cars,  had located all but two employees yet couldn’t account for other customers potentially on site. 
Beshear said the status of the three crew members on board the plane is not known. He said the plane had approximately 38,000 gallons of fuel when it took off.
The airport is home to the UPS Worldport, the shipping company’s largest package handling facility and delivery hub that employs tens of thousands of people. 
Betsy Ruhe, a Louisville Metro Council member whose district includes the airport, mentioned how many people UPS employs in Kentucky’s largest city including her family and friends. 
“We all know somebody who works at UPS, and they’re all texting their family trying to make sure everyone is safe,” Ruhe said. “My heart goes out to those family and those friends.” 
Louisville emergency responders urged residents north of the airport to follow a shelter-in-place order due to hazardous smoke from the fire created by the crash.

Plainfield residents voted Tuesday against a $600,000 bond to purchase land for new housing development, 15 months after a flood devastated the town’s village core.
The bond would have allowed the town selectboard to borrow the funds to buy 24 acres of land located uphill of the village. The town clerk’s office said the vote was 238-298 against the measure. 
The town applied for a $9.7 million Community Development Block Grant to develop infrastructure on the now-undeveloped land at 68 East Hill Road and 266 Main St., according to the town website. The selectboard planned to sell roughly 40 parcels of land for housing development after building infrastructure like roads and utility hookups. 
Plainfield experienced some flooding in July 2023, but the July 2024 flood was even more damaging for the town of 1,200 residents. Half of an apartment building was swept away by flood waters in 2024. Between the two years, 39 households have applied for federal buyouts, according to a town grant presentation. 
In the wake of the floods, local volunteers formed the East Village Expansion Committee to explore developing land outside of the flood zone. Proponents of the plan said in 2024 that they believe it could help bolster the town’s tax base and relieve the local housing shortage. 
Meanwhile, critics of the idea have objected to the project’s cost or the potential for increased local traffic. They’ve also raised concerns about a possible conflict of interest, since town clerk Bram Towbin co-owns some of the land. The Vermont State Ethics Commission investigated the situation earlier this year and ultimately ruled that the town was in compliance with ethical standards.
The $600,000 bond would have been used only once funding for the rest of the project was fully lined up, according to the expansion committee’s website.

A letter from members of the National Association of Attorneys General said ambiguity in a 2018 federal law allowing farmers to grow low-potency cannabis for hemp products has been exploited to sell synthetic marijuana in gas stations, convenience stores and other businesses without regulation or consistent age controls. 
“Intoxicating hemp-derived THC products have inundated communities throughout our states due to a grievously mistaken interpretation of the 2018 Farm Bill’s definition of ‘hemp’ that companies are leveraging to pursue profits at the expense of public safety and health,” the letter to leaders of the House and Senate appropriations and agriculture committees said. 
THC, short for tetrahydrocannabinol, is a family of more than 100 compounds in cannabis that produces its psychoactive effects, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Only one, delta-9 THC, is controlled in the Farm Bill, while others found in smaller quantities, including delta-8 THC, are unregulated. 
Groups including law enforcement and some in the legal cannabis industry have pressured Congress to close what they dubbed the “delta-8 loophole,” by redefining legal hemp products.

Pennsylvania U.S. Rep. G.T. Thompson (R-15th District), who serves as chair of the House Committee on Agriculture, told Politico last year revisions to the bill would be “one of the more interesting debates and discussions in the farm bill.”
Others say hemp-derived THC products are safe if properly regulated. 
“The problem with that industry is there’s so many loopholes that allow bad operators to come in,” Ryan Burke, president and chief operating officer of boxer Mike Tyson’s cannabis company Tyson 2.0, said during a visit with Pennsylvania lawmakers last week. Although Burke and Tyson were lobbying for a recreational cannabis bill, Tyson 2.0 also sells delta-8 products.
Burke said when states like Pennsylvania don’t have recreational cannabis policy in place, consumers buy products that fall into the loophole industry. 
“And because there’s no testing system to hold them accountable or age gates to ensure that children don’t get their hands on it, it leads to a very bad stigma,” Burke said, adding that he supports a second look at the Farm Bill.
As originally passed, the hemp provisions in the Farm Bill limit the amount of delta-9 THC allowable in hemp products. The House Agriculture Committee in May 2024 passed legislation that would redefine legal hemp using a limit on all forms of THC, but it has not advanced since then.
Sunday said in a statement Tuesday the products are “rampantly available” in Pennsylvania, allowing businesses to profit from selling super-potent, hemp-derived THC products that are often packaged to attract children.
“This unregulated market allows children to buy these extremely potent products, oftentimes without any knowledge that the products are intoxicating, addictive, and not safe,” Sunday said.
Pennsylvania allows adults to buy cannabis with a prescription for treatment of conditions ranging from terminal illnesses such as cancer to psychiatric conditions like anxiety. 
State lawmakers have also flirted with legalizing adult-use recreational cannabis, but have been unable to agree on a business model. Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro pitched legalized recreational cannabis in his budget proposal this year as a revenue source that could produce hundreds of millions in new taxes.
Four of the commonwealth’s neighboring states have legalized recreational cannabis, and proponents note Pennsylvania is losing money when residents cross state lines to legally purchase cannabis products. 
The 2018 Agricultural Improvement Act legalized hemp for commercial use as industrial fiber, in food or in wellness products. While hemp and cannabis are the same plant, the law defined hemp as cannabis with less than 0.3% delta-9 THC by dry weight.
“Yet, through use of highly advanced chemical processes — not contemplated by Congress when it enacted the 2018 Farm Bill — to manipulate the hemp plant, the psychoactive hemp industry artificially produces various forms of THC,” the attorneys general letter says, noting they’re often packaged as gummies, candies and beverages.
“In this way, legal, nonintoxicating hemp is used to make Frankenstein THC products that get adults high and harm and even kill children,” the letter says.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/20210420_111009-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-04 20:22:13.767398

The former vice president died Monday at the age of 84. His passing represents the end of an era in Wyoming politics, those who knew him say.
The post Wyoming remembers Dick Cheney, the state’s most powerful and polarizing politician appeared first on WyoFile .","Two years out of office and two years ahead of a heart transplant that would carry him through his twilight years, former Vice President Dick Cheney stood backstage at the Conservative Political Action Conference 2010 in Washington, D.C.
One his daughters, Liz, stood center stage, several years before she herself would hold federal office, and a decade before she’d cast an impeachment vote against then-President Donald Trump that would effectively end her political career in Wyoming. 
“There is one man in particular we all know who certainly has taught me what it means to have the courage of your convictions,” she said, as seen in a C-SPAN clip. “You know who I’m talking about.”
As her father climbed the stairs onto the stage and took to the lectern, the crowd erupted into a two-minute-long standing ovation. 
“Knock it off,” he said, chuckling. “A welcome like that is almost enough for me to run for office again.” 
It was a surprise appearance, according to reporting by NPR, and it would mark one of the last moments of hearty public adoration for the former vice president whose legacy included representing Wyoming for 10 years in congress, serving as secretary of defense during the George H.W. Bush administration and helping lead the country’s response to the 9/11 attacks as vice president. 
Cheney died Monday at the age of 84 due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease.  

Dick Cheney speaks at a July 26, 2000 rally at Natrona County High School in Casper, Wyoming. Then Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush announced Cheney as his running mate. (Bruce Nichols/Casper College Public Relations Department Photographs and Records. Casper College Archives and Special Collections. Western History Center).  

“Dick Cheney was a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness and flying fishing,” his family said in a statement. “We are grateful beyond measure for all Dick Cheney did for our country. And we are blessed beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.”
Cheney’s later years would be defined by his staunch opposition to Trump, particularly after the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the Capitol. 
“In our nation’s 246 year history there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our Republic than Donald Trump,” he said in a campaign advertisement for his daughter Liz, who was then serving as Wyoming’s lone congressional representative. 
That opposition led to a dramatic rethinking of the Cheneys. Once seen as arch conservatives, they were quickly vilified by many on the right, including in Wyoming. But many who had criticized Dick Cheney for his actions after 9/11 saw him and his daughter Liz as principled defenders of American democracy and the rule of law. 
Response 
While the American flags at the White House had been lowered to half-staff Tuesday, the president had not released a statement on Cheney’s death by publishing time. 
In Wyoming, Gov. Mark Gordon ordered the lowering of the flags until the day after interment.
“Wyoming has lost one of its own,” Gordon said in a statement. “Former Vice President Dick Cheney served our nation with an unwavering sense of duty shaped by the grit and resolve of this state. Dick carried Wyoming values with him, his steadfast commitment, quiet strength, and a fierce belief in America.”
Other prominent members of the Wyoming GOP weighed in too, including U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, who paid tribute Tuesday on the Senate floor. 
“Dick is going to be remembered as a towering figure who helped guide the course of history, certainly in Wyoming and also in the United States and of course, around the world,” Barrasso said. “My prayers are with his wife, Lynn, with daughters Liz and Mary, and with his grandchildren as they celebrate this incredible man.”
Wyoming’s junior senator, Cynthia Lummis, offered her condolences in a press release.
“For more than 10 years, he worked alongside Senators Malcolm Wallop and Al Simpson as the most formidable Congressional delegation in Washington,” Lummis wrote. “As the first Wyoming citizen to be elected Vice President, he holds a defining place in our state’s history.” 
When asked for a comment, U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, who defeated Liz Cheney in 2022 with Trump’s backing, sent a statement to WyoFile.
“You couldn’t grow up in Wyoming and not know who Dick Cheney was. He dedicated most of his life to serving his country, working across multiple administrations and finally capping his public career as an extremely consequential vice president,” Hageman wrote. “He was known as a meticulous, detail-oriented planner who prioritized his family. Dick Cheney had an undeniable impact on American policy, both foreign and domestic, for decades, and will be studied and remembered for many years more than that.”
Other politicos shared more critical comments on Cheney’s foreign policy, particularly his role in America’s post-9/11 wars in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria and Yemen. 
“There is no doubt that Dick Cheney was a prominent figure in Wyoming. He had a successful career working towards unjustified wars and the expansion of the power of the executive branch way beyond the scope of the constitution,” the Libertarian Party of Wyoming wrote in a Facebook post.
Cheney “helped lie about weapons of mass destruction that ended up killing thousands of American troops and countless civilians of foreign countries,” the party wrote. 
“That being said, the Libertarian Party wishes the Cheney family comfort as they mourn the death of a man that meant more to them than he did to us,” the post reads. 
Former colleagues 
Though the two didn’t share a political party or many policy positions, former Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan said he had a “very positive” experience working with Cheney. 
“We had a great congressional delegation that was easy to work with, even across the aisle, and Dick was certainly one of the major players, both in the delegation and in Congress,” Sullivan told WyoFile.

When asked about how the meaning of the Cheney name has evolved in Wyoming in recent years, particularly in GOP circles, Sullivan said “it’s a reflection of how things have changed.”
“That is, you know, ‘If you’re not with me, you’re against me.’ There’s no in in-between, seemingly, anymore,” Sullivan said. “And I think that’s a shame because Dick Cheney did great things for Wyoming.”
They didn’t always agree, Sullivan said, but one place the two were able to meet in the middle involved balancing certain interests.
“I’ve always said that the most difficult position the governor has is walking that fine, bright line between conservation and development,” Sullivan said. “And those were issues that we shared. He was a conservationist in so many ways, an outdoorsman, and cherished the same things most of us cherish in Wyoming.”
In the 1980s, Phil Hocker, a Jackson resident and former board member of the Sierra Club, worked with Cheney on the Wyoming Wilderness Act. The state’s delegation had heard widespread outcries against unbridled drilling, including in roadless areas, and was open to compromise, Hocker recalled. 
The legislation, which added 1.1 million acres of national forest lands to the Wilderness preservation system, forever preventing development and motorized use, was complex and could have faltered but “Dick kept it going,” Hocker said. 
When it became law, Cheney followed up with a letter to Hocker characterizing the measure as “a fine addition to Wyoming’s great wilderness resource,” Hocker said. 
“Courtesies mean a lot,” Hocker said, “and he always got them done.”
Former Wyoming Gov. Jim Geringer, a Republican whose time in office overlapped with Cheney’s vice presidency, told WyoFile Cheney “always had a quiet demeanor.”
“He was just quiet, and very articulate in the way he could express or sum up an issue,” Geringer said, adding it stands in contrast to some of today’s politicians “that feel like yelling and confrontation are the best way to do things.” 
Like others, Geringer lamented the loss of Cheney so soon after the passing of former U.S. Senator and storied politician Al Simpson. 
“Alan and Dick really represented that era of a quieter and more thoughtful approach to resolving issues,” Geringer said, adding that each also brought a sense of humor to difficult conversations.
Part of Cheney’s legacy, Geringer said, was “he made sure he was extremely well informed. He didn’t just plow headlong into an issue and let the chips fall where they may.”

When Eli Bebout, former state Senate president, ran for governor in 2002, Cheney “really helped us a lot, and did some wonderful things for my campaign.”
Ultimately, Bebout came up short to Democrat Dave Freudenthal, but his relationship with Cheney extended beyond the campaign trail. 
“I would consider him a friend,” Bebout said, adding that he and Cheney were part of a group that for many years went on both annual fishing trips and pheasant hunts. 
Bebout admired Cheney’s “grasp of the issues,” but also his quick wit. 
There was once a political radio show in Riverton, Bebout said, called “Chit Chat” that was a must-stop for statewide candidates, including Cheney when he was running for Congress. 
Unbeknownst to Cheney, Bebout said, the radio station, located in a small house, had a year earlier moved to another location. But running late, Cheney barged into the house only to find a woman in robe, bewildered by the strange man standing in her living room. 
“She says, ‘Well, who in the heck are you?’ And he said, ‘Well, I’m Al Simpson. I apologize.’” 
Cheney’s death is largely the end of an era in Wyoming politics, Bebout said.
“The name ‘Dick Cheney’ is more than just Wyoming, or Casper, where he was raised,” Bebout said. “It’s our country, the world. It’s a legacy for sure.”

Wisconsin's health department, which administers the state's FoodShare program funded through SNAP, said Tuesday November benefits will be reduced and could take weeks to be paid. (Getty Images)Despite court orders for the federal government to resume sending federal funds to the states for food assistance programs for the month of November, the money will take weeks or longer to arrive and will only cover a portion of the benefits people are supposed to receive, Wisconsin’s health department confirmed Tuesday.
The delay is a result of the federal decision to spend only the contingency funds said aside for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP, according to a statement late Tuesday afternoon from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services communications office. DHS administers Wisconsin SNAP benefits through the state’s FoodShare program.
SNAP benefits stopped flowing Nov. 1 as a result of the federal government shutdown, which has halted federal spending in all but some specific functions of the government.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture declined to tap other funding sources in order to cover the full benefits for November, a department official said in a court document filed Monday.
About 700,000 Wisconsin residents receive SNAP benefits through the FoodShare program, according to DHS. Benefits are distributed to an electronic “QWEST” card that is used like a debit card to purchase food at participating grocers and other vendors.
According to DHS, because of the benefit reduction, states must recalculate the benefits they send to households enrolled in the SNAP program. States must then send an electronic file with the revised benefit information to the electronic benefit transfer businesses that distribute the funds to members’ QWEST cards.
“Due to the many steps that need to be taken as well as the likely bottleneck of only having two vendors that can deploy benefits to cards, the Trump Administration indicates this process will take weeks to months instead of days compared to the timeline if the federal government had chosen to provide full November benefits to states,” DHS said in an update sent to news organizations Tuesday afternoon.
“Because the federal government chose a more complex pathway, the federal government will need to issue guidance to states and then states will have to determine how to allocate partial benefits to each household,” the DHS update stated. “This means the timeline for partial November benefits to be added to [each] member’s cards is still to be determined.”
A provision in the federal mega-bill cutting spending and taxes that President Donald Trump signed July 4 will further complicate the process, according to DHS.
States with error rates of more than 6% in their SNAP programs will bear additional administrative costs. Paying partial benefits rather than full benefits “will force states to use an unprecedented process instead of the process we would typically use,” according to the DHS update, “which has the potential to jeopardize Wisconsin’s and other states’ error rates.”
DHS has asked the Legislature to allocate an additional $69.2 million to the department to cover anticipated increases in administrative costs and hire additional staff to help keep Wisconsin’s error rate low.
Tables that USDA distributed Tuesday indicate that in 48 states, including Wisconsin, the reduced November benefits will range from $149 a month for a one-person household to $497 for a four-person household and $894 for a household of eight. The DHS update noted that “we caution that the tables don’t necessarily reflect what a family would receive.”
Although the Trump administration agreed in court filings to partially fund November’s SNAP benefits, Trump backtracked on that pledge with a social media post, saying that the benefits would not be released until Democrats in Congress agreed to reopen the government.
Tuesday’s update from DHS alluded to the post, stating that the department is “aware of the president’s recent social media message from this morning” — after DHS received the USDA message and the reduced benefit amounts — “and will continue to monitor activity from the federal government.”

Minneapolis
Over at Bryant Square Park in Uptown Minneapolis, Madeline Schwabe, 26, a nurse at M Health Fairview, said that her health insurance costs have gone up in the past year and voted for state Sen. Omar Fateh — without ranking other candidates — in the hopes of improving “affordability.” 
“It all ties into big businesses, CEOs with a lot of money, not trickling down to the people that are actually in the hospital working,” Schwabe said. 
Dani Wagner said she’s voting for Sen. Omar Fateh for Minneapolis mayor on Nov. 4, 2025 because “he’s got a positive voice for change. He’s got a good head on his shoulders.” (Photo by Alyssa Chen/Minnesota Reformer)
Dani Wagner, 27, a risk manager, said she supported for Fateh because “He’s got a positive voice for change. He’s got a good head on his shoulders.” 
Wagner’s top issue in local elections is bike infrastructure. 
“We have a lot of good infrastructure, but we should keep on going,” Wagner said. 
At Grace Episcopal Church in Southwest Minneapolis, Dana Lindman-Gustner, 57, a human resources professional, said she ranked Frey first despite feeling “ambivalent” about him, followed by Jazz Hampton and DeWayne Davis.
“It was an incredibly difficult decision because I frankly felt that there were no clear choices that aligned completely with my perspectives,” said Lindman-Gustner, whose primary concern is housing and safety. 
For Lindman-Gustner, housing means “safety for everybody, including the unhoused population, but also the neighborhoods in which currently unsanctioned housing is proceeding.” 
She said she probably would have ranked Hampton first had he not joined Fateh in an alliance against Frey — a choice that muddied her understanding of Hampton’s platform. On why she didn’t rank Fateh, Lindman-Guster said that she’s a liberal and not a democratic socialist and also cited concerns about Fateh’s ethics.
Lindman-Gustner, who was born and raised in Minneapolis, said that she doesn’t think any of the candidates have come up with a good plan to bolster the city’s declining tax base. 
“All of these issues require money,” she said. 
Crime was top of mind for many voters in Dinkytown, where one person died and a University of Minnesota student was shot last weekend.
Junior Bailey Taylor, a global political science major, said he ranked Frey first on his ballot because of the mayor’s approach to crime. Taylor, a dual citizen of the U.S. and the United Kingdom, said he hates that people can’t enjoy his home city of London because of crime, and he doesn’t want to see the same fate befall Minneapolis. 
“I can’t go out at nighttime here because it’s just so unsafe,” Taylor said. “I hate having to confine myself to my own apartment.”
Taylor said he wasn’t entirely thrilled with how Frey has run the city so far, but he said the incumbent mayor will be better than Fateh, who once endorsed the defund-the-police movement during his first run for state Senate in 2020. 
“I don’t agree with defunding the police because that is a bit silly, especially in a city like this,” Taylor said.
Senior Max Locketz, a computer science major, said he ranked Fateh first because he wants to see a more progressive Democrat in office. Frey has had the office for a long time, he said, and he’s ready to see someone new elected.
“(Frey’s) certainly not someone who I disagree with a lot of the time, but at some point you see someone that aligns more closely with what you want,” Locketz said. 
Sophomore Vanessa Schaefer said she ranked Fateh first in part because she heard Fateh aims to bring a grocery store to Dinkytown, a notorious food desert for University of Minnesota students. 
Freshman Cameron Kreps, a nursing major, ranked Frey first because he met the mayor at a vigil after the mass shooting at the Church of the Annunciation. Kreps said his father lives two blocks away from the church. 
“The compassion he showed was amazing for all the victims of the Annunciation shooting, for sure, and I just think he’s very relatable and respectable,” Kreps said. 
St. Paul
Ron Dexter, 85, did some quick math and figured out his first vote was for President Lyndon Johnson in 1964.
Dexter was walking into the Martin Luther King Jr. Recreation Center to vote for Carter. “I met him once. I liked him. I like that he’s Black. That’s good for the community,” said Dexter, a Navy veteran who retired after a career as an information technology specialist at the University of Minnesota.
He voted for the education tax increase, too. “Always vote yes on school issues,” he said.
Dexter said the most important policy issues to him are health care, food assistance to people who need it, and protecting trans and other LGBTQ children.
He took out his iPhone, pulled up a to-do list and tapped a box that read, “VOTE.”

Kate Hagen, a 39-year-old consultant, used an online tool developed by Sahan Journal that matched up her issue preferences with candidates.
She matched up with Rep. Kaohly Her, who gave Carter his toughest challenge this year, while ranking the mayor a close second.
She did allow, however, that downtown St. Paul needs revitalization and improved public safety.
“It could be a healthier place to be,” she said.
Hagen doesn’t have children in the district, but she voted for the tax increase for schools.
Education, she said, “is incredibly important and undervalued.”
Jill Howell, 56, said she cares about crime and revitalizing business in St. Paul. Howell ranked state Her first, followed by Yan Chen and then Carter. She said that she liked Her’s experience with Carter’s administration. Howell, a homeowner, voted no on the tax increase for schools. 
“I just felt another tax increase for the schools shouldn’t happen,” Howell said, criticizing the district for not being transparent enough about how it spends money. Howell volunteered at her son’s elementary school library when he was a kid after the district cut funding for librarians. 
Katrina Brown, 39, who works in university relations for a study- abroad program and recently moved to St. Paul, said she voted for Carter after talking to her family and friends about her priorities. She said she felt aligned with Carter on important issues to her — such as education and fighting the Trump administration — but “will see how I might change my mind after living here longer than a few years.” 
Max Degree, 28, an operations manager for Lime scooters, voted for Adam Dullinger without ranking other candidates. 
“I am not a big fan of the center-left,” Degree said. “I felt that Dullinger was the furthest left on the ballot.” Dullinger is the only mayoral candidate who supports St. Paul’s 2021 rent control ordinance and opposes Carter’s exceptions for new construction, the Star Tribune reported. 
Her, Degree said, is too “fundamentally similar” to her old political mentor. Her has told the Star Tribune that “values-wise, (Carter) and I share a lot of similar values,” but sets herself apart from Carter in how she shows up and builds relationships.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0532-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-04 19:56:35.036944

(Photo by John McCosh/Georgia Recorder)A federal appeals court rejected a legal challenge to a Florida law aimed at blocking Chinese citizens from purchasing Florida land, a decision that was quickly hailed by some of the state’s Republican leaders who pushed the 2023 law.
The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that the Chinese citizens who sued lacked standing to bring the initial lawsuit.
Two judges of a three-judge panel, Barbara Lagoa and Robert Luck, ruled hat the Chinese citizens, Yifan Shen, Yongxin Liu, Zhiming Xu, and Xinxi Wang, did not have the legal right to challenge the law that restricts foreign purchase of land in Florida. The judges were appointed to the federal appeals court by President Donald Trump.
Prior to their appointment both had previously served on the Florida Supreme Court, appointed to the state’s high court by Gov. Ron DeSantis. 
The law, SB 624 passed in 2023, made it illegal for people domiciled in China and not citizens of the U.S. from purchasing real estate in Florida. And, if they already own property, to report that ownership. 
The legislation was pushed amid fears that people and businesses linked to the Chinese Communist Party would acquire either agricultural land or land near important installations.
But the group that sued argued that the law violated equal protection rights by discriminating against people who are Chinese. The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida and the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund filed the suit on behalf of the plaintiffs. 
A lower court judge had found that those suing were eligible to move forward but he turned down their request to preliminarily block the law from taking effect.
The appeals court said the district court was right in finding that the plaintiffs “aren’t substantially likely to succeed on their preemption claim.”
But the judges also concluded that there was no threat of “imminent injury” by those who sued.
The circuit judges said the district court was right in finding that the plaintiffs “aren’t substantially likely to succeed on their preemption claim.”
The lawsuit was filed against Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson as well as other state officials and state attorneys in Daytona Beach, Orlando, and Miami, where the plaintiff property-in-question is located. 
The law prohibits land ownership by Chinese citizens, except for up to two acres, that may not be located near a military installation. 
According to court documents, the plaintiffs are in the United States under visas, including student, tourist, and H1-B visas. 
The now-law passed the House 95-17 and the Senate 31-8, proving bipartisan support, although not unanimous. Opposition in public testimony often expressed the law would prohibit people from buying land based on national origin, even if they weren’t the original target of the legislation.
The initial suit was filed in May 2023.
DeSantis and Attorney General James Uthmeier welcomed the ruling on social media Tuesday.

The ACLU issued a statement disagreeing with the court’s decision.
“All people, regardless of where they come from, should be free to buy homes and build lives in Florida without fear of discrimination,” Ashley Gorski, an ACLU attorney said in a news release. “Although today’s decision is disappointing, we’ll continue to fight laws like these that blatantly target immigrants based on their national origin and ethnicity.”

 Dissenting opinion

Judge Charles Wilson, a President Bill Clinton appointee, dissented “to address the majority’s dubious equal protection and preemption analyses.”
In his dissent, he said regulation lies with the federal Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews transactions that pose a risk to national security.
“This case marks an early opportunity to consider the preemptive scope of CFIUS review, but this is not the first time Florida has attempted to regulate foreign investments, nor is Florida the first state to impose on this federal terrain,” Wilson wrote.

After orders from two federal judges, USDA has agreed to release emergency funding to partially cover November SNAP payments during the federal government shutdown.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
The Vermont Agency of Human Services has received new instructions from the U.S. Department of Agriculture about how to distribute federal emergency funding for November food assistance benefits. 
State agency officials are still working to understand the new federal guidance. However, state-funded benefits for the first half of the month, approved last week by Vermont officials, will still be available for Vermonters on Friday, according to Ashley Roy, an agency spokesperson.
Funding sources for SNAP have been “very fluid,” Roy said in an emailed statement on behalf of the Department for Children and Families, which administers 3SquaresVT, Vermont’s version of SNAP.

“DCF understands how difficult the uncertainty at this time is for Vermonters and will continue to update impacted households via calls and text as more information becomes available,” Roy said.
SNAP benefits, which are normally expected on the first of the month, had been paused by the USDA amid the federal shutdown.
The USDA indicated Monday in court filings that it would use $4.65 billion in contingency funding to distribute “50% of eligible households’ current (SNAP) allotments” for November. For Vermont, half of the monthly program cost would amount to roughly $6 million. 
The announcement follows orders from two federal judges on Friday stating that the USDA must fund its largest food assistance program this month. One such order, from Judge Indira Talwani in Massachusetts, came as part of a multistate lawsuit joined last week by Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark. The suit sought a temporary restraining order against the federal government’s refusal to use emergency funds for the nutrition assistance program this month.
“The U.S. Department of Agriculture is complying with the Court’s order and will fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds today,” Patrick A. Penn of the USDA wrote in a Monday court filing. 
Penn said his department’s contingency fund will be exhausted after half of November benefits have been paid out nationwide. No new applicants for SNAP will receive funding this month, he added. 
The USDA’s commitment comes after Vermont officials on the state’s Emergency Board approved a $6.5 million plan to fund food assistance for the first half of November, which included direct assistance to the Vermont Food Bank.
Sen. Andrew Perchlik, D/P-Washington, who sits on the Emergency Board as chair of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, agreed that federal promises have not yet resulted in clarity at the state level. 
“We don’t really know what the feds are doing,” he said, adding that he agrees with sending out the state-funded food assistance as soon as possible. If the state funds half of November and the USDA covers the other half, that would be a “good outcome,” he said.
Penn said the USDA also considered using another source of discretionary funding to cover the rest of the month’s benefits, but determined that doing so would create an “unacceptable risk” for child nutrition programs backed by that pot of money.
Clark disagreed, pushing for full coverage of the program.
“I am disappointed by the USDA’s filing which fails to fully fund SNAP benefits,” she said in a Tuesday statement. “Partial benefits are not enough to keep food on the table this month — and by withholding full funding, the Trump Administration is choosing to let families go hungry.”
Statements from Washington added to confusion on Tuesday. After Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins stated that her agency would assist states in distributing the partial benefits, President Donald Trump said on social media Tuesday that SNAP would not be available until the government reopened.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-05 00:12:03+00:00,Mississippi Today,Reeves unveils Mississippi’s proposal for Rural Health Transformation Program one day before deadline,Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/04/reeves-unveils-mississippis-proposal-for-rural-health-transformation-program-one-day-before-deadline/,"Some critics have called the funding program a “Band-Aid,” emphasizing that it is temporary and will not cover all of the losses hospitals are expected to bear as a result of cuts to Medicaid in rural areas.","Mississippi’s $500 million plan for transforming rural health care over the next five years includes collaboration between providers, expanding the medical workforce, advancing health technology and closing gaps in care. But details about specific programs to accomplish those goals were sparse. 
“While Mississippi has long faced challenges in delivering access to quality health care in rural areas, our plan is designed to address those challenges head-on,” Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said during a press conference Tuesday. 
The funding will be doled out to states over five years as part of the one-time federal $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program, beginning in 2026. Mississippi is expected to receive at least $500 million – and possibly more – as a part of the program, the governor said. 
Virtually every county will be included in the plan, which will be implemented with a focus on transparency and evaluating outcomes, said Reeves, who will oversee and coordinate the program. A third-party organization will assist with deploying funds, tracking milestones and assessing outcomes, and the governor’s office will work closely with the Mississippi Department of Health and Division of Medicaid, Reeves said. 
Reeves called the application process a “60-day sprint.” Guidelines for the funding were released bv the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Sep. 15, giving states less than two months to submit a proposal. Awards will be determined by the end of the year. 
Mississippi’s plan includes six initiatives: 

A comprehensive statewide assessment to study rural health care needs today and for the next 10 years, conducted by a third-party. Reeves did not say how the third-party would be chosen. 
Coordinated regional integrated systems to create a data-driven network for emergency, clinical and community-based services. 
Workforce expansion through targeted programs that address recruitment, retention, training and career pathway development for health care professionals.
Health technology advancement to modernize rural health care systems by strengthening a digital backbone that supports high quality, coordinated and secure care. 
Telehealth adoption and provider support designed to strengthen rural health care by increasing virtual care access, assisting providers with telehealth adoption and exploring innovative payment models.
Building rural health infrastructure to improve access to specialized care, close care gaps and support innovative pilot programs aimed at enhancing health care delivery and improving outcomes. 

Reeves said the state’s full application would not immediately be made public. The state will work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to determine when part or all of the plan can be released, he said. 
The funding program for rural health was tacked on to President Donald Trump’s tax-and-spending law passed this summer, which is expected to result in significant losses to federal Medicaid spending in rural areas. Congressional Republicans added the one-time money for rural health to soften the blow associated with the cuts. 
An estimated $137 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid spending are expected in rural areas over 10 years, meaning Rural Health Transformation Program funds will offset just over a third of the cuts, according to analysis from KFF. 
More than half of Mississippi’s rural hospitals are at risk of closing, according to a recent report by the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform. Hospital leaders have warned that the federal cuts could force some rural hospitals to stop some services or close their doors altogether. 
In Mississippi, cuts to state-directed payments, which help hospitals offset low Medicaid payments, will amount to a loss of $160 million a year statewide beginning in 2029, Mississippi Medicaid Director Cindy Bradshaw said previously. 
Some critics have called the funding program a “Band-Aid,” emphasizing that it is temporary and will not cover all of the losses hospitals are expected to bear as a result of cuts to Medicaid in rural areas.
The state’s plan for the Rural Health Transformation Program will not include direct financial assistance to hospitals, which the federal government has made clear it will not approve, Reeves said. 
“Every facility in our state is going to have to continue to think through what exactly their business model looks like,” he said. “And hopefully, that will lead to some efficiencies.” 
Half of the $50 billion program will be distributed evenly among all states with approved applications. The other half will be calculated based on a formula that calculates each states’ rurality, the quality of its application and alignment with Make America Healthy Again policies. 
Mississippi has recently taken steps to adopt policies that receive higher scores, including reestablishing the Presidential Fitness Test in schools and seeking a waiver to restrict purchases of sugary foods and drinks through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
Mississippi is likely to receive a large share of funding based on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rubric, according to experts. Mississippi scores sixth out of all states, according to estimates by the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina. That means the state is likely to receive a larger sum of money from the program. 
Some state lawmakers have expressed frustration that they have not been more involved in crafting the state’s proposal, noting that they have the responsibility of appropriating the funds. 
House Speaker Jason White said legislators should have input on the plan during a state budget hearing Sep. 24. Weeks later, at the Medicaid Advisory Committee meeting Oct. 17, Medicaid Chair Rep. Missy McGee, a Republican from Hattiesburg, said legislators would like to see the plan. 
Reeves said Tuesday legislators have been engaged in crafting the plan, as have other stakeholders, including the Department of Education, Department of Mental Health, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and other partners.
“We’ve had extensive conversations with legislators and legislative leaders over the last short while,” Reeves said. “…Obviously, this plan doesn’t happen in a vacuum. We’ve been having conversations with them.” 
The program is not just about spending a lot of federal money, said State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney.

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)David Sanders, who previously served as the executive director of the Montana Public Service Commission, announced Tuesday he will run for an elected post with the commission in 2026.
The five-member Public Service Commission regulates monopoly utilities in Montana.
Sanders, a Helena Republican, will run in District No. 5, a district representing northwest Montana east of Kalispell.
In an interview, Sanders said the PSC has a responsibility to the people of Montana, and it needs to get back on track.
“I feel a lot of personal investment and ownership of the work that we did at the PSC when I was there, and I still follow it very closely,” Sanders said.
He described staff at the agency as “really outstanding professional public servants” with whom he worked in 2024, but he also said change is needed within the commission.
“I think people forget that the first two words of Public Service Commission are ‘public service,’” Sanders said. “That should be the focus of the PSC, and not private grievances or political gamesmanship.”
The Public Service Commission has been riddled with political strife in recent months, and Sanders’ announcement is in part a bid to help bring a renewed sense of mission to the organization he helped lead for a year in 2024.
In July, former PSC President Brad Molnar announced he was under investigation for professional misconduct in a case that’s pending; Molnar has admitted only to being unrefined in his interactions.
Since then, fellow commissioners ousted him as president, an internal team asked the governor to suspend Molnar from office, and Molnar filed a complaint against another commissioner with the state’s ethics watchdog alleging misuse of state resources.
In the meantime, the Public Service Commission faces significant issues, such as a multi-pronged rate case by NorthWestern Energy, the state’s largest utility, and its proposed merger with Black Hills Corp.
“I feel very confident that we can refocus the PSC on its mission,” Sanders said. “I think that’s a function of leadership, and I think I can provide that leadership. I did at the staff level previously, and I think it will be even easier as a commissioner.”
His announcement comes with a political endorsement right out of the gate, a nod from a statewide elected Republican that’s not a given in a potential primary race.
State Auditor James Brown, who previously served as president of the PSC, helped hire Sanders as director there, and then brought Sanders on as chief of staff when he took the helm of the Auditor’s Office.
Having served four years as a commissioner, Brown said he saw how important the agency is to both the citizens of Montana and to the economy of the state.
“I have an interest in ensuring the people who serve on that commission are interested in being good public servants and that agency is functioning at its maximum,” Brown said.
He would lose Sanders as his chief of staff, but for the good of Montana, Brown said he was excited to hear Sanders wanted to run for office with the agency given his chief executive, senior government and military background.
Sanders previously served as a member of the Senior Management Team of the U.S. Department of Transportation; chief executive of one of the DOT’s operating administrations; and staff director of the Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade of the U.S. House of Representative’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, according to the January 2024 announcement the PSC released when it hired Sanders.
Brown and Sanders worked together at the PSC after it received poor reviews from the Legislative Audit Division, and Brown said he can attest to Sanders’ executive leadership skills and ability to be a turnaround agent.
“He has the skillset and relationships to do that,” Brown said.
Commissioner Annie Bukacek currently holds the District 5 seat, and she did not return a message Tuesday about whether she intends to file for re-election in 2026.
In 2022, Bukacek, a Republican and controversial doctor from the Flathead Valley, bested her Democratic challenger, John Repke, with 56% of the vote. The PSC districts have since been redrawn.
 Sanders on PSC work

In recent years, members of the Public Service Commission have voted to give monopoly utilities the rate increases they’ve wanted, but Sanders said it’s time to put the claims utilities make to the test.
“For many years, the Public Service Commission failed to fully scrutinize the rate cases that were put before them,” Sanders said.
The Montana Consumer Counsel looks out for ratepayers, he said, but it’s “grossly outmanned,” especially compared to the lawyers and lobbyists South Dakota’s NorthWestern Energy and Montana-Dakota Utilities have, Sanders said.
“We have to keep an eye on these out-of-state power companies and how they charge our ratepayers and whether or not they’re providing adequate service,” Sanders said.
He said commissioners need to take a closer look at planning decisions, infrastructure investments — such as NorthWestern’s Yellowstone County Generating Station — and even executive pay.
He said he isn’t inherently opposed to natural gas as a power source, but if a company wants ratepayers to pay for an investment, the deal requires scrutiny.
“You can’t just assume that what the regulated entity is putting forward is what is absolutely necessary,” Sanders said. “You have to have professionals and experts looking things over very closely, having very, very, very sharp pencils, and trying to protect the ratepayers as best they can.”
The work the PSC does with NorthWestern and MDU is high profile, but Sanders also pointed to the importance of its other responsibilities, such as doing inspections related to rail carriers, or BNSF, and regulating land line communications, garbage companies, and small water utilities.
“There’s a lot that the PSC does in its scope and mandate, or that it should be doing,” Sanders said. “But … unfortunately, personal animosities and petty grievances seem to be what the PSC has been focused on since January of this year.”
Montana has a 21st century economy, he said, but it’s powered by an ancient grid, and the state needs new sources of power and new ways of transmitting and distributing it to continue propelling the economy.
And he said it’s important for PSC members to understand the importance of regulated utilities to plan for the economic future. Sanders has a degree in economics from the College of William & Mary in Virginia.
“The American economy in particular, but all global economies, have usually been fueled by inexpensive power and inexpensive money, (or) low interest rates and abundant power,” he said.
“If we can get back to those days, there are no limits to what the American economy, what the Montana economy, can do.”
 Sanders’ personal background

Sanders, 65, came to Montana in 2022 to live near his son, but he considers himself a fourth generation Montanan, with a father born in Darby, grandfather from Stevensville, and great-grandfather an early Montana pioneer.
Sanders grew up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., and he served on his town council for 19 years in McLean, Virginia, originally elected as a youth member, and later serving as chairperson, he said.
He also served as a U.S. Army officer from 1981 to 1989, he said, and earlier in the ROTC, the Reserve Officers’ Training Corp.
Sanders lives in Helena with his wife, Kathie Sanders, and his son, Don Sanders, also lives in Helena.
He announced his candidacy Tuesday; the official filing date for public office is in January 2026.
In PSC District No. 1, Jeff Pattison, of Glasgow, and Jeremy Trebas, a state senator from Great Falls, both Republicans, have filed campaign paperwork with the Commissioner of Political Practices.

Erin Grall said the legislation updates Florida statutes to reflect a post Roe v Wade environmentBy a razor-thin margin a Senate panel Tuesday passed a bill that would allow lawsuits for the wrongful death of fetuses at any stage of development in the womb, even if the fetus wouldn’t have been able to survive outside of the womb.
The Senate Committee on Judiciary voted 5-4 to advance the bill, SB 164, by Sen. Erin Grall, a Republican from Fort Pierce.
Sen. Kathleen Passidomo, a Republican from Naples, and Sen. Tom Leek, a Republican from St. Augustine, voted against the bill, along with Sen. Lori Berman, a Democrat from Boynton Beach, and Sen. Tina Polsky, a Democrat from West Palm Beach.
Democratic Sen. Rosalind Osgood, who also serves on the Senate Committee on Judiciary, wasn’t in attendance, nor was Sen. Nick DiCeglie, a Republican from St. Petersburg. Senate documents show both senators had excused absences.
In a prepared statement, Michelle Grimsley Shindano, Planned Parenthood Florida Action’s director of policy and government affairs, blasted the vote.
“SB 164 could be the beginning of a slippery slope where the state treats embryos and fetuses as ‘persons’ under the law. If embryos and fetuses were granted the same rights as a pregnant patient, that would take away the patient’s right to make health care decisions that are best for their body and specific situation, including in emergencies. That means lawyers, not doctors, will be consulted if that patient needs health care, including in an emergency,” she said.
Under current law, damages for the death of an unborn child are not recoverable under the state’s wrongful death act, which allows for recovery of medical or funeral bills and the past and future pain and suffering. However, per a 1997 Florida Supreme Court ruling, damages may be recoverable for “negligent stillbirth” in a common law case. Those damages are limited to mental pain and anguish and medical expenses incurred incident to the pregnancy. 
Common law refers a body of law developed through judicial decisions and precedents, not by statutes.
Defining “unborn child”
Specifically, the bill defines “unborn child” as a “member of the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.”
That definition alarmed abortion-rights advocates and Democratic lawmakers on the panel who said the proposal was a back door to further reduce access to reproductive health care.
Proponents of the legislation also had concerns with the definition of unborn child saying it would exempt from potential lawsuits in vitro fertilization providers. IVF is a fertility treatment where an egg is fertilized by sperm in a lab, then the resulting embryo is transferred to a woman’s uterus.
Grall said the bill updates Florida’s statute to reflect a post Roe v. Wade environment and fetus viability. Grall, who has unsuccessfully pushed the legislation in the past, also sponsored the state’s six-week abortion ban.
Republican senator refiles bill permitting suits in wrongful death of fetuses

“Roe has been thrown out as the basis for determining when a life deserves the protection of the state. And in the state of Florida, we have decided that that is at six weeks, that is very young. We have also decided that in our criminal statute it is when it is in the womb, when in the mother, that is when it deserves protection.”

The legislation comes as wrongful death cases for fetuses have been brought in Texas and Arizona. In Texas, a man sued three friends of his now ex-wife for $1 million each for helping his then-wife access abortion pills.
In Arizona, a man accompanied his former wife to her abortion appointment, then, two years later following their divorce, filed a wrongful death suit against the clinic. 
The Senate legislation comes as the House champions an effort to expand the state’s wrongful death laws to allow parents of adult children and children of single adult parents to pursue wrongful death cases against hospitals and physicians. Florida law bans those groups of people from filing wrongful death suits. Gov. Ron DeSantis vetoed legislation earlier this year that would have changed the law. 
Despite the veto, the House is moving the legislation again this year.
SB 164 heads to the Senate Appropriations Committee on Criminal and Civil Justice and Senate Rules committees next.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)LSU did not comply with state public notice requirements ahead of the first meeting of a committee that’s helping guide the University of New Orleans’ transition to the LSU System. The miscue opens up any action the committee takes at its meeting Wednesday to being nullified in court. 
According to Louisiana’s Open Meetings Law, governmental entities at all levels have to give the public 24 hours written notice of any meeting. Because the UNO transition committee meeting starts at 9 a.m. Wednesday, its notice should have been posted online and at the door of the campus venue where the meeting will be held by 9 a.m. Tuesday. The law also requires the notice be sent to any member of the public who requests it. 
But none of that happened. The meeting notice was not posted until nearly 4 p.m Tuesday, after the Illuminator asked LSU about the lack of notice. 
Scott Sternberg, an attorney who specializes in First Amendment cases and often represents the news media, said the only way a public body can get around noticing requirements is if it involves an emergency meeting, which is not the case for the UNO transition panel. 
“The right to observe meetings of the government is in the Constitution. That means it’s one of our most important rights,” Sternberg said. “In theory, the meeting could be completely annulled based on the failure to notify.” 
Louisiana law allows judges to invalidate any actions taken during a meeting at which the state Open Meetings Law is violated, as could be the case with Wednesday’s meeting if members take any official votes.
The committee is advising the LSU Board of Supervisors on transferring UNO from the University of Louisiana System to its own system. The group is made up of stakeholders from the Greater New Orleans region as well as members of the Louisiana Legislature’s education committees. 
LSU was not able to provide a list of transition committee members.

Delroy Dasent faces two counts of second-degree murder stemming from deadly shootings in Burlington and South Burlington on the same night.

File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
BURLINGTON – Opening testimony in a double murder trial offered details of a defendant who described himself as a “vigilante” after being arrested in a night of two murders in the Burlington area.
A prosecutor described 55-year-old Denroy Dasent as a cold-blooded killer of two men, shooting both of them at close range, one as he was lying in bed.
Dasent’s attorney countered that the evidence wasn’t clear, and there certainly wasn’t enough to convict his client of charges that could send him to prison for the rest of his life.
Those were the competing arguments jurors heard Tuesday in Chittenden County Superior criminal court in Burlington during the opening statements from lawyers on the first day of Dasent’s double-murder trial.
Neither the prosecution nor the defense talked to the jury about a motive for the killings, which took place about three hours apart in neighboring towns. 
After Dasent was eventually apprehended, an investigator asked him what offenses he should face, the prosecutor said Tuesday. Dasent replied to the detective, “I should be charged with being a vigilante,”  the prosecutor added. 
Chittenden County Deputy State’s Attorney Kelton Olney, the prosecutor, said to the jury that on the night of Oct. 2, 2022, Dasent first fatally shot 40-year-old Sheiknoor Osman at a Pine Street apartment in Burlington as Osman was lying in bed.

Olney said an eyewitness would testify that Dasent did not say a word to Osman before shooting him at close range, or display any anger toward Osman.
Then, as police were investigating that slaying, Olney said, Dasent fired the shots that killed  37-year-old Brian K. Billings II outside a room where Billings had been living at the Swiss Host Motel on Williston Road in South Burlington. 
Olney spent the next roughly 15 minutes walking the jury through testimony and evidence that  he said prosecutors planned to present during the trial as they seek to prove that Dasent committed two counts of second-degree murder.
Dasent was arrested shortly after the second killing on Burlington’s waterfront, when police had tracked him down after being alerted that a gold sport-utility vehicle he was driving had also been spotted near the Pine Street homicide scene in Burlington, Olney said. 
A couple days after the shooting, according to Olney, a police dive team recovered a 10 mm Glock gun from the lake near where Dasent had been arrested, and that weapon matched one that Dasent’s wife had previously purchased. 
“You will hear that Mr. Dasent had access to that Glock 10 millimeter,” the prosecutor told the jurors.
Forensic analysis also showed that shell casings from both deadly shooting scenes showed they were fired from that same gun, Olney said. 
Andrew Schmidt, one of Dasent’s attorneys, compared the case during his shorter opening remarks to jurors to trying to put together a used jigsaw puzzle, where some of the pieces may be missing.
Schmidt told the jury to “dig down” into the details presented during the trial. “We’re going to ask you to find that some of those pieces don’t fit,” he said.
Tricia Guyette, the first witness, testified that the shooter, who she later identified as Dasent, forced his way into the Pine Street apartment where she had been along with Osman on the night of Oct. 2, 2022. 
She testified that at the time the building had been a known place for people to use and sell illegal drugs, and Dasent was someone who would go there. 
Guyette told the jurors she tried to shut a door to a room on Dasent, but he got in and shot Osman repeatedly as he was laying on a bed. Dasent, she said, didn’t say anything. Instead, according to Guyette, he “emptied the clip,” firing off what she believed were five rounds from his gun she described as a Glock.
Another witness Tuesday, Kylie Clark, who lived with Billings at the Swiss Host Motel in South Burlington at the time of his fatal shooting, testified that a man, who she later identified as Dasent, knocked on the apartment door, asking to speak with Billings.
Billings then went outside the apartment. Next, Clark testified, she heard what sounded like a car backfiring or gunshots. She told jurors that she then saw Billings coming back into the apartment, bleeding, before he collapsed while Dasent walked away. Billings was later pronounced dead at the scene.
Clark testified that she and Billings had known Dasent as “Delroy.” She added that Dasent had lived at the Swiss Host Motel in the past and she knew he ran a restaurant in the food court of the University Mall in South Burlington.
Dan Maguire, a lawyer also representing Dasent, asked Clark if she had witnessed the shooting, and she said he had not.
Lt. Michael Beliveau of the Burlington Police Department also testified Tuesday. His body camera footage from that night was played for the jury, showing, at one point after he was apprehended, Dasent telling police he had “clapped” two men. Asked by the prosecutor what he believed the term meant, Beliveau testified Tuesday that it was a slang term for “killed.” 
Also on the body camera footage, Dasant could be heard saying, “I will kill for my kids.”
Cpl. Cory Campbell, also of the Burlington Police Department, testified that when officers were trying to arrest Dasent, he repeatedly refused commands, and one officer had to use a Taser on him. After that proved unsuccessful, Campbell said he fired a bean bag round at Dasent, who eventually complied with police orders and was taken into custody. 
Dasent, dressed in a white button down shirt and dark pants, sat throughout Tuesday’s proceedings at the defense table between his attorneys. He appeared to pay close attention to the testimony throughout the day, at times chatting with his lawyers. 
Jurors are expected to return to the courthouse Wednesday to continue to hear testimony in the case that is scheduled to run through the week. 
“You are the sole judge of the facts,” Judge John Pacht told the jury shortly after swearing them in Tuesday.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)  At least five members of South Carolina’s congressional delegation have asked to have their salaries withheld until the ongoing federal government shutdown finally comes to an end.
Two more lawmakers — Sen. Lindsey Graham and Rep. Ralph Norman — opted to forgo their pay entirely, instead donating it to charity. And two others did not respond to calls or emails from the SC Daily Gazette.
Under federal law, the president, Congress and federal judges all receive regular paychecks during shutdowns, unlike the 2 million civilian government employees and thousands of congressional staffers.
Members of Congress have the option to receive their pay as normal, donate it to charity, give the money back to the Treasury to buy down the federal debt, or have their checks withheld. They will get backpay when the shutdown ends, like other federal workers who don’t get an option.
Congress members’ base salary is $174,000 annually.
Pay withheld
In separate statements to the SC Daily Gazette, five of South Carolina’s Republicans on Capitol Hill said Congress should not get paid while federal employees and families across the country go without because of the ongoing stalemate. Those statements came from U.S. Reps. Sheri Biggs, Russell Fry, Nancy Mace, William Timmons and Joe Wilson on Tuesday, 12 days after federal workers missed their first full paycheck since the shutdown began Oct. 1.
“I’ve refused my paycheck during the shutdown because if our troops, border agents, and essential workers aren’t getting paid, I shouldn’t either,” said Biggs, whose conservative 3rd Congressional District spans 11 counties from Edgefield County on the Georgia border to the state’s northwest corner.
“Public service means putting others first, and I’ll always stand with the hardworking Americans who keep this country running,” she added in a statement.
Wilson pointed to his pledge on social media at the onset of the shutdown.
“A government shutdown is irresponsible,” he posted Oct. 1, noting he voted with Republicans on the stopgap spending bill that cleared the House. “In solidarity with those Americans who feel the financial hardships of this ill-advised vote, I will not accept my own government salary until this government shutdown is over.”
The 2nd District congressman said he’s followed through with that pledge.
Democrats and Republicans have pointed fingers, each blaming the other for not budging as the shutdown continues.
Republicans in the House passed a stopgap spending bill that keeps government running at current levels. Republicans in the Senate can’t pass that on their own because their narrow majority can’t reach the chamber’s required 60-vote threshold. The measure failed in the Senate for a 14th time Tuesday.
Democrats are holding out for a permanent extension of enhanced federal tax credits that buy down the cost of health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. Initially approved during the pandemic, those enhancements that make private health care affordable are set to expire Dec. 31. Republicans contend the government must open before those negotiations begin.
“While Senate Democrats play politics and hold the government hostage, Congresswoman Mace refuses to collect a dime until our troops and federal workers get the pay they’ve earned,” according to a statement from the coastal 1st District representative’s office. “She voted to keep the government open and won’t take her salary until theirs is restored.”
Active-duty military actually have continued to receive a paycheck. President Donald Trump ordered the U.S. Department of Defense to repurpose money to keep those dollars flowing — at least for now.
To make the troops’ most recent payday, the defense agency pulled $2.5 billion from a military housing fund included in Republican’s “One Big Beautiful” spending package passed earlier this year. In addition, $1.4 billion came from military research funds and another $1.4 billion came from an account that pays for the building of U.S. Navy ships.
A constitutional push
Graham and Norman, both Republicans, have each introduced a constitutional amendment in their chamber that would automatically do away with congressional pay in the case of any future shutdown.
Timmons, who represents the 4th District, and Fry, who represents the 7th District, also voiced support for the idea.
Congress has voted several times over the years to officially withhold members’ salaries during a shutdown, but none of the proposed have passed.
A measure to change the Constitution likely stands even less of a chance. The process requires two-thirds majority approval in each chamber, then approval by three-fourths of the states.
But in the meantime, both have pledged to donate their pay to charity.
Graham has said he will donate his salary to the Upstate Warrior Solution, which helps veterans and their families with needs such as housing and jobs.
Norman said he will make donations to the Children’s Attention Home, which helps foster children and homeless youth, and the Westminster Presbyterian Church Fund.
“If members of Congress had to forfeit their pay during government shutdowns, there would be fewer shutdowns and they would end quicker,” Graham said in a statement. “Not only should members of Congress not get paid during shutdowns, but the forfeited salaries should be used to pay down the federal debt.”
Norman, who is among five Republicans running for governor in 2026, called it “unconscionable” for politicians to get backpay during a shutdown.
“While hardworking Americans are tightening their belts, Congress shouldn’t be insulated from the very consequences it helped create,” the 5th District congressman said in a statement.
The church and the veterans’ charity declined to comment on how they would put the donations to use. The SC Daily Gazette was unable to reach the Children’s Attention Home for comment.

Older Coloradans are outpacing younger voters, with about 47% of ballots returned by people aged 65 or older. About 11% of ballots came from people between 18 and 34 years old.
Colorado has coordinated elections in odd-numbered years to decide statewide and local ballot issues and elect candidates for school boards, municipal offices and other local positions. This year, Colorado voters are deciding on two ballot measures, Propositions LL and MM, to provide more funding for the state’s universal school meals program.

(Photo courtesy of the Chesapeake Bay Program)Another tense showdown could be in the works between recreational fisherman and those who make a living on the waters off the Louisiana coast in the menhaden industry.
Members of Louisiana’s Finfish Task Force, an advisory panel for the state Wildlife and Fisheries Commission and other state agencies, met Thursday and unanimously recommended the state keep in place rules that limit how far commercial menhaden fishing vessels are kept from shore. 
The recommendation came in response to a request from the Wildlife and Fisheries Commission last month to explore changes to the menhaden buffer zone, a source of high controversy between sport fishers and the commercial fishing industry. 
Menhaden, also known as pogie, is a bony, oily fish used primarily to make pet food, fish oil supplements and fertilizer. Anywhere from 600 million to 900 million are caught annually in the Gulf of Mexico, making it the most harvested fish off the Louisiana coast.
The commission decided in 2024 to require menhaden fishers to keep at least a half-mile away from designated lines drawn around Louisiana’s coast. The rule was created to reduce spills of dead fish, protect marine habitat and reduce bycatch. Recreational anglers have been most concerned about the unintentional trapping of other species, such as speckled trout or redfish, in the nets of menhaden boats.
During the final minutes of its October meeting, the Wildlife and Fisheries Commission announced it would revisit the rule. What exact changes are under consideration has not been made public, though the expectation is some areas of the buffer zone could be reduced to allow commercial menhaden harvesting closer to the coast.
State biologist Jason Adriance said at the task force meeting that Wildlife and Fisheries Commission Chairman Kevin Segrera, a commercial alligator and fur hunter, directed the department to “review some historical industry fishing grounds” and consider modifying the buffer zone with those areas of the coast in mind. 
“The directive was to get with industry [and] review some areas of historical significance,” Adriance said, without specifying the locations. 
Adriance said he has received input from commercial fishermen, recreational anglers and the public about the buffer zone. This information has been provided to the Wildlife and Fisheries Commission, which will consider whether to update the menhaden fishing rules when it meets Thursday.
Task force members questioned the need to update the buffer rules, which were approved last year through a hard-fought compromise between sport fishers and the menhaden industry. 
“We just put in a half-mile buffer. We wanted a one-mile buffer, [but we] made a compromise. Everybody was OK with the compromise,” said Task Force member David Alphonso, representing the Louisiana Charter Boat Association. 
Task force chairman Benjamin Graham and member George Huye, representing the Louisiana Coastal Conservation Association, both said there are minimal regulations in place for the menhaden industry, and that justifies keeping the half-mile buffer zone in place. 
“For 80 years, they had essentially zero regulation,” Graham. 
There is a percentage limit on the amount of bycatch menhaden harvesters are allowed based on their total catch. But because there are no limits on how much menhaden they can net, Huye said the bycatch provision is a fluid number. 
“If you have an unlimited total, then that 5% is a number that can move with every year,” he said.
Should the Wildlife and Fisheries Commission approve changes to the menhaden regulations, a public comment period would open after publication in the December state register, which Adriance said would likely remain open until Jan. 23, for more feedback on the proposal. The commission would then take the comments into consideration before a final vote on the changes.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/MenhadenDetailChesapeakeBayProgram-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-04 19:02:23.917396

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Sierra Club Iowa Chapter is calling on a legislative committee to conduct a review of the impacts a 2022 law, which allowed some stores to opt out of providing redemption services, has had on the state’s can and bottle redemption program. 
Prior to the enactment of Senate File 2378, all stores that sold alcoholic or carbonated beverages, and collected the 5-cent deposit, had to accept the empty containers and redeem the deposit. 
Sierra Club, in a news release, said the law has made it “harder for Iowans to participate in the program.”

A 2024 Sierra Club survey found 62% of respondents reported a redemption center or collection site had closed in their area and 21% of respondents said they travel in excess of 10 miles to redeem their cans and bottles. 
Overall, 60% of Iowans surveyed said they find it harder to redeem cans and bottles since the change. 
The law allows stores that sell and charge the 5-cent beverage container deposit to opt out of redeeming the containers if they: are in counties with a population of 30,000 people or more and with 10 miles of another redemption center, in a county of fewer than 30,000 people and within 15 miles of a redemption center, have an agreement for an approved mobile redemption center on site, or hold food establishment licenses. 
The Iowa Department of Natural Resources has a list of redemption sites on its website and early this year, the Iowa Beverage Association launched an interactive map to help Iowans find their closest redemption location.
While many Iowans in the Sierra Club survey reported difficulties complying with the program, 94% responded they think the state should continue the program, which was enacted in 1979 and helps bottling materials go through proper recycling channels.
According to a state report from 2022, about 49% of beverage containers are recovered, though this statistic reflects containers returned to a redemption site and those picked up via curbside recycling.
In its 2024 survey, Sierra Club called for greater enforcement of the redemption laws and to increase the number of redemption sites in the state. The club also called for an increase in the redemption amount from 5 cents to 10 cents per container and to include juice, water bottles, iced tea and sports drinks in the program. 
The environmental club then also called for a “thorough review” from the Legislative Fiscal Review Committee, “immediately following the 2025 legislative session.” 
According to the committee’s online schedule, it has not met since 2019. Senate Democrats’ staff confirmed in an email the committee has not met on the bottle redemption topic and that there is no meeting set currently. 
Chairs of the committee, Rep. Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, and Sen. Tim Kraayenbrink, R-Fort Dodge, did not respond Tuesday to a request for comment. 
The 2022 law stipulated the committee hold a meeting during the legislative interim “immediately preceding the 2026 regular legislative session” to review the provisions of the law. The law instructs the committee to submit a report to the General Assembly no later than Jan. 31, 2026. The 2026 legislative session is set to begin Jan. 12.
Jess Mazour with Sierra Club Iowa Chapter said in the news release the group wants to “expand” the redemption program and “make it more accessible” for Iowans.
“We hope the Legislative Fiscal Review Committee will hold their meeting soon so we can get to work improving the popular and important program,” Mazour said in the news release. “It’s time to schedule the meeting now so they can do a thorough review and not violate Iowa law.”

Another BPS educator, who serves as a special education coordinator, had three fourth-graders who couldn’t read at all. He thinks about what could have been different: “If they had received the right help early on, they would have been able to engage with their learning instead of falling behind.”
A multilingual educator from Fitchburg with nearly 30 years of experience has seen firsthand what happens when students don’t receive this instruction. “Many students get passed from grade to grade and fall further behind, until dropping out becomes a serious possibility,” said the instructor. 
Stories like these are all too familiar to teachers across Massachusetts, and they explain why last week’s unanimous passage of the Right to Read Act by the Massachusetts House of Representatives is such a historic moment. For the first time, our state is on the verge of ensuring that every K-3 classroom uses high-quality, evidence-based reading materials and that teachers have the training and support they’ve been asking for.  
Sadly, victory did not come easily. For years, legislative proposals to strengthen reading instruction stalled amid competing perspectives on what’s best for students. But in the end, lawmakers in the House chose to side with teachers who are unequivocally calling for change — those who know, from the front of the classroom, that evidence-based literacy instruction works.
Across the Commonwealth, nearly 4 in 10 third-graders can’t read proficiently, with even deeper inequities for low-income students and students of color. In places like Lowell, where only 25 percent of third-graders could read at grade level in 2023, this bill would provide real tools, support, and standards to help teachers shift away from ineffective curricula that the state has already identified as “low quality.” 
Research tells us that 95 percent of students can learn to read by the third grade when given the right instruction. The Right to Read Act brings us within reach. 
As a former teacher, I’m often wary of top-down policies. But teachers across our state have consistently told me they want materials and strategies backed by research that will help their students succeed. In a recent snap poll by my organization, Educators for Excellence, 83 percent of teachers we surveyed support the use of high-quality, evidence-based instructional materials. 
“Reading was what lifted me out of poverty,” says an educator from Randolph who has taught for 23 years. “I want the same for every child.”
This is not about politics or preferences–it’s about ensuring our kids are not left further behind. Arguments that suggest we must choose between structure and flexibility miss the point entirely. What teachers want is both: the freedom to meet their students’ needs and the assurance that the materials, and supports necessary for teaching them, work.
The bill passed by the House last week strikes that balance beautifully. It allows districts to petition to use curricula not included on the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s evidence-based list, provided they can clearly demonstrate alignment in practice and results with approved programs. This ensures accountability while grounding solutions in what is actually improving literacy outcomes. The approach keeps teacher expertise at the center while setting a high bar for quality–exactly what educators have been asking for.
Now, the focus turns to the Massachusetts Senate. Senators should follow the House’s lead and resist efforts to weaken or delay this legislation. This is a rare moment in the Commonwealth, when the Speaker, Senate president, and governor have all voiced a similar commitment to addressing literacy outcomes for Massachusetts students. The Senate now has an opportunity to finish what the House started and get the bill to the governor’s desk. 
Teachers are ready. The research is clear. The students are waiting. The Senate must act swiftly in advancing a strong Right to Read Act, ensuring that every child across Massachusetts has the chance–and ability–to read. 
As one educator put it best: “We have a moral obligation to make sure every child gets instruction based on what we know works.”

So has supply.,"The community fridge at Reunity Resources in Santa Fe. Amid federal SNAP uncertainty, the fridge has seen twice as much demand. Community members are stepping up to re-fill it twice as fast, too, said Reunity Resources’ program manager Juliana Ciano. (Courtesy Juliana Ciano)The community fridge at Reunity Resources, a sustainable farm in Santa Fe, first opened in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s provided about 850 meals a month since then, open 24 hours a day for families to discretely grab fresh produce from the farm and other donated groceries.
The demand for the fridge has doubled over the last couple of weeks, said Juliana Ciano, program director at Reunity, amid an abrupt halt to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. 
These days, the three refrigerators full of food regularly empty within six hours, she said.

But just as quickly as they empty, Ciano said she’s been heartened to see the fridges fill again.
“It’s a testament to the idea of mutual aid,” she told Source New Mexico in a phone interview. “People are doing all of that, donating more money, donating more food, to keep it filling. But it’s also emptying quickly, for sure.”
New Mexico has roughly 460,000 SNAP recipients. About 17,000 of them are in Santa Fe County, according to state Health Care Authority data. Thanks to an emergency appropriation from state lawmakers and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, the state paid $30 million over the weekend to cover about 10 days’ worth of food assistance. 
But food assistance for the rest of the month remains uncertain amid the federal government shutdown. Officials at the United States Department of Agriculture said Monday they would comply with a pair of recent federal rulings ordering the agency to release about $4.5 billion in partial SNAP benefits. 
However, President Donald Trump on Tuesday backtracked from that promise, announcing on social media that benefits “will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!”
Las Cruces food agency’s clientele swells amid SNAP uncertainty 

In the meantime, lines at food bank distributions across the state have sharply increased, with demand resembling the early days of the pandemic, food bank leaders have told Source. The state is also pushing out roughly $8 million to food banks that lawmakers approved during the recent special legislative session.
The community fridge is a small piece of the puzzle, Ciano said, but an important one. Unlike lining up at food bank distributions, families can visit the fridges anonymously, free from the “stigma of hunger.” It also strengthens a sense of community, providing neighbors a way to help each other in uncertain times, she said.
“It allows people to bridge the gap,” she said. “We don’t look at the fridge as like the primary solution for everybody, but as a gap-filler for many.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/JPEG-image-488A-B1E3-33-0-e1762297748740.jpeg,,,2025-11-04 18:16:47.819762

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
Vermont’s Beta Technologies made its debut in the public market on Tuesday, selling $1 billion in a high-demand stock offering that exceeded earlier predictions for its size and pricing.
“The market responded incredibly well,” founding CEO Kyle Clark said in a press conference from the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday following the company’s 34 million share offering at $34 a share. “It’s obviously a huge day for us down here.”
Clark’s company indicated last month that it intended to offer just 25 million shares in a price range of between $27 and $33 each in its offering, but eventually issued more shares that started trading just above the projected price due to demand. When the stock market closed on Tuesday, Beta’s share price had increased about 6% to $36.

Beta, which employs more than 800 people, filed for an initial public offering in late September. The company, which designs and manufactures electric aircraft, has raised over $1.5 billion in private investment and development contracts since its founding in 2017. Clark’s business also recently announced a $300 million equity investment from GE Aerospace, with whom Beta will work to advance hybrid flight technology.
The company lost a U.S. Department of Energy grant earlier this month, as President Donald Trump’s administration sought to claw back funding from over 200 federally-assisted energy projects. 
In the context of Beta’s other contracts, the roughly $1.8 million grant was a relatively small loss, with Clark saying broadly on Tuesday that “we have seen little to no negative impact by any political party or movement.”
Market reports estimate Beta’s market value is around $7.6 billion, with Tuesday’s influx of capital paving the way for “further commercialization,” according to Clark. As the founder, he will retain ownership of a small percentage of the company, with GE Aerospace and Amazon among the largest investors.
Beta’s initial public offering comes in what Lynn Martin, President of the New York Stock Exchange, called a “really strong” moment for the U.S. IPO market last month. This positive outlook came despite a prolonged federal government shutdown that has left the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with limited staff.
The company’s October filing with the SEC contained descriptions of the company’s future products, including several versions of the six-person “ALIA” electric aircraft. Beta is also developing a larger 19-passenger plane.
The company opened a 188,500-square-foot production facility in South Burlington in 2023 and also runs a battery testing site in St. Albans. Clark said Tuesday that Beta’s consolidation of resources and engineering talent in Vermont has been key to the company’s success, and he plans to keep the company based in Vermont for the time being.
“We’re still at a very nascent time of electric aviation, where the engineering and the technical brain trust has to be very close to the production,” Clark said. 
Beta is investing further in Vermont right now, he added, with the goal of increasing the company’s “vertical integration,” or control of each section of the supply chain.
“We will hit a limit at some point,” Clark said of his operation’s footprint in the state. “We have to be a competitive business.”
Clark said the company had been offered “hundreds of millions of dollars” to move its main operations to Texas, or Arkansas or elsewhere. 
“We decided to stay in Vermont for now,” he said.
Chuck Davis, chair of Beta’s board of directors, said demand for the company’s shares far outstripped supply. Nonetheless, Clark said, the roughly 1,000 Vermonters who requested shares as part of the initial public offering process will receive them, in a gesture of good will toward “folks locally who have supported us as we expanded.”
Davis, who grew up in Burlington, said Beta’s expansion has been hugely beneficial for the state through economic growth, job creation and technological innovation. 
“It’s the best thing to happen to Vermont since the chair lift,” he said.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Smithfield school officials say they know what happened in the boys’ locker room at the high school on Sept. 30.
But they did not share many details with the few hundred people who waited while the Smithfield School Committee met for three hours behind closed doors at a special meeting at the high school Monday night. 
The committee members emerged from executive session to vote unanimously to hire the law firm of the school’s legal counsel, Sean Clough, to investigate the district’s response to the incident involving five seniors who were suspended, then un-suspended, after being accused of hazing a freshman football player and lobbing antisemitic barbs his way. Clough served six years on the School Committee, four as its chairperson.
Reports of the incident provoked outrage across social media over the past month, and drew condemnation and concerns from public officials including Gov. Dan McKee, Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos, and Sen. David Tikoian, the Democrat who represents the Smithfield in the Rhode Island Senate. U.S. Reps. Seth Magaziner and Gabe Amo also spoke up.
“When cruel and hateful actions happen in a school environment, we expect school and district leadership to conduct a thorough investigation and to take action consistent with the findings,” McKee and state education commissioner Angélica Infante-Green said in an Oct. 28 post on X.
The case is also being investigated as a civil matter by the office of Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha. The parents of the student, who has not been named, reported the incident to the AG as well as Smithfield Police. 
Committee Chair Richard Iannitelli gave the audience only a brief summary of the event.     
“It did take place in the boys’ locker room, football locker room, and it involved some of the students on the football team,” Committee Chair Richard Iannitelli said after the committee’s closed session with Superintendent Dawn Bartz.  
“Whether you want to call it hazing, or whether you want to call it bullying or a prank or a tradition, it makes no difference. What happened to the young adult in that room should not have happened.”
Iannitelli did not label the incident “antisemitism” in his remarks. When asked why by a reporter, he said, “At this point, I’m not gonna make a comment on that.”
Sitting right in front of him, occupying the first few rows in the auditorium’s center, were Jewish community leaders. The Jewish Alliance of Greater Rhode Island and the Sandra Bornstein Holocaust Education Center became involved with the case in early October at the invitation of Bartz.

The five seniors allegedly trapped the freshman student, who is Jewish, in a locker room bathroom before spraying at him through the door’s grate with Lysol. Simultaneously, they’re alleged to have flung antisemitic barbs at him. The claims were initially reported by WPRI-12 on Oct. 9 after the news outlet had obtained a letter from Bartz to the school community which alerted people that an investigation was ongoing. The matter was then further publicized by the Jewish Alliance, who had been contacted and informed by the parents.   
Bartz joined the committee Monday, with Clough by her side. She did not speak publicly until the meeting ended around 10 p.m. to reaffirm her and the school’s commitment to the investigation and the community. 
“Unfortunately, there’s been some information and facts and details around this incident that we have not been able to share due to privacy,” Bartz said.
At first, advocates were pleased when Bartz called on them after the Sept. 30 incident. The seniors received Holocaust education and were suspended on Oct. 10. But the students successfully appealed their suspension to the superintendent and were reinstated on Oct. 22, allowing the players to finish out the last five games of their high school careers. 
A handful of parents, mostly mothers of football players, outside the auditorium before the meeting began, handed out a double-sided, one-page flyer authored by “many parents of past and present athletes with firsthand knowledge of the locker room environment.” The flyer asserted that the bathroom where the episode occurred has been a hazing site “for over a decade” — a habitual practice, rather than an abnormal one.
Neither side’s interpretation of the incident found full vindication in the meeting. After a more than three-hour executive session, the School Committee voted unanimously to  hire the Providence law firm where Clough works, Brennan Scungio & Kresge, to conduct the probe.
Little of the committee’s lengthy executive session could be shared with the public Monday because of the AG’s investigation, Iannitelli said.
Still, Iannitell said, the night’s discussion could “try to thread the needle. Obviously an incident occurred.”
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Iannitelli said the committee is “pretty confident as to what happened” but would probe how the district handled the incident and its aftermath, including discipline and the appeal that reversed it. 
“When the investigation is done, the parts that can be released will be released,” he said.

‘What a joke!’
The five committee members left the room at 5:35 p.m., five minutes after the meeting began. Iannitelli did not reappear until around 8:13 p.m., and told the crowd the the committee was “close” to returning. He predicted another half hour before the meeting resumed in public.  
In the rows of olive seats a man stood up and shouted, “What a joke!” 
“You should know by now!” came another voice from the crowd.
Around 8:45 p.m., the full committee and Clough returned to the stage. Bartz returned a few minutes later but did not face the audience. She did, however, appear to take notes throughout much of the 75 minutes of public comment. 
The five-minute limit for comments was not enforced. The vast majority of comments came from Jewish people who expressed their shock and displeasure with how the process had been carried out. 
“Imagine he was told that there wasn’t going to be the problem of him having to see these other boys who did this to him because they were suspended,” Rabbi Jeffrey Gladstone said of the Jewish freshman student. “Imagine how he felt on the day that he got back to football practice and those boys were there.”
The rabbi excoriated Iannitelli for his reluctance to use the word “antisemitism” in his remarks: “If you can’t say the word antisemitism in addressing this crowd under these circumstances, then I would suggest we still have a problem.” 
Gary Rabinowitz, who said he is a grandson of Holocaust survivors, agreed and said, “When you came out of the executive committee and how you danced around using the word antisemitism — that was really difficult to hear. That was embarrassing.”
Rabinowitz was one of the several members of the public who criticized the flyer that suggested the incident was ordinary team antics; he called it an “abomination.” 
Ann Frank Goldstein, a Smithfield resident, said she hadn’t planned to speak but felt compelled by the document’s appeal to normality. 
“My parents used to say, ‘Wrong is wrong, even if everyone is doing it,’” Goldstein said. “‘And right is right, even if no one is doing it.’”

‘Smithfield football family’
No parents came to the podium to speak. Occasionally, their commentary erupted from the seats, with the shouts correlated to sections of the audience decked out in Smithfield’s scholastic palette of green.
The paper distributed by parents outside the auditorium contained many more protestations. One side of the paper had statements rendered as all-caps word art, proclaiming “FACTS BEFORE HEADLINES” or “HEARSAY ISN’T EVIDENCE.” The other side of the paper, also all-caps, sported a bulleted list of “the facts,” and forcefully rejected the notion the “Smithfield football family” was antisemitic or prejudiced in any way. 
It also stated: “PAST AND PRESENT ATHLETES REPORT BEING BLOCKED IN THE BATHROOM FOR ALL FOUR YEARS OF THEIR ATTENDANCE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR ATHLETIC ABILITY, RACE, RELIGION, OR PERCEIVED POPULARITY,” adding that the behavior is not condoned and alleges that the school principal has since removed the door from the bathroom.
The speaker who defended the seniors most fiercely was Dr. Andrew Bostom, who is Jewish and an Islam-critical scholar of antisemitism.
“No more locker room antics, please,” he said. “But I am far more concerned that we be completely accurate before leveling charges of quote-unquote targeted antisemitic slurs at 17 year-old man-children football players.”
Bostom continued: “A month after the alleged incident, not a shred of hard evidence — video, audio — in this age of ubiquitous recording devices, has been produced to prove the claim that…antisemitic slurs were hurled during the stupid locker room antics.” 
Bostom’s comments elicited a few cheers from people in the crowd. Sitting next to Bostom was Gregory Piccirilli, an attorney who said he is representing the families of the accused football players. A nine-minute video posted to X Monday night by Bostom showcases Piccirilli’s conversation with two broadcast reporters in the school’s hallway. 
In the video, Piccirilli denied any antisemitic motive and repeatedly described the episode as typical locker room or as “camaraderie” and “team building.” 
“I wouldn’t go so far as to call it hazing,” Piccirilli said, adding that the incident lasted maybe 90 seconds. Meanwhile, he said that when one of the seniors was a freshman, he “had been locked in a bathroom for 45 minutes.”  
Piccirilli did not respond to a request for a follow-up comment on Tuesday. His comments to reporters on Monday conveyed his belief that the incident had turned into a spectacle. He refused to characterize the incident as bullying because he did not find it germane. 
“We’re here because of the charges of antisemitism,” he said to reporters. “You’re not here because of bullying, are you? No.”
Piccirilli argued that the Jewish student — “the young boy who was a victim, if you want to call him that” — needs his privacy protected, too.

Federal courts have ruled that the White House is required to distribute federal food aid under the program, despite the continuing government shutdown. The Trump administration has said it will send money to states to fund roughly half of payments, after previously pausing benefits Nov. 1, though remarks by the president Tuesday raised questions on whether they will continue to do so.
NC Department of Health and Human Services is “updating its payment system” this week, the department said Tuesday, and is expecting partial payments to be loaded onto EBT cards “by next week.”
“While we are encouraged by the decision to require the use of emergency funds, the fact that families will receive only partial benefits, is troubling,” NC DHHS Secretary Dev Sangvai said in a statement. “Food is foundational to health, dignity, and opportunity. We must focus on the people we serve and ensure that programs like SNAP are protected from further disruption.”
Around 1.4 million North Carolinians are enrolled in SNAP. At the beginning of November, more than 60% of participants had $25 or less on their EBT cards, according to the department. More than 30% had less than $1.
SNAP participants may not receive exactly half of their normal allotment, however; “the actual amount also depends on each household’s income,” the department said.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — New statements from State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst revealed more details from his perspective about an alleged groping of a woman attending an end-of-session gathering earlier this year.
The statements also sought to add more context to his apology letter to the alleged victim that McKeon sent on July 28. Some of McKeon’s fellow lawmakers criticized the letter as a “non-apology” that made excuses for bad behavior.
“I’m deeply sorry for my actions at the end of session when we were visiting that offended you. I was saying it in a joking manner, and I know that alcohol had some influence but that’s no excuse,” McKeon wrote in the letter.

The Nebraska State Patrol cited McKeon last week for misdemeanor “public indecency” after investigating the allegation by a woman attending a post-legislative session party May 29.
In the Patrol report, a woman reported McKeon “made inappropriate contact with her buttocks with his hand, over the top of her clothing,” a Nebraska State Patrol spokesman told the Examiner.
The Examiner obtained a copy of McKeon’s letter from Kathleen Neary, the attorney representing the woman making the allegation. Her name and address are redacted. The Examiner is aware of the woman’s name but is not publishing it because it is the policy of States Newsroom and the Examiner not to identify people who say they have been abused unless they wish to talk publicly.
She has so far declined to comment through her lawyer.
State Sen. John Fredrickson, a Democrat from Omaha, said McKeon’s letter felt like a “non-apology,” based on his first sentence that apologized to the staffer for actions that “offended” her.
“The other thing that I think is just obviously glaring in (the letter) is that he shrouds himself in God while apologizing for groping another person without consent,” Fredrickson said. “I think the irony of that is pretty clear to anyone who reads that.”
State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha — a progressive nonpartisan — shared similar thoughts with the Examiner, calling McKeon’s refusal to resign “disgraceful.”
“Public officials don’t get to redefine sexual misconduct as a spiritual trial. It’s a breach of trust, and it undermines the dignity of the Legislature,” Hunt said.
McKeon denied the allegations in separate statements Monday and Tuesday by his attorney Perry Pirsch. Pirsch described the incident as “light-hearted exchange” and called the allegations “politically motivated.”
Neary responded to Pirsch’s Monday statement Tuesday, saying that if McKeon files a countersuit for defamation — an idea Pirsch mentioned — “he will be met with a vigorous defense, including a request for sanctions for filing a frivolous counterclaim.”
“Following a thorough investigation, the Nebraska State Patrol determined that Senator McKeon had engaged in misconduct consistent with the criminal act of public indecency,” Neary’s statement reads. “His failure to take personal responsibility for his lewd misconduct and his despicable attempt to defame the victim clearly demonstrates that he lacks the personal integrity required of elected officials in Nebraska.”

On Tuesday, McKeon and Pirsch offered more details about McKeon’s perspective on the incident. Pirsch said McKeon “made a single remark — a joke — to a staff member about her planned trip and hoping she and her husband would receive a ‘Hawaiian lei,’ or words to that effect, and he then patted her on the back.”
“It was meant in jest and nothing about his action was in any way sexually charged or lewd, just a bad pun,” Pirsch said in the statement.
Gov. Jim Pillen and other state officials have called for McKeon’s resignation, but McKeon’s latest statement said he will not resign.
“I have taken responsibility for attempting humor in the wrong moment and tone. I am sorry for that. But I did not engage in sexual misconduct, much less public lewd fondling or caressing. Most of my constituents enjoy my sense of humor,” McKeon said in Tuesday’s statement.
“Senator McKeon’s main dispute appears to be with Governor Pillen and his call for McKeon’s resignation,” Neary said in an email Tuesday. “As for my client’s dispute with Senator McKeon, I look forward to a jury rendering a fair and just verdict after they have heard all of the evidence.”
Roughly half of McKeon’s apology is filled with Bible verses, which he explained was meant to help “understand forgiveness.”
“God is still working on me, and I know he is here for all of us. God bless and hope your summer is going well,” McKeon wrote to end the letter.
McKeon is a registered Republican who was elected to the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Legislature in 2024, replacing former State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul. McKeon’s biographical page on the Nebraska Legislature’s website highlights that he has been married for 30 years and has four children.
The Examiner reached out to several Republican lawmakers for comment Tuesday, none of which immediately responded.
Fredrickson expressed concern that if McKeon does not resign before the next legislative session begins in January, his presence could disrupt lawmakers’ 60-day session. Considering the allegations connote sexual violence, he said having “someone like that” in a workplace is risky and potentially dangerous.
“No one working in the Nebraska Legislature should have to worry about being touched without consent,” Hunt said. “When a senator does that and then excuses it as a joke, or blames alcohol, or hides behind religion, he tells every staffer and member of the public that the rules don’t apply to him.”

(Photo courtesy of the Arkansas Attorney General's office)The attorney general rejected for a second time Tuesday a proposed constitutional amendment to grant Arkansans the right to a clean and healthy environment. 
University of Arkansas students drafted the Clean and Healthy Natural Environment Amendment, which proposes amending the state’s constitution to preserve “the outdoors and natural resources for Arkansans’ recreation, economy, and public health.”
If approved, the Legislature would be required to make laws to implement and enforce the measure. The proposed amendment would also repeal “all inconsistent state laws.”
University students seek to safeguard Arkansas’ natural resources through ballot initiative

In Tuesday’s four-page opinion, prepared by Assistant Attorney General William Olson, Attorney General Tim Griffin said he could not certify the measure because the text of the proposed amendment once again prevented him from ensuring the ballot title was not misleading or substituting a more appropriate ballot title. 
Griffin noted that the proposed measure places certain duties on “government entities,” but it’s unclear who would have these duties. The attorney general also said the amendment lacks clarity about the “fundamental right” it would create.
“It is unclear what obligations are placed upon ‘governmental entities’ and the legislature in enforcing a ‘fundamental right to a clean and healthy natural environment,’” Griffin wrote. 
Additional issues with the measure, according to Griffin, include a lack of clarity of how the proposed amendment would impact other laws, partisan coloring in the popular name and inconsistent provisions.
Kevin Durden, a UA sophomore and one of the drafters of the measure, was undeterred by Griffin’s opinion.
“While we are disappointed by the decision from the Attorney General’s office, we look forward to the opportunity to revise and resubmit,” he said in a text message Tuesday afternoon.
Durden was inspired to pursue the amendment after reading about a group of young Montantans who successfully sued the state over laws they argued violated their right to a clean and healthy environment, which is guaranteed in Montana’s constitution. A judge ruled in favor of the young Montanans in 2023, and the Montana Supreme Court upheld the decision in December.
Three UA juniors joined Durden in crafting their initial proposal, which they submitted in September with the assistance of Jennifer Waymack Standerfer, a Bentonville attorney who’s providing her services to the students pro bono. 
Griffin rejected their initial submission on Oct. 3 because he said problems with the proposed amendment’s text prevented him from ensuring the ballot title was not misleading or substituting a more appropriate ballot title.
If the attorney general eventually approves their proposal, the students can then begin gathering the requisite number of signatures to place their measure on the 2026 ballot. Constitutional amendments require 90,704 signatures from at least 50 of the state’s 75 counties, according to the secretary of state’s office.

Members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation this week urged the U.S. Department of Agriculture not to greatly increase Argentine beef imports, saying it would hurt New Mexico cattle ranchers. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)President Donald Trump’s plan to greatly increase the nation’s importation of beef from Argentina will hurt New Mexico’s cattle ranchers at an already difficult time, New Mexico’s three U.S. House members said in a letter this week to the federal Agriculture Department secretary.
The Trump administration recently announced the administration’s plan to quadruple the amount of Argentine beef it imports, an attempt to lower nationwide beef prices, according to Reuters. The news followed a $20 billion currency swap deal with Argentina that Democrats have blasted as a “bailout” of the country’s right-wing president. 
U.S. Reps. Gabe Vasquez, Teresa Leger Fernández and Melanie Stansbury, all New Mexico Democrats, said Trump’s reported plan to increase Argentine beef exports from 20,000 metric tons to 80,000 metric tons will undercut New Mexico cattle ranchers on the cusp of their first good year in a long time. 
“From years of drought to soaring input costs, New Mexico’s ranchers have barely turned a profit,” the delegation wrote in the Monday letter to Secretary Brooke Rollins. “This plan to flood the market with foreign beef will take money out of the pockets of New Mexico’s ranchers with questionable benefits to consumers.”

The letter cites a USDA analysis from August showing that New Mexico ranchers’ sale of about 1.3 million cattle and calves contributed $1.7 billion to the state economy in 2023, the most recent available data. 
“Ranching is not just a job, it’s a way of life in our rural communities,” the lawmakers wrote. “New Mexico’s ranchers deserve a federal government that looks out for them rather than one that gives a handout to foreign producers.”
According to a USDA September price outlook, cattle prices reached record highs in August and September, with slaughter steers now selling for more than $240 per 100 lbs, a $54 increase over last year.
Another factor driving up beef prices is the halt of cattle imports from Mexico, roughly half of which come through New Mexico ports of entry. The border has been closed to Mexican cattle imports since July due to fears about a New World screwworm, a parasitic fly. 
The lawmakers said Trump should halt any plans to increase Argentine beef imports and should instead go after “price gouging” in the meatpacking industry. They pointed to a recent $87.5 million settlement two of the nation’s largest meatpacking companies reached last month over accusations they inflated meat prices by restricting supply, Reuters reported. 
The House members’ letter is the second rebuke from New Mexico’s congressional delegation. U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján, also Democrats, issued a similar statement Oct. 28.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_6213-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-04 18:01:20.107950

(Photo by Irving Police Department)TOPEKA — The former CEO of the Texas company that was granted a unique bank charter on orders of the Kansas Legislature was arrested and jailed Tuesday following indictment for an alleged scheme to loot more than $150 million from a company forced into bankruptcy.
Brad Heppner, who was taken into custody at his home by the Irving Police Department, was indicted in federal court in the Southern District of New York on counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud, making false statements to auditors, and falsification of records.
He has been at the center of a flurry of civil lawsuits for years alleging financial misconduct.
Heppner is accused in the indictment of extracting tens of millions of dollars from now-bankrupt GWG Holdings through a series of misrepresentations and self-serving transactions tied to Highland Consolidated Limited Partnership. He was simultaneously chairman of GWG and Beneficient, and secretly controlled HCLP, according to the indictment.
“Though Heppner repeatedly described HCLP as an independent entity, it was, in fact, a shell company controlled by Heppner and operated for his benefit,” the indictment said. “Once Heppner exhausted his ability to siphon GWG’s assets for himself, he separated himself from GWG. GWG filed for bankruptcy shortly thereafter, causing losses exceeding $1 billion to thousands of investors and bondholders.”
The financial damage resulting from the catastrophe at GWG primarily fell on retail investors, “many of them retirees,” the indictment says.
The indictment says Heppner used the money for personal expenses, including $40 million for renovation of a Dallas mansion and a ranch in Montalba, Texas. He allegedly spent $10 million on upkeep, expansion and IT services on those properties as well as $10 million on credit card debt and private aviation expenses. He purportedly used $20 million to pay tax expenses and bought more than $500,000 worth of jewelry.
The indictment seeks to force Heppner to surrender ill-gotten cash as well as the properties in Dallas and Montalba.
In June, Heppner resigned from Dallas-headquartered Beneficient rather than cooperate with an audit committee looking into financial irregularities.
Dan Callahan, a spokesperson representing Beneficient, issued a company statement in wake of the indictment: “Beneficient parted ways with Mr. Heppner earlier this year, immediately after learning facts related to his alleged fraud on the company and others. Beneficient will continue to pursue its own claims against Mr. Heppner on behalf of its shareholders. Beneficient has and continues to cooperate with the government’s investigation of Mr. Heppner.”
Heppner was the face of Beneficient before and after it landed a Kansas banking charter for a Beneficient subsidiary.
Legislation that guaranteed Beneficient received the charter was championed by Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican now in the midst of a campaign for governor. Masterson made the motion in support of the charter during a 2021 interim legislative committee hearing. The legislation was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.
Beneficient made financial contributions to Republicans and Democrats in Kansas. It’s unclear whether those donations were made with cash Heppner took from GWG.
David Herndon, the state banking commissioner, opposed the charter for Beneficient and repeatedly urged the Legislature to repeal the law allowing Beneficient to anchor its asset-swap business to Kansas.
The business tied to the charter was designed to allow Beneficient to work with investors in illiquid assets to cash out or trade for stock those assets, including venture capital and private equity. To entice Kansas to deliver on the charter, Beneficient funneled money into a Kansas foundation that was to help revitalize Hesston and support economic development in other rural communities.

Haley Barbour and Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson are among the Mississippi political figures who say they appreciate the legacy of former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has died at age 84.","After Hurricane Katrina walloped south Mississippi in 2005, then-Vice President Dick Cheney was among the national leaders who traveled to the area to assess damage, and he was instrumental in helping the state secure federal money for recovery, Republican former Gov. Haley Barbour said Tuesday.
Cheney died Monday night of complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, his family said. He was 84.
Barbour and Democratic U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson are among the Mississippi political figures who say they appreciate the legacy of Cheney, who is widely considered one of the most powerful vice presidents in U.S. history.
Barbour was governor from 2004 to 2012, overlapping with most of the Bush-Cheney terms from 2001 to 2009.

“He wasn’t loud, but he was strong … and he was a very nice man,” said Barbour, who was chairman of the Republican National Committee in the mid-1990s and served on the first Bush-Cheney national campaign committee in 2000.
Cheney has been a polarizing figure in Republican politics. Once a hero to the right, he fell out with the GOP in recent years as he criticized President Donald Trump.
After a heart transplant in 2012, Cheney remained politically active and was a frequent critic of President Barack Obama’s administration. But after initially endorsing Trump in 2016, Cheney had sharp words for the Trump administration and supported his own daughter, Republican U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, as she became a leading “never Trump” Republican. Dick Cheney later published a statement saying he would vote for the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, in the 2024 presidential election.
Cheney spent decades in government and politics, including as White House chief of staff for President Gerald Ford, congressman from Wyoming, secretary of defense and vice president. He was influential in Bush’s tax policies and rolling back environmental protections opposed by big businesses. He was a main architect of Bush’s “War on Terror” and invasion of Iraq after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
Thompson, Mississippi’s lone Democrat in Congress, is a former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. As chairman of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Thompson appointed Liz Cheney as vice chair.

“When I met Vice President Cheney, he personally thanked me for that decision and for the integrity with which the committee conducted its work, even at a time when many in his party chose not to participate in the one-year commemoration of January 6th,” Thompson said in a statement Tuesday. “Vice President Cheney’s legacy in shaping America’s national security will be remembered, and I extend my prayers to the Cheney family during this difficult time.”
Thompson said he worked with Cheney during creation of the Department of Homeland Security after 9/11.
“His leadership and support were invaluable as we brought together 22 federal agencies to form the Department of Homeland Security and strengthen our nation’s security,” Thompson said of Cheney.
Thompson also said Cheney’s death “saddens me deeply.”
Paul Hurst, an attorney who was Barbour’s gubernatorial chief of staff, said Tuesday that Cheney was “a great friend of Mississippi, and I was honored to work with him a few times.”
“He supported all of our recovery efforts after Katrina and advocated for others in DC to do the same,” Hurst said.

Barbour first worked for Ronald Reagan’s unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1976. After Ford fended off a challenge from Reagan at the Republican National Convention, Ford hired Barbour to run his campaign in seven Southern states.
“Cheney was very bright, but he was quiet,” Barbour told Mississippi Today in a call from his Washington office Tuesday. “He wasn’t loud. He spoke in short sentences. He was always very nice to me.
“When he got picked for vice president, I was on the George Bush national campaign committee,” Barbour said. “Cheney had for a while gotten out of politics at that time.”
Barbour said he remembers a letter he wrote after Bush and Cheney were elected that could have gotten him into hot water with the vice president.
“I wrote Cheney a letter about how we always said the Democrats, the Clinton administration, had kowtowed to the environmentalists, and that he and Bush and other Republicans said they were not going to do that any more,” Barbour said. “… I said, ‘Mr. Vice President, you have said this, and we want to see you back it up. Environmentalists are pushing bad policy that doesn’t do any good and just makes everything more expensive, so we are watching to see how you do.'”

A reporter “somehow got hold of the letter,” Barbour said, and he faced questions from his lobbying client, Southern Company, and apparently Cheney didn’t initially find the letter amusing.
“But Cheney thought the letter was funny after a while,” Barbour said. “He and I stayed friends long after that, and I have always had great admiration for him.”
Barbour said Bush, Cheney, their administration and Congress were a great help to Mississippi after Katrina. 
“We were blessed to have President Bush the younger, Dick Cheney, (U.S. Sen.) Thad Cochran at that time,” Barbour said. “We had a very supportive Congress, and Cheney was part of that. They bent over backwards to help Mississippi and other states.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/04161316/AP23047069499305.jpg,,,2025-11-04 18:01:20.107950

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)LEWISTOWN – Tariffs, the larger economic state of the country’s agricultural industry and revitalization of the state’s rural communities were all on the docket as the Montana Farmers Union held its annual convention.
The agricultural advocacy organization elected new officers last weekend, including the reelection of president Walter Schweitzer. Montana Farmers Union also recently hired a new executive director, Rachel Provest, who outlined her priorities as the country’s agricultural industry moves through uncertain waters.
Congressional candidate Matt Rains — a former chief of staff for the Montana Farmers Union — spoke during the event, as did former U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, who accepted an award from the organization.
The event also included focus on mental health, highlighted by singer Jason DeShaw who gave a keynote performance and spoke candidly about his struggles with mental health. Suicide rates in rural communties are high and Montana has ranked in the top five in suicide rates for the past forty years.
Economic winds have been swirling for farmers, as tariffs and high food prices have been a mixed bag. About 20% of small farms and ranches have disappeared during the last 10 years, Schweitzer said. The Montana Farmers Union has sought to advocate for small and mid-sized farming and ranching businesses, with their perspective that monopolistic businesses and corporations are harming small communities.
“We had flour mills in every big town,” Schweitzer said during an interview with the Daily Montanan. “We had packing plants in every big town. We had home delivery milk in every big town, and we had bakeries in every big town, and now we have none of that.”
Prevost, a Carroll College graduate who grew up near Lambert, spoke on the issue as well — the consolidation of small businesses is an issue the Farmer’s Union is looking to address.
“The Farmers Union has taken a really unique approach of looking at the whole local food system in terms of resiliency,” Prevost said during an interview with the Daily Montanan. “So that’s a huge focus we have, our focus on producer-owned co-ops. We’ve got the meat processing co-ops that have been developed. We’re actively looking at other opportunities to really kind of fortify resilient food systems.”
Prevost said other issues she’s focused on include country-of-origin labeling, farm and ranch succession planning, developmental pressures on farms, as well as data privacy.
“When we start looking at corporate monopolization and how that impacts market opportunities, and is there a level playing field?” Prevost said. “We don’t think there is.”

Prevost was involved in 4-H, Future Farmers of America and holds degrees in public relations, communications and political science from Carroll. She started working for the Farmers Union about five years ago, she said, adding it was Schweitzer who reached out to bring her into the organization.
Her family raised cattle and grew wheat, barley and hay.
“Right now feels very like a precipice of a point where, like, farmers and ranchers are like, we’re at the edge and so, you know, having grown up, like, really understanding the impacts of, ‘oh, we got hailed out,’ or we had hail damage, or grasshoppers, or whatever it may be, out in the field, sitting with a member, I can just be empathetic.”
The Farmers Union is also pushing for a new Farm Bill, which they hope will provide market fairness and help strengthen rural communities. The Farm Bill, which is a large collection of agricultural legislation, helps dictate the country’s agricultural policy. The nation’s food production relies on predictability and stability, which some agricultural organizations have said hasn’t been the case during President Donald Trump’s second presidency.
The current government shutdown has also started to impact farmers with Schweitzer saying financial assistance through the Agriculture Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage federal programs have caused some to see liens on their checks for loans they’ve already paid off.
“Right now, there’s a whole bunch of checks out there that are nothing but a piece of paper, because you can’t do anything with it,” Schweitzer said. “That’s a real impact.”
The Montana Farmers Union also elected new board members, including John Wicks from Ledger, who will serve a three-year term.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella is one of 39 state attorneys general asking Congress to close a loophole in the 2018 Farm Bill that has allowed marijuana-like hemp products to be sold as an unregulated product.
The attorneys general co-signed a letter to Congress last week, writing that “a provision of the 2018 Farm Bill … has been wrongly exploited by bad actors to sell recreational synthetic THC products across the country.” They argued that some have “nefariously misinterpreted” the bill’s new legal definition of “hemp.”
In the 2018 Farm Bill, Congress removed cannabis products that contain less than 0.3% THC, the main psychoactive compound in cannabis, from the legal definition of marijuana with the goal of boosting the agricultural industry. The idea was to give farmers a new product to sell: rope, textiles, and building materials made from industrial hemp, a product chemically similar to marijuana but nontoxicating. However, in doing so it legalized hemp-derived products with synthetic THC and the same intoxicating effect as marijuana. Or at least that’s how some have interpreted the bill. These hemp-derived products include Delta-8 and THC-0, which have exploded in availability in vape shops, gas stations, and online retailers.
The attorneys general want Congress to clarify the definition of hemp in the 2026 appropriations process “to leave no doubt that these harmful products are illegal and that their sale and manufacture are criminal acts.” They called them dangerous and argued the products, some of which look like candy or junk food, are “often packaged and sold in ways meant deliberately to appeal to children.”
Once illegal nationwide, conventional marijuana is now legal for recreational purposes in 24 states and for medicinal purposes in 40 states. In New Hampshire, marijuana remains illegal for recreational purchases, but is decriminalized and legal for medicinal purposes.
In August, Gov. Kelly Ayotte reaffirmed her opposition to legalizing recreational marijuana in New Hampshire, saying “my concerns are quality of life, the impact on the mental health of youth, and also (that) they can’t measure it when it comes to road safety.”
Formella, who serves as president of the National Association of Attorneys General, was appointed and confirmed as the state’s attorney general by former Gov. Chris Sununu in 2021. In August, Ayotte, Sununu’s immediate successor, reappointed him to a new term.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/formella-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-04 18:01:20.107950

(Photo courtesy of Ismael Collazo)On Wednesday morning at 6 a.m., Ismael Collazo of Brookings will board a plane for Washington, D.C., with plans to advocate for the programs he says put him in the position to buy tickets, board planes and advocate. 
Collazo, a former line cook at a Hard Rock Hotel in Florida, lost his vision 12 years ago. After a rough patch of depression and heavy drinking, he signed up for a vocational rehabilitation program that offered job and business training.
As a result, Collazo, who moved to South Dakota to be nearer to his wife’s family, has owned and operated his own business, a woodworking company called Blind Guy Boards, for the past six years. 
“I’ve learned how to be my own accountant, how to be my own maintenance, my own salesman, my own bookkeeper,” said Collazo, South Dakota state president for the National Federation of the Blind. “I do it all.”
The program that trained Collazo is administered by the state Department of Human Services, but is federally funded through the U.S. Department of Education.
That vocational rehabilitation program, designed for people who go blind as adults, is one of several under that department’s umbrella that Collazo sees as under dire threat.
The Trump administration issued an executive order to unwind the department earlier this year. During the ongoing government shutdown, the administration issued a “reduction in force” notice for the department that would reportedly remove most of the employees responsible for administering the programs.
Following through with the staffing threats would “decimate the workforce that runs the Department of Education,” Collazo said. 
“That’s what we’re fighting for: the what now?” he said. “These programs are mandated by law, so what happens to these programs?”
Staff cut proposals, blocked layoffs
The answers are unclear on several fronts.
The administration hasn’t released detailed lists of which employees in which areas of government could be impacted by the reductions in force the president first alluded to in a social media host on Oct. 2, although court filings have put the total number at about 4,200.
“I can’t believe the radical left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity,” Trump wrote.
Judge blocks Trump shutdown layoffs, citing political retribution

Labor unions have since sued the administration over the layoffs, and a California judge recently ordered the administration not to carry them out during the shutdown. 
An Oct. 10 court filing in that lawsuit from the federal government put the number of Education Department employees targeted for staff reductions at 466.
The administration’s lawyers have appealed, arguing that some layoffs were planned before the shutdown began and ought to be allowed to proceed.
Chris Danielsen, public relations manager for the National Federal of the Blind, said his organization’s volunteer leaders are acting under their understanding of the situation, which is a proposed staffing cut at the Education Department’s Office of Special Education Programs, the Rehabilitation Services Administration and Division of Civil Rights.
The first office funds services to blind students in K-12 schools. The second funds the vocational programming Collazo used, as well as training for elderly people who need help setting up their homes to safely stay in them after they experience age-related vision loss. The third offers an enforcement mechanism for families who say their children with disabilities haven’t received the federal services afforded them under federal law.
The national federation, Danielsen said, is one of several in the blind and disabled community to have sounded alarms and written letters about the changes.
Everyone who serves as a federation leader at the state level has been urged to touch base with their respective congressional delegations, Danielsen said, and to travel to Washington if they’re able.
He didn’t know exactly how many state-level advocates would show up to the U.S. Capitol alongside Collazo this week, but said the figure is in the dozens.
“Our organization is all volunteer-run, so people are going as they are able,” Danielsen said.
South Dakota funds available, for now 
The state Department of Human Services administers the vocational program funding and funding for the elderly. 
According to spokeswoman Kristen Kilmer, nothing has changed at this point at the Division of Service to the Blind and Visually Impaired.
The vocational program served 391 people between 2023 and 2024, according to that division’s most recent annual report. Of those, 52 were employed by the end of the program.
U.S. Education Department to cut hundreds of staff members

The elderly service program served 332 people, the report says. 
The two programs continue to operate at full capacity, she wrote, and serve “the same number of clients as before.”
The state got $2.7 million for vocational rehab last year, and Kilmer said more than half of that money is remaining and available for use though September of next year. The state “hasn’t gotten notice” of the money it might get from the federal government for federal fiscal year 2026, which began in October of this calendar year. 
The Independent Living Older Blind program gets $225,000 a year. The state doesn’t have leftover money, she said, and has covered the bill thus far, to the tune of $19,700.
“That will eventually be reimbursed” by the federal government, Kilmer said.
Danielsen, the spokesman for the national federation, said the continuing resolution to fund the government — which has been voted down numerous times in the U.S. Senate since the shutdown began — includes funding for programs for the visually impaired.
The funding won’t do much good, he said, without staff. 
“You can effectively kill a program if you get rid of the staff that run it and have no plan on how to run it going forward,” Danielsen said.
South Dakota advocate
That’s what Collazo is most concerned about, for himself and the approximately 19,000 other visually impaired people in South Dakota.
He said he would not have been able to open his business without the vocational program, and that the same is true of plenty of people who lose their sight as adults. 
In reality, he said, the programs save money for taxpayers by keeping people with visual impairments in the workforce and off government assistance.

Beyond vocational and elderly programming, he’s concerned about the Randolph-Sheppard program. Since 1936, that program has put visually impaired entrepreneurs in charge of businesses and federal buildings, often food service businesses. 
He intends to talk about all of it in meetings with the offices of South Dakota Republican Sens. Mike Rounds and John Thune on Wednesday, his first day in D.C.
He’s working with the office of Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson to set up a meeting, as well, but that will likely be back in South Dakota. Collazo plans to return Thursday.
He plans to talk to the elected officials about his journey from chef to blind woodworker, and about the independence he wasn’t sure he’d have a dozen years ago, when he lost his eyesight.
He’s produced cutting boards, countertops and even some cabinetry, with the help of tools like a click ruler, which makes sounds to indicate measurements, and saw stops, which have electronic detection systems and shutoff mechanisms to protect their users.
“You never know what you can accomplish until you’re put into a position where you have to,” Collazo said.
Other South Dakotans in such positions ought to have the same opportunity to learn how to push their limits, he said.

There was a jar of chili sauce, two onions, and some coffee creamer. 
How do you make a meal out of that? 
And yet that’s what we’re expecting the families who rely on food banks to do.  
This situation will only get worse with impending cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. That’s the federal program to help low-income people get groceries. The law known as H.R. 1, marketed as the Big Beautiful Bill, will take food off the tables of an estimated 170,000 children, veterans and families here in Washington.  
H.R. 1 will shift more costs of running the program to states, make work requirements stricter, eliminate an education program that helps people make healthy choices about diet and exercise, along with other moves that shave this safety net to the lowest funding level in its 50-year history. 
Those cuts are set to take place in 2026. But the government shutdown is creating uncertainty for SNAP now. Benefits were set to run out Nov. 1. Following court rulings last week, it now appears that the federal government could release at least a portion of the money needed to keep paying for the program, though details remain unclear.
Gov. Bob Ferguson has pledged $2.2 million a week in state funding to food banks to help with disruptions to SNAP. To the more than 900,000 families in Washington who use SNAP, that will mean they can still shop for groceries and make meals. Yet this is only a temporary fix for a larger problem.  
My congregation at Riverton Park Church in Tukwila has operated a food bank for more than 25  years to make sure our neighbors have enough to eat. We’ve welcomed them in — families,  singles, housed and unhoused, employed and unemployed — to pick up bread, meat, dairy, fresh produce, canned foods and staples like rice and potatoes.  
In the past, we’ve been able to provide up to 50 pounds of food per customer, which is enough to prepare several well-rounded, nutritious meals. Even during the pandemic, we were able to provide food for our community. These days, we only have enough for customers to come just once a week and take 15 pounds of food. It’s deeply disappointing to turn our neighbors away, knowing they will not have enough to make a meal.  
Over the years, state and federal government investments in food and nutrition programs haven’t kept pace with the dire need. Our suppliers, like Northwest Harvest and Food Lifeline, can’t deliver as much food to pantries like ours, and in turn, we can’t pass it on to those in need.  The result: more people going hungry.  
We know that more bad news is coming. To pay for tax cuts to the wealthy, Trump’s Congress is also slashing Medicaid. As many as 320,000 people in our state will lose access to health care because of it, according to state estimates. 
I’m already hearing of situations where our clients can’t afford care, and worry these will only become more frequent when the Medicaid changes kick in. Recently, a client went to the doctor because she had a stomachache. She was given a prescription, but couldn’t afford to have it filled. Tragically, she was found dead a week later. She was just 35 years old.  
Our neighbors need and deserve better.  
No matter where they come from or what they look like, I’m called as a minister to serve these people. Together with my congregation and others from the larger community, we do our best to live the scripture by feeding, clothing, and housing our neighbors.  
I call on our elected leaders to uphold these sacred values. In a country and state with so many resources, we should not let our neighbors go hungry, live outside, or suffer without health care. To make sure everyone in our community has what they need, legislators need to look at additional sources of revenue, like raising taxes on the wealthy.  
As they write the next budget, our state legislators should include enough for food banks, emergency and long-term housing, and hospitals and clinics. There are real people in Tukwila and every community in every corner of Washington whose lives literally depend on it.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/food-bank-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-04 17:16:55.564245

Dick Cheney, the Wyoming oilman and politician who was widely considered to be the most powerful vice president in America’s history, died on Monday. He was 84.


Cheney, who grew up largely in Casper, served as Wyoming’s sole U.S. representative in Congress from 1979-1989. It was among his many roles in Washington. At age 34, he became the youngest presidential chief of staff in history when President Gerald Ford appointed him to the post. He served as secretary of defense under George H.W. Bush, and years later joined the ticket of George W. Bush to become vice president, serving two terms.
He and his wife of 61 years, Lynne, continued to live part-time in Jackson, and often hosted family there. Later in his life, Cheney became a close political advisor to his eldest daughter, Liz Cheney, who followed in his footsteps with a career in politics — and one that also grew polarizing.

Cheney was famously in D.C. as terrorists attacked America on Sept. 11, 2001, the defining event of his career. With President Bush in Florida that day, Cheney presided over the chaotic and terrifying early hours of the attack from the Presidential Emergency Operations Center located underneath the White House — authorizing military force against civilian airplanes. He later became the chief architect of the war on terror.
While Cheney had admirers who respected his clear-eyed decisiveness, formidable intelligence and enduring patriotism, he also had detractors. The latter camp decried the surveillance and interrogation tactics implemented under his leadership as blatant civil liberties violations, and portrayed him as a Darth-Vaderesque figure — a sinister, secretive force orchestrating behind the scenes of the Bush administration.
In a nod to that, Cheney once showed up dressed as the “Star Wars” villain for a “Tonight Show” interview with Jay Leno. That, friends say, is an example of his sense of humor and proof that he was far more complicated than he was portrayed to be.
“He was fun and he could be funny, but he was also very serious,” said Judy Legerski of Lander, who has known Cheney since she worked on his first congressional campaign. “He was just a good, solid person. And a real guy.”
Friends remember Cheney as a cool-headed man of steely loyalty and deep consideration for others. He was a devoted husband and father, an avid fisherman and an accomplished outdoorsman. (He did find himself the subject of jokes after accidentally shooting an acquaintance during a 2006 hunting trip.) He wasn’t one for small talk, but if engaged on the right topic, he would expound at length.
“Dick’s one of the smartest people I’ve ever known in my life,” Legerski said. “His abilities of analysis were remarkable. You could ask a question, and he’d answer it like he’d done a research study on the topic two days before.”

Cheney was even-keeled and straightforward, a scholar of American history who loved dogs and was never one for the drama.  

“He looked you right in the face if you had something to say,” remembers John McConnell, who was Cheney’s speechwriter in the White House. “He kind of had a way of tilting his head and listening to you, and he just was always great to work with. He was the most considerate and appreciative person I’ve ever worked for.”
He was hard-working and deeply committed to serving the country, said Steve Hadley, who served with Cheney at the Pentagon then in the White House as national security adviser.
“I would hope that (Americans) would recognize him as a man of integrity and talent, who loved the country, who put service to the country as his top priority, and was a terrific vice president in being supportive of the president and doing what the president needed him to do in order to keep this country safe,” Hadley said.
Cheney is survived by his wife, Lynne, daughters Liz and Mary, and several grandchildren. He died due to complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, according to a statement from his family.
  Early life 

Richard Bruce Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska on Jan. 30, 1941 to a family of New Deal Democrats. His father was quiet, his mother high-spirited and convivial. His family moved to Casper when he was 13 after the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Soil Conservation Service reassigned his father to a new post.
As an adolescent, he played sports, explored the high plains with his brother, Bob, and developed a fishing addiction. Though a voracious reader of history, he was never a great student. In high school, he met and fell in love with Lynne Vincent, a bright and pretty student who was the state champion baton twirler. During their senior year at Natrona County High School, he was class president and she was homecoming queen. (The school’s football field now bears his name.)
Though a bit aimless, Cheney was advised by Casper oilman Tom Stroock to apply to Yale. Stroock assured Cheney the elite East Coast university was interested in geographic diversity. Cheney was accepted and awarded a full scholarship.
But after arriving in New Haven, Cheney fell in with a group of boys more interested in a good time than good grades, according to his memoir, “In My Time.” After two false starts, Cheney failed out.
He returned to Wyoming to “work in the tools” as a union member on jobs like installing electrical transmission lines. The work, which was physical and could be dangerous, paid well, but Cheney fell deeper into drinking with his work buddies. He was arrested twice for driving under the influence. The second arrest became a crucial fulcrum point in his life.
“Lynne, after spending a semester in Europe, had graduated summa cum laude from Colorado College,” Cheney recalled in his memoir. “And I was sleeping off a hangover in the Rock Springs jail.”
Determined to turn his life around, he stopped frequenting bars and enrolled at the University of Wyoming. In 1964, Lynne accepted his marriage proposal. They were married in August that year, and Cheney turned his focus to a career and fatherhood.
  Politics 

Cheney studied political science at UW, and got his first taste of political machinations as an intern in the Wyoming Legislature. Though he and Lynne had both planned to become college professors, his interests led him instead into politics. His first job came during the Nixon administration in 1969, when then-Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity Donald Rumsfeld hired Cheney as a congressional relations aide. That was the beginning of a decades-long mentorship and working relationship with Rumsfeld.
When Rumsfeld became President Gerald Ford’s chief of staff in 1974, Cheney acted as his deputy. And when Rumsfeld was bumped to secretary of defense in 1975, Cheney was promoted to fill the chief of staff vacancy.
After Ford lost his re-election bid to Jimmy Carter in 1976, Cheney decided to run for office himself. Not long after he moved Lynne and their two daughters back to Casper, he set his sights on the state’s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. That’s when Legerski met him.
“Dick and two others were running on the Republican primary, and at the time, I was, for whatever reason, a hot political commodity around here,” Legerski said. “So each of these three people came and talked to me, and after talking to them, I determined that Dick was the guy I would support.”
She was impressed with his intellect and demeanor, she said.
That first primary, when Cheney vied against Ed Witzenburger and Jack Gage for the GOP nomination, was the toughest of his six campaigns for House, Cheney recalled in his memoir. After many previous years in D.C., one of his major tasks was convincing residents that he was in touch with them. He embarked on a dizzying tour of Wyoming diners, radio stations and town halls.

He was campaigning in Cheyenne in June 1978 when he awoke in the middle of the night with tingling in his left hand. Cheney, 37 at the time, was having a heart attack. 

He was treated and released with instructions to rest. He quit smoking and began to eat healthier. Meanwhile, Lynne filled in on his campaign events. After winning the primary, he beat the Democratic challenger.
Cheney was re-elected five times, serving until 1989.
He honed his national security knowledge, assembled a team of Wyoming staffers and worked alongside Republicans such as Newt Gingrich and Phil Gramm. Cheney served as House Minority Whip and chairman of the House Republican Conference.
Among his legislative achievements, he was particularly proud of the 1984 Wyoming Wilderness Act, which added nearly 1 million acres to the state’s wilderness areas. Cheney worked closely with fellow Wyoming congressmen Alan Simpson and Malcolm Wallop to pass the legislation.
The campaign heart attack, however, would be the first of a string of health troubles to plague Cheney. He experienced a second heart attack in 1984, and a third in 1988. He underwent quadruple bypass surgery, suffered a fourth attack in 2000 and received a ventricular assist device implant in 2010. In 2012, at the age of 71, he received a heart transplant, which bought him several more years of life.
  Road to veep 

	  
Cheney left the House in 1989 after President H.W. Bush appointed him secretary of defense. In that post, he oversaw Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm — key phases of the Gulf War. After Bill Clinton’s presidential election, Cheney took the opportunity to do some fishing, plying blue-ribbon waters from British Columbia to Oregon and New Zealand.
Then he went into the private sector, working as chairman and CEO of the energy juggernaut Halliburton, headquartered in Dallas. The proximity allowed him to get to know George W. Bush, who was governor of Texas. Bush’s camp first asked Cheney to run Bush’s presidential campaign, which he declined.
They came back with a new request: Help search for a veep. Cheney agreed. Early efforts, however, were fruitless. Bush eventually persuaded Cheney to accept the post.

Legerski remembers where she was — riding the elevator at Little America in Salt Lake — when Cheney called to give her the news. “And I said, ‘Dick, I remember you telling me you were never hitching your wagon onto someone else’s star.’ And he said, ‘When your president asks, the only answer is yes,’” she said. “And that’s the kind of guy he was.”
The decision vaulted him into the national spotlight, where every aspect of his life was under scrutiny. That included his views on gay rights. Cheney’s daughter, Mary, had come out as gay to the family years before, and he supported her. When asked in a debate about gay marriage, he was careful, answering that while people should be free to enter any relationship they want, gay marriage should be left to individual states, not subject to federal policy.
Famously, the Bush vs. Gore election was controversial, with the U.S. Supreme Court settling the recount dispute in Bush’s favor in December 2000. It was a bumpy start for Cheney, who had suffered another heart attack during the prolonged recount process. It also foretold a difficult era.
Less than a year later, terrorists attacked America on Sept. 11. That morning, a special agent burst through Cheney’s office door, hoisted him by his belt and hustled him down to the emergency operation room, telling Cheney an unidentified aircraft was heading toward the White House.
As with the rest of the country, 9/11 left indelible impacts on Cheney. He became determined to quash terrorists and their supporters with whatever tools of national power were accessible.
“I think that had a searing effect on him,” said Pete Williams, a former NBC news correspondent who worked as Cheney’s press secretary for seven years. “I think he felt that virtually anything that was conceivable to prosecute the war on terror, he was willing to consider.”

In the years that followed, Cheney was criticized for authorizing controversial counterterrorism policies, promoting the inaccurate claim that Iraq was linked to 9/11 and helping to expand executive power. Critics said Cheney committed war crimes, citing the country’s use of domestic spying, torture and indefinite detention. 

“He never flinched when the going got tough, or when the criticism became heated as it did,” McConnell said.
The actions also stem from Cheney’s interpretation of the job, Hadley said. “I think he would say that the first responsibility of the president and vice president was to keep the nation secure, and he took that very seriously.”






Other factors led to Cheney exerting power in ways beyond previous VPs, who had mainly been figureheads. Unlike Bush, Cheney possessed decades of foreign policy, White House and congressional experience. Bush delegated meaningful tasks to him, which meant he served as a kind of chief operating officer for the president, exerting major influence in policy decisions.






As a vice president, Cheney divided the public in unprecedented fashion. People either viewed him with deep admiration, or as a secretive and corrupt man who orchestrated a dark chapter in America’s history — and not much in between.
The latter view was made manifest in “Vice,” a 2018 film starring Christian Bale as Cheney, a cunning and ruthlessly ambitious sociopath.
  Reconciling the man and the reputation 

Those who knew Cheney personally are adamant that the “Vice” character couldn’t be further from the truth.
“The last thing I would describe him as is taciturn or sour,” said Williams. “He was thoughtful, he was serious, he was highly focused. I very quickly realized that Dick Cheney did not do small talk … but I found him to have a great sense of humor, a very self-deprecating sense of humor.”
When it came to the war on terror, Williams said, “I think he felt that was the right thing to do to save the country.”

Legerski can see why Cheney could come off as remote.
“I think in some ways, his gravitas was off-putting to some people,” she said.
But she remembers a warm and considerate family man. The first time Liz Cheney ran for Congress, Legerski remembers, one of the drawbacks was that she wouldn’t be available to chauffeur her daughter to rodeos. 

“So Dick got a truck, and he hauled (his granddaughter) and her horse to all the summer rodeos,” Legerski said. He adorned the pickup’s trailer hitch cover with an image of Darth Vader.
Cheney largely disappeared from the public eye until the aftermath of Jan. 6. Republican support of Cheney and Liz fractured after the younger Cheney became a prominent critic of Donald Trump’s actions related to the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection. Cheney backed his daughter.
He had a refreshing straightforwardness, McConnell said.
“He had high expectations, but he was always fair, easy to deal with in the sense that you knew where you stood with him,” he said. McConnell remembers getting irritated when Cheney would be attacked in the press. Cheney seemed to accept it as part of the gig, and was too busy doing his job to spend much effort refuting the flak. McConnell often wondered if Cheney took the heat so that Bush didn’t have to.
“He wasn’t out there to improve his own image, he was there to serve the president and the country,” he said.
In a 2014 article in Stanford Medicine about Cheney’s long-standing heart issues, Cheney told the publication that before his transplant, he had confronted his mortality.
“I thought about it, I guess, I was at peace,” Cheney said in the article. “I had come to that point where I fully expected that I had lived a wonderful and remarkable life. I had a tremendous family. I had everything a man could ask for.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Liz-Dick-Cheney-full-DeweyV-e1659993900912-1024x742.jpeg,,,2025-11-04 16:57:53.594923

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/04/ned-lamont-ct-snap-benefits/,The Connecticut General Assembly could give the governor a lot of flexibility in deciding when to release funds for SNAP and how much.,"Despite Gov. Ned Lamont’s assurances that Connecticut would safeguard food-insecure residents, it remained unclear Tuesday whether he will replace all vanishing federal nutrition aid as sought by state legislators.
Specifically, Lamont wouldn’t say Tuesday whether he would approve spending the estimated $36 million — less than 1% of Connecticut’s reserves and projected surplus — needed to fund one-half of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for one month.
The governor said Monday he’d agreed with legislative leaders to reserve $500 million in state funds  to temper the pain of stalled federal funding for SNAP and other human service programs. But the bill the General Assembly is expected to adopt later this month in special session reportedly would give the governor a lot of flexibility in deciding when to release funds for SNAP, and how much.
[RELATED: SNAP cuts to families in CT will hit harder than any other state]
President Donald Trump’s administration told a federal judge Monday it would resume paying SNAP benefits at about 50% of normal levels for roughly one month using a special contingency fund.
“We continue to have ongoing conversations with legislative leadership regarding ways to address the cuts and real impact from both the One Big Beautiful Bill and the ongoing government shutdown ahead of the upcoming special session,” Lamont spokesman Rob Blanchard said. “Gov. Lamont is committed to ensuring Connecticut families do not go hungry despite the dysfunction in Washington.”
But legislative leaders from both parties were far more specific Tuesday about what Connecticut must do to protect vulnerable families.
“This is about Connecticut protecting its own,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said.
Ritter met with majority House Democrats in private caucus Monday and said members were pleased that Lamont agreed this week to reserve big state funds to respond to human service programs at risk.
But federal SNAP benefits officially stopped Nov. 1. And since it’s unclear when they might resume, and at what level, many House Democrats want Lamont to spend what’s necessary to restore them to full levels. Legislators also want to preserve benefits for other nutrition programs and for winter heating assistance.
Ritter added Tuesday that this sentiment is bipartisan, and leaders of the House and Senate minorities agreed with him.
“I think, especially going into the holidays, these programs need to be left whole,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford. Although some Republicans might object to state dollars being spent on federal programs, many in the House GOP caucus support stepping up temporarily.
“I would think that the majority of my caucus would support using some state funds, at least temporarily, to provide the full [SNAP] benefits to constituents,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, D-Brookfield.
A full month of SNAP benefits for Connecticut households would cost about $72 million. And half the bill is $36 million, which represents just 2% of the projected state budget surplus and less than 1% of that windfall and Connecticut’s rainy day fund combined.
“This is, in fact, the rainy day that we’ve been saving for for eight years,” Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said, referring to roughly $15 billion in surpluses Connecticut has amassed since aggressive budget caps were installed in 2017. “I believe that we should do everything we can to make sure the full [SNAP] benefits are paid.”
Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, also said she believes majority Democrats want the roughly 360,000 Connecticut residents on SNAP to receive their full monthly benefit. According to state Department of Social Services officials, the average is $324 per household.
“I’m not interested in cutting people off,” Osten said.
Meanwhile, the federal role in the nutrition assistance program remains murky.
A partial federal government shutdown that started Oct. 1 began draining SNAP funds, and President Trump’s administration ended payments on Nov. 1.
Two federal judges ordered the Trump administration Friday to continue SNAP using a special contingency fund, which the White House says would allow benefits to be paid, at roughly half-size, for one month.
And while the president threatened early Tuesday in a social media post to withhold any benefits until the shutdown ends, the White House clarified later in the day that the administration would comply with the courts and issue partial SNAP benefits at some point this month, the New York Times reported.
[RELATED: CT, other states sue Trump administration over SNAP suspension]
Meanwhile, Lamont will face considerable pressure to keep SNAP benefits afloat this winter, or until the shutdown ends. The Democratic governor is expected to announce later this fall that he will seek a third term in 2026. But a significant portion of his base is demanding an aggressive state response to the federal shutdown and its impact on human service programs.
But the governor, a fiscal moderate, has traditionally objected to using state funds to supplement programs normally funded by the federal government.
Lamont faced bipartisan criticism from state legislators in 2023 when they designated $30 million to bolster winter heating assistance programs after Washington had dramatically cut federal resources to pay benefits. The Lamont administration set benefit levels cautiously, and none of the $30 million in state funds were paid out in the winter of 2022-23, even though requests for aid were up 24%.
The governor met late last week with the General Assembly’s Black and Puerto Rican Caucus, which indicated the $3 million in state funds Lamont donated to help food assistance nonprofits in Connecticut — though appreciated — won’t be close to enough to keep vulnerable households from a hunger crisis.
Sen. Gary Winfield, a New Haven Democrat and member of the caucus, noted half of a normal SNAP benefit amounts to about $40 per week.
“If we’re at the point of asking people to feed themselves on $40 … there’s something wrong with us,” he said.
“Any person who thinks that’s a question to be asked,” Winfield added, “should re-think being in a position to make that decision.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024_0207_SR_GovAddress_163-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-04 16:57:53.594923

Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderVoters at a south Atlanta polling place cited local issues like infrastructure and City Council accountability as top concerns Tuesday. Two statewide races for the Georgia Public Service Commission were often an afterthought. 
Yet, voters like the ones streaming in and out of the Thomasville Recreation Center on Tuesday are poised to help Georgia Democrats potentially win their first statewide constitutional office since 2006. 
Two Democrats, Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson, are trying to unseat Republicans Fitz Johnson and Tim Echols from the commission, which regulates the state’s utilities like electricity and natural gas. Democrats have launched a statewide campaign focused on concerns over rising energy prices, citing the current commission’s approval of six power bill increases over the last two years.
Georgia utility races seen as potential bellwether for 2026 midterms

Political observers say Democrats have a chance to win one or both seats on the ballot this year, but more so because of the concurrent municipal elections that could boost turnout among left-leaning voters than any angst over power bills.
For many voting in Atlanta, where local races are abundant, the election was a referendum on the immediate quality of life in their neighborhoods. Brad DiFiore, a 56-year-old consultant in Atlanta, said he was primarily disappointed by the lack of progress on the city’s transportation and infrastructure projects. He said he was aware of the PSC race, but it was not the main draw for him.
“I wouldn’t say I was paying that close of attention to it, but I know the consequences,” DiFiore said. “So, I voted for Democrats across the board on it.”
Aside from making sure their voices were heard on local issues, many Atlanta voters simply wanted to exercise their right to cast a ballot. Titus Rousseau, a 46-year-old custodian in Atlanta, said that as a Black man, he makes sure his vote is cast in every election.
“Being a Black man, especially in this community right here, I’m coming to vote. As long as I can breathe and wake up, I’m coming to go vote,” Rousseau said.
Aireon Himes, a 45-year-old construction worker in Atlanta, said the statewide races were “not particularly” a focus of his, but that he wanted to exercise his right to vote and “get as many of my side in office as possible.”
“I just kind of voted blue down the line pretty much,” Himes said.
Austyn Young, a 35-year-old business analyst, said she was aware that the average Georgia Power bill in Georgia had increased, but she was primarily voting based on local concerns about “protection for our tree canopy” and wanted to support candidates who support preserving Atlanta’s urban forest. Even with the focus on local issues, she said she “definitely paid special attention” to the PSC election, “especially given the power bills that have been on the rise,” she said.
She said she feels that Democrats, who campaigned on energy affordability, were successful in reaching voters in her community.
“One thing I didn’t realize was that the (current) board is all Republican, and so I think it’s important for both sides to be represented,” Young said. “Hearing about it and hearing that messaging is important, and raising awareness to get the proper representation was really important.”

Speaking after casting his vote in Brighton, Galvin said both cities were under close supervision by his office as municipal elections unfold in 55 cities and towns across Massachusetts.
Galvin said early indications show the Boston Election Department “on a good path” following a year of reforms prompted by serious ballot distribution failures during the 2024 general election. 
“We’ve had a lot of activity over the past year. We’ve improved practices,” he said. “Mr. [Michael] Sullivan, the receiver, is very satisfied.”
Boston’s elections have been under state receivership since February, when Galvin ordered outside oversight after some polling places ran out of ballots last November. His office required the city to overhaul communication systems, retrain poll workers and adopt new procedures for monitoring ballot supply and machine issues in real time.
“The lesson learned is when you have good practices, you have good results,” Galvin said, adding that the city’s polling locations were operating smoothly and that no major issues had been reported. 
He said his office would evaluate whether to end the receivership after the election, and that his office has “other places to deal with as well.”
In Lawrence, state observers and State Police have been stationed at polling sites following reports that campaign workers had submitted incomplete or falsified absentee ballot applications. Galvin said the state’s involvement was prompted by “processes that raised red flags” rather than by concerns about early or mail voting itself.
“We did have applications filed by campaigns and they were not completed entirely by the voters,” Galvin said. “There wasn’t sufficient information from the voters to identify who they were and to make sure they really wanted an early or absentee ballot.” 
A University of Massachusetts/WCVB poll released Monday found 61 percent of respondents support requiring all voters to show government-issued photo identification to vote, with 21 percent against it.
He said that after warnings and an information session with candidates failed to correct the practices, his office dispatched state troopers and election officials from other communities to oversee the process for every day of early voting from Oct. 25 through Oct. 31, and on Election Day.
Galvin said his office rejected incomplete, altered or incorrectly filled out ballot applications submitted by campaigns and increased its physical presence in the city to support local election workers. A campaign can submit absentee ballot applications that they have collected from voters, his spokesperson said, but in Lawrence “it became clear that some voters were either unaware that they had applied for an absentee ballot or did not qualify to vote absentee.”
“Any voter whose application was rejected was notified of the rejection and the reason for rejection, and encouraged to contact the Lawrence Elections Division to discuss their voting options. All of this has taken place over the last few weeks. The official written Order from the Secretary was sent on October 16, with an additional Order on October 27,” spokesperson Deb O’Malley said.
“We needed to make sure we were physically present there to provide support for the local election officials,” Galvin said. “The State Police were present and observing conduct because we saw continuing conduct from campaigns that we felt was not in the best interest of the voters.”
He said any decision about criminal charges would rest with the attorney general or district attorney.
“Obviously, we’re observing everything we see,” Galvin said. “If there’s conduct to be investigated, that’ll be up to the attorney general and the district attorney, who have both been participants in our efforts up to now.”
In Boston, Galvin said state election staff are stationed inside City Hall on Tuesday but not at individual precincts because “there’s no need of it.” He said communication systems and ballot management procedures had improved significantly since last year’s failures. 

Secretary of State William Galvin walks out from casting his vote on Election Day at his polling location in Brighton on Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025.
“We’re very comfortable,” Galvin said.
Asked about outside interference, Galvin said his office had seen no indication of it. 
“No, no, we feel pretty good,” he said. “My office is in regular contact with [poll workers]. We have people on the ground here… The goal here, again, is elections are about voters. It’s not about campaigns. It’s not about candidates.”
Galvin projected that voter turnout would vary widely across the state, noting that many communities had uncontested races. 
“Many communities don’t have a lot of contests, Boston being one of them,” he said. “That’s why the turnout in Boston will be relatively low for a mayoral election year.”
Voting reform bills enabling people to register and cast ballots during early voting or on Election Day has failed to advance again this year, despite significant support for the idea among some lawmakers and in polling.
The deadline to register to vote is 10 days before any election.
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu is running unopposed after her primary opponent, Josh Kraft, dropped out after Wu outpolled him 72 percent to 23 percent in the primary. 
Galvin, a Boston resident, said his own ballot was rejected from the machine a few times because there were so few dark circles on it, as there are not many races in the city this year.
He said turnout would likely be stronger in cities with competitive races, such as Everett, Fall River, Lawrence, Taunton and Worcester. 
“All of those communities, I think, will have a fairly decent turnout,” he said, pointing to already strong participation in vote-by-mail and early voting.
Galvin said early voting continues to be popular and effective. 
“We’re seeing very high participation at these levels, and it’s very helpful to voters to have multiple options to vote so they’re not restricted just for the hours on election day,” he said. “It shows that voters are serious about these things.”
Galvin, now in his eighth term as secretary, said the day’s goals are straightforward: “The objective today is for the voters to make a choice” he said. “Whatever choice they make is their choice. It shouldn’t be anybody else’s, but theirs.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/BillGalvin.webp?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-04 16:57:53.594923

(Photo by McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Democratic attorneys general have notched another victory after a federal judge in Rhode Island Tuesday ruled the Trump administration can’t tie billions of dollars meant for road and bridge repairs to states’ cooperation with civil immigration enforcement.
The administration “blatantly overstepped” its statutory authority in trying to place immigration-related conditions on federal funding U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. ruled in his permanent injunction against the U.S. Department of Transportation.
“The Constitution demands the court set aside this lawless behavior,” McConnell wrote.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha celebrated McConnell’s ruling.
“It should go without saying that the ability of Rhode Islanders to travel on safe roads and bridges cannot hang on the political whims of one man,” Neronha said in a statement.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to request for comment. 
Twenty states, led by California, filed suit in Providence in May after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy issued a directive outlining the administration’s expectations for cooperation in return for infrastructure grants that had already been approved by Congress.
20 state AGs sue feds for tying transportation and disaster funding to immigration enforcement

“Federal grants come with a clear obligation to adhere to federal laws,” Duffy said in a statement when the directive was issued in April. “It shouldn’t be controversial — enforce our immigration rules, end anti-American DEI policies, and protect free speech.”
Joining Rhode Island and California in the lawsuit were AGs from Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai’i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, and Vermont.
The states argued that such a directive was outside the scope of the agency’s power and was “impermissibly vague.” 
DOT attorneys have argued in court that the statute governing the agency, as enacted by Congress, allows it to impose any conditions on grant agreements so long as it “reasonably determines” those conditions align with its core mission.
But McConnell found that the conditions were too unrelated to transportation issues for the DOT to try to impose such funding conditions.
“Had Congress wished to try to make federal transportation funding contingent on cooperation with federal civil immigration enforcement, it could certainly have attempted to do so,” McConnell, an Obama appointee, wrote.
He added that the Trump administration had failed to explain why the court should stay any ordered relief, noting that the DOT never even appealed the preliminary injunction that was issued in June.
“The court sees no reason it should stay relief now that the case has reached summary judgment,” McConnell wrote.
McConnell’s ruling Tuesday served another blow to the Trump administration. On Oct. 31, he ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to tap into contingency funds to cover food stamp funding amid the ongoing federal government shutdown.
The USDA promised Monday it would provide partial payments to households who use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). But on Tuesday morning, President Donald Trump suggested on social media that funding would resume only after the government reopens.
Plaintiffs in the case of Rhode Island State Council of Churches v. Brooke Rollins have since asked McConnell to issue a temporary restraining order to ensure the USDA follows through on its pledge made Monday. A hearing will be held over Zoom at 3:30 p.m. Thursday.

An outage made it seem as if voter information had disappeared.
Kathleen Roblez, a lawyer with Forward Justice who worked on a statewide voter hotline Saturday, said calls came in from voters and volunteers who couldn’t find their names on the site. 
“It caused a lot of people to be panicked that they had gotten kicked off the rolls somehow,” she said.
Colin Loftin, North Carolina Board of Elections database manager, said in an email to NC Newsline that the outage did not affect voting, and no one was turned away from polling places. 
Loftin said the problem was caused by a database replication error. He said the outage lasted about 8 hours, and the portal was working normally again by about 8:30 p.m.  

Early voting ended at 3:00 p.m. Saturday in municipalities that offered it. 
Municipal elections are being held in 88 counties to elect city council members, mayors and other local officials. Some of the state’s biggest cities, including Charlotte, Greensboro, Durham, and Wilmington are electing mayors, and Charlotte has a transportation sales tax question on the ballot. 
Some voters on Saturday were trying to check the voter database to make sure they were registered at the correct address, Roblez said. They wanted to know if they needed to bring extra documents in case they needed to record an address change, she said.
Others called the hotline because they wanted someone to know there was a problem.
There was no official notice of the outage until early voting ended. 
A notice posted to social media and on the lookup site would be helpful if another outage were to happen “so people would know as soon as possible,” Roblez said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Voting-booths-Getty.jpg,,,2025-11-04 16:57:53.594923

The hearing before the House Oversight Child Welfare System Subcommittee also included testimony from a woman hailed by conservative activists as a whistleblower against a health care system that engaged in gender affirming care, who claimed that children and teenagers facing uncertainty over their sexual orientation should ride out their adolescence into adulthood before making a decision to transition to another gender that more closely matches how they feel.
Chaired by Republican state Rep. Luke Meerman of Coopersville, the subcommittee hearing offered no counterbalance to the claims of supposed harm that affected the lives of those testifying. No advocates for, or members of, the transgender community, their families nor gender affirming care providers attended the hearing.

House communications staff said that state Rep. Sharon McDonnell (D-Troy) invited Equality Michigan to speak during the hearing, but the organization backed out at the last minute. In future hearings, the Republican-controlled committee is planning to invite transgender community activists, hospital representatives and the American Medical Association to give testimony.
That said, Emme Zanotti, the senior director of Movement Building and Political Affairs with Equality Michigan said the opposite was true, and that the organization reached out and inquired about testifying, not the other way around.
Those who testified warned of what they described as lasting harm from making the decision to transition too early, and of a medical system that they felt pushed them into beginning gender affirming treatments without care for their mental health and well being.
McDonnell was the sole voice in defense of the transgender community among the five-person subcommittee to say that many people who undergo surgeries or therapies in gender affirming medical care have positive experiences and go on to live happy lives, and that the population that regrets those decision years later or have complications is 1% to 2%.
Still, McDonnell acknowledged the experiences shared during the hearing as legitimately painful even if they did not represent the sum total experience of transgender people.

All of this occurred against the backdrop of bills introduced in May by state Rep. Brad Paquette (R-Niles), Rep. Tom Kunse (R-Clare) and Rep. Jaime Greene (R-Richmond), which seek to prohibit gender affirming medical care for Michigan youth and teenagers. The legislative package includes House Bill 4466, House Bill 4467 and House Bill 4468.
The lead bill, HB 4467, creates statutory definitions of what it means to be a man or a woman and offers no legal definitions nor acknowledgements of other identities on the gender spectrum, a position at odds with scientific consensus.
The bill does not define gender, either, defaulting only to a classification of biological sex, which Paquette describes as “an individual’s immutable biological classification as male and female.”
The meat of the policy states that, as otherwise provided in law, a health care professional shall not knowingly engage in or cause any gender affirming care practices to be administered on a minor child or teenager. That includes hormone therapies to increase or block androgen, testosterone, estrogen or progesterone, or surgeries to alter a person’s genitalia.
Paquette’s legislation would create a legal cause of action that a person could file against a health care provider or health system. It would also give the attorney general’s office the ability to pursue legal remedies.
The other two bills, sponsored by Greene and Kunse, respectively, would allow insurance companies to cover procedures or medications to undo gender affirming care, and create licensure sanctions for medical providers.
Each of the bills were referred to the House Health Policy Committee. They have not yet received a hearing, but the testimony taken Tuesday before the House Oversight subcommittee will undoubtedly play a role in future discussions on the bills, and could recycle some of the same testimony in the larger committee.
None of the legislation has any chance of actually becoming law while Democrats control the state Senate, and Gretchen Whitmer, a staunch LGBTQ+ advocate, remains as Michigan’s governor.
Following the hearing, Zanotti said Equality Michigan’s Action Network welcomes constructive, substantive and educational dialog with all Michiganders, whether that be legislators or otherwise, on the role and nature of gender affirming care.
Zanotti, however, said that conversation needs to take place in “an arena where transparency and the truth are promoted, and that’s not what happened today.”
“The House Oversight Committee, and now one of its subcommittees, under Republican leadership have spent four and a half hours in eight days trying to delegitimize trans people’s existence and erase them from the state of Michigan,” Zanotti said.

As to whether the bills also served as a way to erase or delegitimize the transgender experience in Michigan, Zanotti said the response was the same.
“What was all of this for today?” Zanotti said. “If we’re concerned about the well being of gay kids or trans kids, and one of the speakers seemed very concerned about the well being of gay kids – we have that in common at Equality Michigan Action Network – why wasn’t today’s conversation about food assistance for people who are being impacted by Trump’s government shutdown? Where was that conversation? That’s what’s hurting kids in Michigan, LGBTQ or otherwise.”
Zanotti went on to say that gender affirming care remains legal in Michigan, as well as safe, despite the current presidential administration’s attempts to actively make the practice less safe for young people and their families.
“Providers are following the law. They’re following evidence-based standards when they provide this care, and most importantly, young people and their families need to continue to be able to be the ones who are making this decision about their futures,” Zanotti said. “That shouldn’t be up to elected officials in Lansing or Washington, D.C.; it shouldn’t be up to people who have made false whistleblowing claims that have not borne true in investigations. It should be up to parents and their kids, full stop.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1471006528-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-04 16:57:53.594923

At the end […]","Third District Judge Dianna Gibson listens during a hearing in Utah’s court-ordered redistricting process, in Salt Lake City on Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025. (Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune) Attorneys for the Utah Legislature and the plaintiffs in the state’s redistricting legal battle cast their final arguments on Tuesday in front of 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson, who must now sort through more than 1,000 pages of evidence and 15 hours of testimony before deciding the future of Utah’s congressional boundaries.
At the end of the hearing, Gibson said she would issue a decision “on or before” Nov. 10. That’s the deadline state election officials have said is the latest possible date a new congressional map can be chosen in order to give county clerks time to prepare for the 2026 elections. 
Until then, the question remains: Will the judge allow the Republican-controlled Legislature’s preferred map to stand? Or will she agree with the plaintiffs and pick one of their two alternatives instead?
Meanwhile, another issue consumed most of Tuesday’s hearing, which focused on debate over whether Gibson should block SB1011, a law that the Utah Legislature approved last month along with their preferred map (known as map C), requiring that three specific statistical tests be used to evaluate congressional maps: the partisan bias test, the mean-median difference test, and an ensemble analysis. 
The plaintiffs suing the state — which include the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government, the Campaign Legal Center and a handful of Salt Lake County voters — have alleged that the law “cherry picks” statistical tests that are flawed to guard against partisan favoritism in a state like Utah, where the majority party (Republicans) consistently win by wide margins in statewide elections.

They claim SB1011 gives lawmakers “cover” to pass a map that doesn’t comply with Proposition 4 – a law passed by voters in 2018 requiring an independent redistricting process that adheres to a prioritized list of neutral map-drawing criteria, starting with minimizing city and county splits. 
By requiring the use of three statistical tools that their redistricting experts testified are problematic in a state like Utah, the plaintiffs assert that the Legislature again passed a law that “impaired” Proposition 4 and therefore violates their right to alter and reform their government through a ballot initiative. 
“The court has a ton of evidence before it to conclude these changes in SB1011 impair Prop 4,” one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys, Aseem Mulji, said in front of Gibson on Tuesday. 
The partisan bias test, especially, creates a “filter” preventing a map that allows a congressional district that leans Democratic. 
“If it has a Democratic district, it’s going to be culled, it’s going to be rejected,” Mulji said. 
But the Legislature’s attorney, Tyler Green, argued the Legislature passed SB1011 in response to their interpretation of a line in Gibson’s previous Aug. 25 ruling when she voided the state’s 2021 congressional map. 
In that ruling, Gibson wrote that “given the general, non-specific nature” of Proposition 4’s language, the Legislature “retains discretion in determining what judicial standards are applicable and they retain discretion to determine the ‘best available data and scientific and statistical methods’ to use in evaluating” maps.
Green argued that because Proposition 4 specifically calls out “measures of partisan symmetry” to be included in the “best available” methods, lawmakers codified the partisan bias test as a required tool. 
Redistricting plaintiffs: Judge has ‘no choice’ but to void Utah Legislature’s map, pick another

“The Legislature had to find a test to measure partisan symmetry. There was no getting around it,” Green said, pointing to testimony from the Legislature’s retained redistricting expert — Sean Trende, senior elections analyst for Real Clear Politics — who said the partisan bias test is the best and only method. 
He also argued that expert testimony from both sides showed that “none of these tests are perfect,” but the Legislature was put in an “unprecedented” position to figure out how to comply with Proposition 4’s requirements, so it used its discretion to set some guardrails on how to test for partisan favoritism. 
During Green’s arguments, Gibson asked multiple questions, including whether lawmakers believed that they “had to codify a specific test” in order to comply with Proposition 4. 
Green said lawmakers’ concern was “if we do nothing … then it’s impossible for us to know what target we’re shooting at.”
“It’s impossible for us to say for the public, ‘Look, these were the objective measures we were using,’” Green said, adding that it was also meant to ensure “the court knows this is the Legislature’s view on what was the best available” methods and why legislators chose their preferred map. 
But Gibson pointed to the plaintiffs’ experts testimony that “seem to suggest that by applying these metrics, the ones that have been codified under SB1011, that you significantly limit all of the available options for a proposed (map), and those limits all favor the majority party.” 
“So maybe help explain how limiting and restricting the qualitative and quantitative metrics helps to facilitate Prop 4 and the ultimate goal of anti gerrymandering?” Gibson asked. 
Another redistricting twist: Utah GOP changes tactics to repeal independent map-drawing law

Green said arguments that the partisan bias test is “no good” assumes that the only maps “that are fair are the ones that guarantee a seat for Democrats in the first place.” 
Green said one of the plaintiffs’ experts, Jowei Chen, used an algorithm that almost always created a district concentrated in northern Salt Lake County, and he argued the court has “plenty of evidence to suggest that Dr. Chen’s simulations were anything but neutral.” 
But Gibson said that “one of the things that was most interesting to me” was that one of the Legislature’s experts, Michael Barber, political science professor at Brigham Young University, used simulations that treated Salt Lake County differently than other counties, allowing that county to be “cut up more than once.” 
“So maybe explain the validity and credibility of running those simulations in that way,” she asked Green. 
Green responded that there’s “no dispute” that Salt Lake County’s population is big enough that it must be split at least once in order to draw a congressional map in Utah with equal populations in all four districts. 
“The whole of Salt Lake County cannot be kept intact. It must be split,” Green said, adding that while Proposition 4 requires minimizing county splits, it doesn’t specify how many splits are acceptable. 
When questioning the plaintiffs’ attorney, Mulji, Gibson asked about the Legislature’s stance that they were required to codify the use of the partisan bias test because their experts said it was the best way to measure for partisan symmetry. 
“The fact that it’s called out (in Proposition 4), does it give more importance?” the judge asked. 
Mulji argued there was no one “exclusive way” to measure partisan symmetry and assess for partisan favoritism, “but the statute makes clear partisan symmetry is just one of multiple methods.”

,DC,2025-11-04 21:40:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Former VP Dick Cheney, champion of aggressive foreign policy, dies at 84",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/former-vp-dick-cheney-champion-aggressive-foreign-policy-dies-84,,"Former Vice President Dick Cheney, an architect and chief practitioner of neoconservative foreign policy who was an influential figure among a generation of Republicans, died Monday.Cheney died at 84 of complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, according to a statement from his family published by several news outlets.Cheney’s decades in Washington included stints as White House chief of staff to President Gerald Ford; as Wyoming’s U.S. House member from 1979 to 1989; and as secretary of Defense under President George H.W. Bush. Cheney then served as vice president under Bush’s son, George W. Bush, from 2001 to 2009.Cheney was best known for pursuing an aggressive foreign policy to protect American interests, including as a leading advocate for the invasion of Iraq in 2003.That war, in which nearly 5,000 U.S. servicemembers and untold Iraqis died over eight years, without showing that the ruling Saddam Hussein regime possessed weapons of mass destruction or had any ties to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, turned public opinion against neoconservatives.Cheney kept a relatively low profile after leaving office, other than to endorse his daughter Liz Cheney for the U.S. House seat he once held. He underwent a heart transplant in 2012 after a fifth heart attack.Cheney rift with TrumpPresident Donald Trump, in his first campaign for the White House, criticized the Iraq War and the George W. Bush administration, creating a rift within the GOP in which Trump ultimately prevailed.Trump’s feud with the Cheneys later intensified while Liz Cheney held the U.S. House seat from Wyoming. After voting for Trump twice, Liz Cheney consistently strongly criticized Trump’s involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and later served as vice chair of the House committee investigating that matter.The younger Cheney’s involvement with that probe resulted in her ouster from House Republican leadership and, eventually, her House seat itself.In 2022, Dick Cheney, who had mostly retired from public life, appeared in an ad for his daughter’s reelection campaign. Wearing a large cowboy hat and speaking directly to camera, he called Trump a coward who “tried to steal the last election, using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters have rejected him.”“He lost his election, and he lost big,” Cheney said. “I know it. He knows it. Deep down, I think most Republicans know it.”In the 2024 election, both Liz and Dick Cheney endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris against Trump.Trump did not release an official statement on Cheney’s death Tuesday. At a White House press briefing Tuesday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was “aware” of Cheney’s passing and White House flags had been lowered to half-staff, in accordance with law. She did not answer questions about Trump’s involvement in funeral arrangements or if he’d spoken to Cheney family members.Praise for Cheney's patriotismMost other high-ranking officials across party lines in the nation’s capital sent well-wishes to the Cheney family and recognized the former vice president as an influential figure.“Dick was a calm and steady presence in the White House amid great national challenges,” George W. Bush wrote in a statement. “I counted on him for his honest, forthright counsel, and he never failed to give his best. He held to his convictions and prioritized the freedom and security of the American people. For those two terms in office, and throughout his remarkable career, Dick Cheney’s service always reflected credit on the country he loved.”President Joe Biden praised Cheney’s devotion to public service and his family.“Guided by a strong set of conservative values, Dick Cheney devoted his life to public service,” he wrote on X. “While we didn’t agree on much, he believed, as I do, that family is the beginning, middle, and end.”Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also praised Cheney’s willingness to oppose Trump.“Dick Cheney was a patriotic American who loved his country,” she wrote. “While we strongly disagreed on most policy issues, his patriotism was clear when he returned to the House Floor to commemorate the first anniversary of January 6th. We all saw then how proud Vice President Cheney was to see his daughter, Liz, follow in her father’s footsteps to serve in the House with courage and integrity.”U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune commended Cheney in a Tuesday floor speech, saying he “played a key role in shaping policy in many of the most consequential issues of his day.” “Dick Cheney was a lifelong public servant who believed very deeply in our country and brought his considerable knowledge and intelligence to its service,” Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, paid tribute to Cheney’s public service at the start of his daily press conference.“Scripture is very clear: We give honor where honor is due,” Johnson said. “As you know, Dick Cheney served as vice president, he served as a secretary of defense. He served as a congressman, of course, in Wyoming, and as the youngest chief of staff to any president in the history of the country. And so the honor is certainly due to him.”Sen. John Barrasso, a Republican who is the longest-serving member of Wyoming’s congressional delegation, said in a social media post the state “mourns the passing of Vice President Dick Cheney.”“Dick’s career has few peers in American life,” Barrasso wrote. “His unflinching leadership shaped many of the biggest moments in domestic and U.S. foreign policy for decades. Dick will be remembered as a towering figure who helped guide the course of history in Wyoming, the United States, and around the world.”Shauneen Miranda contributed to this report.",,,,2025-11-04 16:57:53.594923

Larry Rhoden has appointed Seventh Circuit Presiding Judge Robert Gusinsky to serve as a supreme court justice for the First Supreme District, the governor’s office announced Tuesday.
The vacancy was created by the retirement of Justice Janine Kern. The First Supreme District consists of the counties of Custer, Lawrence, Meade and Pennington.
“Justice Kern has done a remarkable job serving our state with integrity and fairness,” Rhoden said in a news release, “and I have no doubt that Judge Gusinsky will pick up the torch with the same commitment and conviction.”
Gusinsky was born in Latvia. After emigrating with his parents through Israel and Germany, he settled in California and became a U.S. citizen.
Gusinsky enjoyed his earlier career as an airline pilot before changing course to pursue law. He enrolled at the University of South Dakota Knudson School of Law in 1993. Following graduation, he practiced as a trial lawyer at Lynn, Jackson, Shultz & Lebrun and later at Clayborne, Loos, Strommen & Gusinsky in Rapid City.
Gusinsky went on to serve in the U.S. Attorney’s Office before being appointed to the Seventh Circuit bench by former Gov. Dennis Daugaard. In 2024, the chief justice named Gusinsky the presiding judge of the Seventh Circuit.

(Photo via Google Earth)A federal government oversight agency says the program intended to improve resident care at some of the nation’s worst nursing homes “is not working.”
The Special-Focus Facilities program, which is administered by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, identifies homes with serious, recurring quality-of-care issues and then imposes additional oversight on them in an effort to improve resident care.
That program “is not working,” the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General says in a new report, citing evidence that the homes which successfully graduate from the program exhibit quality-of care deficiencies soon after.
Between 2013 and 2022, the report states, almost two-thirds of the nursing homes that were enrolled in the program improved enough to graduate, “but soon afterward showed the type of quality problems that put them in the SFF program in the first place.”
At any given time, no more than two nursing homes per state appear on CMS’ periodically updated list of Special-Focus Facilities, although the list also includes hundreds of other nursing homes — typically, 10 per state — where ongoing quality-of-care violations have made them eligible for that status.
Once a home is designated a Special-Focus Facility, it receives additional oversight and assistance from the government that’s intended to improve resident care. The other homes that are merely deemed eligible do not receive that assistance. They appear on the list, some for as long as 10 years, and then drop off without ever receiving the federal help.
Conflicting data reported on Iowa nursing homes
CMS data shows several Iowa homes have been enrolled in the program and then closed without graduating. Other Iowa homes have appeared on the list after they have closed.
Among the issues with Iowa nursing homes:
Closed without graduating: The Aspire of Gowrie nursing home had been in the Special-Focus Facilities program for 22 months without graduating before it closed on July 23, 2025.
Added to the list after closing: In 2021, the 125-bed Touchstone Healthcare Community in Sioux City graduated from the program after 44 consecutive months on the SFF list. Less than a year later, however, the home was forced to close in the wake of an emergency court ruling that residents there were at risk.
After the facility closed and residents were moved out, Touchstone was inexplicably added back to CMS’ list of homes eligible for designation as a Special-Focus Facility and then was added to the list of homes that had successfully “graduated” from the program.
Incorrect updates:  In its most recently published SFF list, dated Sept. 24, 2025, CMS states that Greater Southside Health and Rehabilitation Center of Des Moines has been on the eligibility list for 36 months — although that’s also how long CMS claimed the home had been on the list as of July 30, 2025, suggesting CMS is not properly updating its list.
On and off the list: Although CMS currently indicates a Scott County home, The Ivy at Davenport, has been on the eligibility list for only one month, that’s not correct. After 20 months on the list, and amid recurring health care violations, the home was dropped from the eligibility list for one month in June 2025, before being reinstated a few weeks later. That means The Ivy has actually been on the eligibility list for three consecutive months, or 23 of the past 24 months.
CMS has said its goal is to have all SFFs graduate within two years and suggested it might bar Special-Focus Facilities from collecting Medicare or Medicaid dollars for resident care if they fail to improve over time.
According to the inspector general, 495 of the 645 nursing homes designated as Special-Focus Facilities between 2013 and 2022 have successfully graduated from the program. Of the 429 nursing homes that entered and exited the program over a period of 10 years, 96 spent more than two years in the program.
The OIG says that in Iowa, the average time a nursing home spends in the program before graduating is 19 to 23 months.
Currently, there are 15 nursing homes around the nation that have been enrolled in the SFF program for more than two years without graduating. Five of those 15 homes have been in the program for more than three years.
CMS rejects recommendation related to owners
The OIG says one state inspection agency — the name of the state is not disclosed in the report — suggested that after graduating from the program, “nursing home leadership may pull back on improvements they made” while in the program.
“Another state agency observed that some nursing homes prioritize ‘getting off the list’ quickly instead of implementing sustainable improvements,” the OIG report states.
Industry officials have suggested that CMS incorporate more data on staffing levels — some of which is self-reported by care facilities — and lessen its reliance on inspection results to determine which homes need to improve resident care.
As part of its report, the inspector general has suggested that CMS consider enhanced enforcement action against those facilities that graduate from the program and then fall back into noncompliance.
The report also notes that CMS has rejected a recommendation that nursing home ownership information be considered when identifying Special-Focus Facilities and patterns of poor performance.
The inspector general argues that issues linked to common ownership of different facilities could “lead to a deeper understanding of the root causes” of and poor resident care. CMS says its statutory authority does not allow it to take enforcement action against groups of nursing homes due to their common ownership.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins acknowledged Tuesday that he didn’t gather enough support from his Republican caucus to force a special session on Friday as planned.
Hawkins and Senate President Ty Masterson have worked for the past two months to get two-thirds of both chambers to sign a petition for a special session, where they could then redraw congressional maps to try to drive Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids out of office. Masterson previously announced he had the necessary signatures from Senate Republicans.
But a handful of House Republicans refused to join the effort, despite overtures from leadership about other topics that could come up during a special session.
On Tuesday, under the headline “countdown to Jan. 12th,” Hawkins issued a news release that said planning a special session is an “uphill battle” because of challenges with multiple agendas, scheduling conflicts and other factors.
“At the end of the day, a supermajority of Republicans still believe there should be oversight of over a billion dollars in assistance for rural health care, know the difference between a man and a woman, and wish to have a conversation about redistricting,” Hawkins said.
Masterson said in a statement Tuesday the Senate would “continue to deliver” for President Donald Trump, who initiated a multistate fight for a political advantage through gerrymandering.
“President Trump asked Republicans to fight for fair maps and for America’s future,” Masterson said. “We did our part — and we’ll keep leading the charge here in Kansas.”

“If I determine that after the $14 million we need more resources, I will call the Legislature back into session, and I will ensure that West Virginians don’t get hungry — period. Full stop,” Morrisey said. “Don’t let people tell you otherwise.”
A White House spokeswoman said the administration is planning to send partial SNAP benefits for 42 million Americans at some point this month, despite the president’s threat on social media that food assistance “will be given only when those Radical Left Democrats open up the government, which they can easily do, and not before!”
Gov. Wes Moore, Maryland’s Democratic mayor, announced Monday evening that he’d pay $62 million to cover funding for the SNAP food assistance program for this month since the Trump administration plans to only cover about half of the federal program for the month.
Maryland uses a different electronic benefits company than West Virginia. Ahead of the Trump administration’s announcement to pay partial SNAP benefits, Morrisey said the state’s SNAP vendor, Fidelity, couldn’t accept state dollars to fund the program. The governor’s office did not return an answer to a question Tuesday about whether the state could now send money to Fidelity to cover the rest of the SNAP amount for West Virginians.  
Morrisey said he’ll continue to fund food banks as needed. “It doesn’t make sense to say we’re just going to reserve this big pot of money and — maybe we need it, maybe we don’t,” he said, adding he wants the dollars to be used most effectively for those in need. 
It’s unknown at this time when West Virginians using SNAP will see their partial benefit this month. Morrisey said that the state Department of Human Services is working to figure out the reduced benefit amount in accordance with the federal government’s guidelines. 
It may take an estimated four to seven days for the state’s vendor to get the system operational again, Morrisey said. 
“I’m going to press that vendor really, really hard… people can move. They can work through the night. We’re talking about hungry West Virginians,” Morrisey said. 
A spokeswoman for DoHS said they’ll need to work with Optum, an outside vendor that manages the state’s PATH database system. PATH, which has faced a troubled and $308M expensive rollout, provides West Virginia residents the ability to apply for SNAP, Medicaid and other programs.
The state’s contract with Optum includes 30,000 hours designated for modifications and changes including any Federal and State policy change. 
National Guard distributing food statewide as need continues
As of Tuesday morning, 202 state National Guard troops had delivered 6,653 boxes of food to food pantries and supplied another 3,936 boxes directly to residents at pop-up food pantries, Morrisey said. Major General James Seward, the adjutant general for the West Virginia National Guard, said members are planning to distribute more food at pop-up pantries in the state this weekend. 

Residents are encouraged to call 211 if they need help finding food resources.

“As I said last week, the Guard is always ready and always there,” Seward said. “A week ago we started calling our service members to activate some of them to come on to this mission. Not a single employer across West Virginia objected. Every Guard member that we requested was able to leave their normal place of employment and come serve West Virginians. That says a lot about the commitment to West Virginia businesses or on behalf of West Virginia businesses.”
The governor continued to ask for public donations to the Mountaineer Food Bank and Facing Hunger Food Bank to match the state’s contribution.
“The state is stepping up to solve problems that a dysfunctional Washington has led us to, and I think we’re getting some great support across West Virginia, churches, civic groups and businesses are stepping up in a lot of ways,” Morrisey said. 
As of Tuesday, $300,000 had been raised for Mountaineer Food Bank and Facing Hunger Food Bank, he said. Additional in kind donations have come in corporations, he said. 
Caitlin Cook, the director of Advocacy and Public Policy at Mountaineer Food Bank, said she remains in constant contact with the governor’s office and National Guard to make sure the food pantries have what they need to meet the growing need. 
“Our agency relations team is fielding calls from our pantries, working on getting those dollars throughout the communities in West Virginia that need the ability to purchase food,” Cook said. “I know our food pantries, community partners, our member agencies, they are extremely grateful for that cash infusion and that purchasing power.”
“We are cutting checks every single day to our community partners,” she added.
Morrisey said that the food pantries have been asked to spend the money locally to help fill the void that state grocers may be experiencing with an estimated $47 million SNAP benefits delayed in the state.

(Screengrab: NCDPI video stream)  Only a few months ago, the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County school district was asking the state to waive interest on its debt. But on Tuesday, the district announced it has fully repaid the $11.3 million it owed the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, closing a chapter in a financial crisis that left the school system tens of millions of dollars in deficit and under state scrutiny.
The payment, which came sooner than expected, settles the state’s portion of a $46.1 million budget deficit that led to layoffs and a rare intervention from the State Board of Education. 
“On October 28, NCDPI received the full payment of the approximately 3.4 million dollars still owed by WS/FC schools to the State for the school system overdrafts of state money during the 2024-2025 academic year. This is a very positive development,” DPI said in a statement to NC Newsline.
A state audit report released in August found that district leaders used temporary federal COVID-19 funds to cover permanent salaries, approved purchase orders without money in the budget to cover them and delayed routine account reconciliations.
On Tuesday, officials reported that the final $3.4 million payment to the state last month came from a community fundraising effort led by the Winston-Salem Foundation’s Futures Fund. 
“The Futures Fund is collecting donations directly for the purpose of paying out the district’s debt,” said Winston-Salem/Forsyth County School Board Chair Deanna Kaplan. “The fundraising is ongoing, and I just want to thank so much the community and all of the partners for all of their efforts and coming together for our school district.”
State Board of Education Chair Eric Davis praised the effort as evidence of growing public confidence. “The progress made on this and the support demonstrated from the community for our students in Forsyth County is phenomenal, and we congratulate you and every one of those who participated in this groundswell of support.”
District officials told a state board committee that they are now focused on paying the balance still owed to contractors. 
A $4.25 million debt to a custodial company has been restructured and will be paid over 10 years under a new contract approved last month, the committee heard. The district also owes $6.1 million to a staffing firm and roughly $1.6 million to Forsyth County, along with an additional $2 million it borrowed from its own child nutrition fund. 
Officials said the district has already paid down more than $22 million and plans to set aside $3.5 million for debt payments this fiscal year and $4.2 million next year, aiming to finish paying off its short-term debts by 2027.
Under an agreement with Forsyth County, every private dollar raised to reduce the debt results in an equal amount of county debt being forgiven. So far, the matching program has already cleared more than $3.4 million. 
In September, the state board ordered a full review of the district’s finances, and last month it hired Mauldin & Jenkins to audit internal controls. The district is also forming a new citizen audit committee made up of Forsyth County residents with finance expertise to help monitor progress.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Green9032025c.jpg,,,2025-11-04 16:16:46.315732

Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon. (LRC photo)A Kentucky Republican who will soon enter his final legislative session is hoping to strengthen the state’s distracted-driving laws before he leaves office next year. 
Rep. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, presented the “Phone-Down Kentucky Act” to fellow lawmakers Tuesday at the the Interim Joint Committee on Transportation.He was joined by Alyssa Burns, whose daughter Camberleigh died in a 2022 crash after a distracted driver hit their car days before her second birthday.
“Every time I hear (of) a traffic fatality — either a head-on collision, road departure, motorcycle hit by a vehicle, pedestrian hit by a vehicle, or bicyclist hit by a vehicle — I ask myself the question, ‘Could have this been caused by a distracted driver?’” Higdon said. “And I believe a majority of the time, that’s what caused the accident.” 
According to the latest Kentucky traffic collision report from 2023, 814 people were killed in fatal traffic collisions in the state. Driver inattention, distraction and cell phones were contributing factors in more than 20% of those fatal collisions. 
If enacted, the proposal would require drivers to use hands-free technology for cell phones while driving, Higdon said. A copy of the draft bill says drivers cannot hold mobile electronic devices, read or write messages, and watch moving images like videos while driving. The legislation has some exemptions, such as for first responders while performing official duties. 
Higdon told the Kentucky Lantern in September that he was considering filing a bill that would go beyond the state’s current ban on texting while driving, which went into effect in 2011. Higdon has worked on iterations of the legislation in the past, but they haven’t made it through the General Assembly.
A bill Higdon co-sponsored this year would have prohibited drivers from using personal communication devices in ways that require the driver to reach for the device or press more than one button to activate it. The 2026 legislation session will be his final session in the state legislature as he will not seek reelection. His term ends in December 2026. 
Burns, the Louisville woman who testified before lawmakers in support of Higdon’s bill,described the fatal car crash in detail to the committee. A few days before Halloween, she, Camberleigh and Camberleigh’s father were in a car on their way to a family member’s house. Camberleigh fell asleep in her carseat while traffic on the Interstate 71stopped their car. 
“And I turned back around, and black,” Burns said to the committee. “The next thing I remember is someone saying, ‘Your daughter’s gone. I’m sorry.’ And I remember nothing else for the next few days, or even a week. I don’t remember anything else from a brain injury.”
Burns described Camberleigh gruesome injuries to the committee in detail. She added the driver who rear-ended their car was not charged with a crime following the crash. The Louisville Metro Police investigation concluded the driver was “not properly watching the roadway ahead” but the only contributing factor listed was “inattention,” WHAS reported. 
“I know this bill does not bring Camberleigh back, and it doesn’t bring the justice that is due, but it plants a seed for safety and security for our future,” Burns said. 
After the presentation, legislators on the committee were mostly receptive to the idea behind the bill, but some had a few questions. Rep. John Hodgson, R-Fisherville, asked what happens if a driver says they weren’t using their phone but a police officer says they were. Sen. Gex Williams, R-Verona, pointed out that the legislation does allow for “unlocking” a phone, but some devices require a password while others use a thumbprint. Williams added that the section “needs to be tightened up” in his view. 
Higdon, the chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, has power over getting the bill a hearing in his committee, but he will still need to gain support to pass the legislation in the General Assembly. He said that changes can be made throughout the legislative process. 
“This is a winnable battle. With this piece of legislation, we can reduce deaths on Kentucky highways,” Higdon said.

Gretchen Whitmer meeting with foreign leaders during an investment mission to the United Kingdom and Ireland. Photo from Whitmer's office.Following scrutiny from members of the House Oversight Subcommittee on Corporate Subsidies and State Investments and members of the media, a nonprofit providing funding support for Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s overseas trade missions is the subject of a lobbying law complaint.
Bob LaBrant, former general counsel for the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, accused the Michigan Economic Development Foundation of skirting the state’s law requiring lobbyists to register with the state in a complaint filed with the Michigan Secretary of State. 
The foundation holds a partnership with the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, a public-private partnership with the state aimed at attracting business and jobs. As part of its partnership, the foundation “supports efforts that include investment missions, hosting foreign delegations and hospitality opportunities,” as stated on its website.
In his complaint, LaBrant noted that corporations that donate $25,000 or more to the foundation receive membership on its board of directors. 
Whitmer holds an honorary position as the foundation’s ex officio chair, as have previous governors. 
Two members of the foundation also sit on the board of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation according to its 2024 tax filings: Sarah Gonzales of Delta Air Lines and Kelly Hall of CMS Energy, the parent company of Consumers Energy.
The complaint further notes that members of the foundation’s board receive “extraordinary access to meetings with lobby able officials” while some members are invited to travel with the governor and other public officials on trade missions, citing a report from the Detroit News which found that companies with seats on the foundation’s board received about $2.2 billion in economic development incentives from the Whitmer Administration in years past.
LaBrant argued that at events like these, direct communication with officials for the purpose of influencing administrative actions – the definition of lobbying – would be commonplace. 
“If [the foundation] were registered as a lobbyist it would be required to file two reports yearly disclosing food and beverage expenses, travel and lodging, financial transactions with public officials not in the ordinary course [of] business, and gifts spent on public officials,” LaBrant said. “Not being registered as a lobbyist allows [the foundation] to provide public officials with gifts without limit. However, as a lobbyist, [members of the foundation] would be limited to providing gifts to public officials (sporting event tickets, concerts, rounds of golf) not to exceed $79 a month.”
LaBrant argued the foundation, which predates the economic development corporation by 15 years, has evolved into a “state sanctioned slush fund” for insiders at both organizations. He requested the organization register as a lobbying group, and for the group to pay the associated late filing fees. The fine for failing to file a registration statement is $32 a day up to a maximum of $960. 
In an email to the Michigan Advance, Rebecca Bahar-Cook, the foundation’s executive director, said the group does not engage in lobbying.
“Our work is fully within the scope of our charitable mission and complies with all state and federal laws and regulations,” Bahar-Cook said. “[The foundation] is centered on one goal – helping Michigan thrive. We are committed to building a stronger economy and a brighter future for all who live and work here.”

Molly Mandel is on a budget. Like many others her age, the 77-year-old retiree depends on her Social Security check and a small monthly pension to cover her expenses. She only buys food that’s on sale at the grocery store. She thrifts her clothes because the prices at department stores are too high these days. “You go into Penney’s, and you look at a blouse, and it’s 24.99!” she said.
But despite all her penny-pinching, her spending is still more than she sees in her monthly checks. “I’m economizing in as many places as I can, but the inflation of almost everything I use is outpacing my income,” she said.

This report was originally published The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

Now her electricity provider, Arizona Public Service, is proposing to raise her electricity bills for the third time in three years. So when the opportunity came to speak at a town hall on the potential rate hike in Sun City, a retirement community north of Phoenix, she was one of the first to share the way rising costs were already impacting her tight budgeting.
Sitting at a roundtable near the front of the room, she spoke directly to the state attorney general, Kris Mayes, who convened the meeting. “I am a retiree who lives on Social Security and a small pension, and with increases in the Medicare costs that are deducted from Social Security, the food costs, and tariff costs for almost every product brought into the United States, an increase of 16 percent seems outrageous to me,” she said.
She was one of around 40 people who had shown up to the meeting, the first in a series of town halls organized by the attorney general, after the state’s largest electricity providers announced potential rate hikes.

‘The new eggs’
For people across the country, rates are going up at a fast clip, with some experts now calling electricity “the new eggs.”
Over the last year, electricity prices have risen twice as fast as inflation. And residents in 41 states are looking at even higher costs for electricity and natural gas due to proposed rate hikes this year and next, according to an analysis by the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan think tank.
In some states, like Arizona, the increases have been particularly stark. As Mayes noted at the town hall, “The cost of electricity in Arizona has risen faster in the past two years than in the previous nine.” The latest request would raise residential bills by an estimated $240 a year.
For Arizonans, the price increase is on top of the already skyrocketing bills residents are paying in the summertime due to extreme heat, which continues to worsen from climate change.
Utilities have various reasons for raising their rates. In Arizona, for example, an explosion of data centers is leading to a skyrocketing demand for electricity. Extreme weather, like heat and wildfires, is also straining the grid, and the need to upgrade existing infrastructure like transmission lines is raising costs for utilities.
But many utilities are also for-profit entities. Arizona Public Service, one of two utilities asking for rate increases, made a net profit of $608 million in 2024, after raising rates 8 percent last year and the year before.
The CEO of APS, Ted Geiser, has said the rate hikes are necessary to pay for needed upgrades to infrastructure and that the new rate proposal also includes a new way to charge large electricity consumers like data centers to pay for the strain they are putting on the system.
But Mayes, who formerly served on the Arizona Corporation Commission, the body responsible for approving rate hikes, is intervening in this rate case in the hopes of stopping the hike. She thinks it’s obvious that the consecutive hikes are a sign that residents are shouldering some of the cost. “I’ve never seen anything like this in my life,” she told The 19th in an interview. “I’ve been watching utilities for 25 years. I was a utility regulator, and I’ve never seen a situation like this where such incredibly profitable companies are asking residential consumers to subsidize their electricity costs.”
“Enough is enough,” she continued. “Arizonans can’t afford these rate increases anymore and the utility shouldn’t be trying to foist them on people that are already struggling.”
Who is impacted
At 77, Mandel is emblematic of the people who stand to be hit disproportionately by the rising costs: older women.
This demographic is typically living on a fixed income with less in retirement savings and Social Security benefits than men. Women over 65 are also more likely to be living in poverty than men of the same age.
Those realities are translating to worries over how to make ends meet. According to an April poll by the AARP of adults 50 and older, women were more likely to say they were concerned about their electricity bills going up over men, with 50% of women saying they were very concerned compared to 35% of men.
“High energy costs can lead to older adults having to make difficult decisions between paying for heating, cooling, medication, or food,” said Jenn Jones, vice president of financial security and livable communities at AARP, in an email. “The bottom line is stable, affordable energy helps ensure people’s safety, comfort, and health — particularly during extreme weather.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The elderly are also more vulnerable to the effects of climate change. They have a harder time regulating their body temperature, making them more susceptible to heat illness, which is becoming more common due to rising temperatures.
“We’ve had multiple heat-related deaths in Arizona, and one of the reasons I am being so aggressive in these rate cases is because I am very worried that more and more folks are going to feel like they have to turn their AC off so that they can afford their bills,” said Mayes, who is currently investigating the death of an 82-year old woman who died in Sun City in May after her electricity was shut off due to failure to pay her bills.
While there are no nationwide studies on electricity burden that focus on gender and age, in August, the Gender Equity Policy Institute published a California-specific analysis, finding that women are hit hardest by rising energy costs in the state. It also found that senior women — or those 65 and older, were most likely to be energy-burdened — more than senior men and younger adults of any gender. Someone is considered energy burdened if they pay six percent or more of their household income on energy costs. The report also found that in California, the energy burden is worse for Black women and Native women.
The reasons for rising electricity costs vary by state, but some trends in the report can help explain why those costs may be causing older women across the country to feel more anxiety over their utility bills. “A lot of this goes back to the gendered inequalities that women have experienced over their whole life. They on average or more likely to have earned lower wages and accumulated less wealth. And women live longer than men,” said Nancy Cohen, founder and CEO of the institute, and author on the report. “It is understandable and pretty much predictable that senior women would experience this difficulty.”
The report also found that 31% of women-led households were energy burdened compared to 24% of men-led households and that 37% of families headed by single mothers are energy burdened compared to 28% headed by single mothers.
Trump policies
At the same time that rates are going up, policies that could make bills go down are being upended by the Trump administration. Funding to bring more clean energy into the mix, which has consistently gotten cheaper, has been gutted. Energy efficiency standards, which ultimately help consumers save money by incentivizing appliances that use less electricity, have also been rolled back.
And despite Trump’s promises to lower energy bills, his landmark legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is expected to further impact energy prices. According to an analysis by Princeton University, the legislation, which repeals clean energy tax credits and rescinds funding for renewables, is expected to increase electricity costs by $165 a year by 2030, and up to $280 a year by 2035.
And now due to the government shutdown, the Low Income Household Energy Assistance Program, one of the few that helps low-income Americans pay their energy bills, and that prioritizes the elderly, the disabled and those with young children, is in limbo, with funding delayed.
Usually states would have received their allocation by late October or early November – 80% of which is distributed for heating costs. Now, the best estimate by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, an organization that works with state directors of the program, says that funding won’t come until December at the earliest.
According to the organization, the cost of heating a home is expected to increase by 8 percent this year, largely due to the increase in electricity prices, making the dispersal of money even more urgent.
As a result, the organization is asking utilities to voluntarily pause shutoffs for customers who don’t pay their bills. “No family should be forced to choose between heat and food because of a federal funding delay,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, in a news release. “Utilities must act in the public interest and pause shutoffs until federal aid is available again.”
Competing costs
For older people it’s not just electricity that’s rising; health care costs are going up as well.
Margaret Mohr, a 62-year-old who also was in attendance at the Sun City town hall, is facing $800 a month premiums on her health insurance; she is not old enough to qualify for Medicare. She works part time as a licensed counselor, a job she had wanted to transition to long before she retired from law enforcement, but now it’s become the way she can afford her rising costs. “Everything goes up except income,” she said.
Even for those on Medicare like Mandel, costs are also going up. Her premiums are rising by $21 a month, a cost that eats up the recently announced cost of living increase to Social Security. Mandel also worries about the price of medications. She just got a proposal from Cigna, her healthcare provider, which would require her to cover a higher percentage of the cost of certain prescription drugs.
Mandel considers herself lucky. She owns her home and has some resources she can draw from if forced to. But she worries about people she knows who have no financial buffer at all. “It is not just the energy cost, it is the cumulative effect of all those,” she said. “Even if you have additional assets they are depleting those the longer you live.”
She herself worries she might have to relocate. “I might have to downsize, or consider moving outside the country,” she said. “But because I have so much family here I don’t know if I want to make that drastic move.”

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)The financing and federal permitting for SouthCoast Wind remains murky. 
But the path is clear for the Massachusetts offshore wind project to run power lines up the Sakonnet River and across Portsmouth to Mount Hope Bay, with approval from the Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board on Tuesday.
Power purchase agreements between the project developer and Massachusetts and Rhode Island utility suppliers are not yet signed — despite a Nov. 1 deadline — amid continued uncertainty over the staying power of offshore wind under the Trump administration. 
Meanwhile, a federal judge in D.C. granted the administration’s request Tuesday to reconsider a key federal permit which was already approved in the waning days of the Biden administration. The court decision marks a major setback to the already struggling project, allowing the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to start anew on a comprehensive review of potential environmental and economic consequences of the project. 
A spokesperson for SouthCoast Wind did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the court order Tuesday afternoon.
Ronald Gerwatowski, chairman of the Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board, acknowledged the “new level of uncertainty” surrounding SouthCoast Wind. But, that did not deter the three-member panel from concluding its yearslong review for the transmission lines that will connect the project, once built, to the onshore electric grid.
“I am very satisfied with the application,” Gerwatowski said Tuesday. “By the time we reached the evidentiary stage, there was no evidence that would support the denial of this license.”
SouthCoast Wind Energy LLC CEO Michael Brown praised the board’s decision as a key step for the project. 
“This decision underscores Rhode Island’s leadership and regional commitment to providing much-needed domestic energy through responsible development and with good-paying union jobs,” Brown said in a statement Tuesday.

Unlike federal regulators’ overarching review of the 149-turbine project, proposed 60 miles south of Rhode Island, the state energy panel is only considering a 2-mile section of cables snaking through Aquidneck Island. 
SouthCoast Wind Energy, formerly known as Mayflower Wind, filed the application in 2022 to run high-voltage power lines up the Sakonnet River, over the northern tip of Portsmouth and out Mount Hope Bay, connecting to the electric grid in Brayton Point. The review was put on pause in July 2023, after the developer walked away from its initial contract agreements with Massachusetts utility companies in the hopes of securing a better deal. 
Rhode Island’s energy board resumed its consideration in September 2024, after the Spanish developer submitted proof of new, tentative agreements with power supplies in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Negotiations with utility suppliers have dragged on well beyond the initial December 2024 deadline, with companies citing the risks posed by the federal government as reason for delays.
The latest deadline on Nov. 1 came and went without a decision or public acknowledgement. Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, declined to comment on the status of the negotiations in an email Monday. The contracts will determine the project’s financial viability and costs for Rhode Island ratepayers.
The license for the transmission lines is conditioned upon securing other state and federal permits, and financing agreements with utility suppliers. If the developers do not secure these approvals and complete a project within five years — potentially longer if there is justification — the cable license lapses.
“What I didn’t want to happen is that we issued a license that becomes permanent, only to find out the project can’t go forward and then this license sits there which could potentially block use of that route for another offshore wind project,” Gerwatowski explained.
The energy board also asked the developer to consider ways to reduce road closures during construction, though it stopped short of mandating details.
But it rejected a request from the Portsmouth Town Council seeking to limit construction work to 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., or at least limit the decibel level to no more than 70 decibels for properties nearest the underwater drilling. 
Gerwatowski said he did not want to impose restrictions on noise that could limit progress, but asked the developer to consider “reasonable” limits to noise levels.
Portsmouth Town Council President Keith Hamilton maintained that the council’s request was reasonable.
“Our residents have a right to be able to sleep at night and not to be hearing that noise at all hours of the day and night,” Hamilton said in an interview on Tuesday.
Portsmouth is set to receive $23 million in host fees and taxes over the next 33 years in exchange for allowing the developer to build the transmission lines under town roads. The contract was reluctantly approved by the Town Council in January 2024.
Hamilton acknowledged the funds were a “big deal” — a way to pay for town improvements without raising taxes on residents. But he expressed doubt that the project — and the money — would materialize.
“I don’t see this project ever getting off the ground in the next five to 10 years,” Hamilton, a Republican, said.  
A separate permit application related to the SouthCoast cable lines remains under review by the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council.

Gavin Newsom, but his national profile led many to believe that he'd be a favorite to win.","In summary
Sen. Alex Padilla was never officially in the race to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom, but his national profile led many to believe that he’d be a favorite to win.


U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla of California will not run for governor in next year’s highly watched race to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom, the senator unexpectedly announced in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday.
The decision comes after months of speculation that California’s senior senator, who Newsom appointed to succeed former Vice President Kamala Harris after she stepped down in 2020, could throw his hat in the ring and dominate an otherwise open field. 
Padilla’s staff confirmed Tuesday that he would not be seeking the governorship. 
“It is with a full heart and even more commitment than ever that I am choosing to not be running for governor of California next year,” Padilla told reporters in the U.S. Capitol. “I choose to stay in this fight because the Constitution is worth fighting for.”
Padilla, the first Latino to represent California in the Senate, gained national attention this summer after a video went viral of him being forced to the ground and detained at a press conference hosted by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. 
In his brief remarks, Padilla said he had received encouragement to run from people across the state, including business and labor leaders, people who approached him at his church, the grocery store and local parks. 
“Californians have urged me to do everything I could to protect California and the American Dream from this vindictive president,” Padilla said. “I’ve been truly honored and humbled by their encouragement, and I’ve taken it to heart.”
The crowded Democratic field still includes prominent names like former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, who made headlines for threatening to leave a televised CBS interview after the reporter asked questions she didn’t like, and former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. Former California State Controller Betty Yee, the only other female candidate still in the race, has called on Porter to drop out. 
Other Democrats still in the mix include former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villairaigosa, who lost to Newsom in 2018; former Attorney General Xavier Becerra, State Superintendent Tony Thurmond; former state Controller Betty Yee; and former Assemblyman Ian Charles Calderon. Prominent Republican challengers include Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and former Fox News contributor Steve Hilton.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/081425_Redistricting-Rally_TS_CM_14.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-04 16:02:47.583932

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)CARLISLE — While U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn and Iowa farmers said no one wants “handouts” from the government, they also said support is likely needed as the agriculture industry grapples with the recent impacts of tariff negotiations and the government shutdown.
Nunn, as well as Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig, held a roundtable discussion Tuesday with farmers at the Heartland Co-op in Carlisle. Tom Hauschel, CEO of the Heartland Co-Op, told reporters the business is “off to a very difficult start this year.”
“With the farm economy, what it has been, and crop size, with all the fungus and rust that we had, it’s the most stressful year we’ve had in the entire history of the cooperative,” Hauschel said. “… The pressure started at the farm gate, and now we’re feeling it at the retail level, and it’s going to be extremely difficult year. We need a long-term plan so that we can build this business and maintain our interests of our farm community that we serve. And today, we don’t have a long-term plan, and we’re feeling the effects of it.”
While many Iowa farmers and associated groups have said they felt encouraged by President Donald Trump’s trade deal with China last week, which included the purchase of soybeans in 2025 and future years, the effects of the president’s plans to renegotiate trade deals with other countries combined with other economic factors means many farmers are still predicting a tough year ahead.
The Creighton University Mid-America Business Conditions Index, a survey of bank CEOs in rural Iowa and other Midwestern states, found most bankers approved of Trump’s approach to trade with China, but that 85% supported providing farmers emergency federal payments in order to make up for the financial losses caused by recent international trade decisions.
Vernon Flinn, a farmer outside Des Moines, said “there’s not a farmer that I’ve ever spoke to that would like to have the money come from the government.” While farmers would prefer to just have the free market dictate prices, he said “short-term” financial help is needed.
“I think part of the problem we’re facing is brought on by the government,” Flinn said. “So I think the government’s got an obligation to help, maybe, bail guys out of it. I mean, with prices we’re facing today, with expenses if we’re looking out for planting a crop … yeah, there’s going to have to be help.”
Naig also said, “unfortunately, yes,” he believed the federal government should provide economic support for farmers in light of recent economic difficulties.
“We are in a situation where — because of the market conditions because of profitability and agriculture — we are in a situation where it gets a short-term fix,” Naig said. “I think that’s the point we’re trying to make here is the economics on the farm are real, and that has ripple effects into the rest of the economy — certainly an economy like Iowa, that’s ag and manufacturing base. So yes, but then, let’s make sure we’re focusing on the longer-term solutions here, which are markets, domestically and international.”
Nunn did not say directly if he would support bailouts for farmers but said he, alongside other Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration, want to focus on the long-term solutions needed to aid farmers. He highlighted portions of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” providing tax incentives for young and beginning farmers and permanently increasing estate tax exemptions, as well as his discussions with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on increasing domestic biofuel consumption through year-round E-15 and expanding the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit.
Nunn also said Trump’s approach to renegotiating trade deals and implementing tariffs is part of a long-term solution to support farmers.
“No farmer that I’ve ever talked to says they want a bailout,” Nunn said. “What they’d like to be able to do is expand their market. That’s both internationally, as the president just showed in his Asia trip, but it’s also domestically, something that the Biden administration failed to do for us for four years, something that this administration can do for us right now.”

Messages seeking comment from Alabama Democratic lawmakers were left Tuesday afternoon.
Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced benefits for SNAP were suspended for November. According to the Alabama Department of Human Resources, more than 726,000 Alabamians receive SNAP benefits, which is about 15% of the state population. Of that number, 330,000 (44%) are children, according to DHR.
DHR officials said SNAP benefits cost about $142 million a month.
The $2 million will be sent to the Community Food Bank of Central Alabama; the Food Bank of East Alabama; the Food Bank of North Alabama; Feeding the Gulf Coast; Heart of Alabama Food Bank; the Selma Area Food Bank; West Alabama Food Bank and the Wiregrass Area Food Bank.
A message seeking comment from Heart of Alabama Chief Development Officer Varina Mead was left Tuesday afternoon.
Feeding Alabama, a food bank network, said in a statement Tuesday afternoon that the money will help food banks expand operations.
“At a time when many Alabama families are facing heightened food insecurity, this investment will provide critical relief to food banks across the state, enabling them to increase food purchases, enhance distributions, expand operations, and ensure more Alabamians do not go hungry,” the company said in a statement.
A federal court on Saturday ordered the Trump administration to resume payments to SNAP beneficiaries by Wednesday. The Trump administration told a federal court Monday that it would use a contingency fund — which it had previously refused to employ — to pay about half the benefits for the month, though an official said that could take months. However, Trump said in a social media post on Tuesday that he would not obey the court order until the government shutdown ended.  
“There are real Alabama families who rely on SNAP to put food on their tables, and that includes more than 300,000 children, more than 102,000 seniors and those who are disabled,” the statement said. “We are now in the longest federal government shutdown in history, and it is absolutely ridiculous that families all across our country are suffering – whether that is the school children who rely on SNAP, the air traffic controller not receiving a paycheck or even our military and high number of federal government worker families in Alabama.”
According to the release, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins announced SNAP guidance has been sent to states to help partially fund the program while the federal government remains shut down. The team at Alabama DHR is closely reviewing those details today to act as quickly as possible, but timing is unknown.
Ivey also condemned U.S. Senate Democrats for not reopening the federal government. The federal government shutdown is a dispute over health care. Republicans in Congress lack the votes to overcome a budget filibuster. Democrats say they want a bipartisan agreement to extend looming cuts in subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans, which provide health insurance to nearly 478,000 Alabamians, according to KFF. Republicans said they won’t negotiate that until a stopgap spending bill is passed.

A federal judge has halted a logging project in the Kootenai National Forest, saying the federal government failed to correctly analyze the impacts to grizzly bears. 
The Knotty Pine Project, a 10-year project that would have authorized 7,465 acres of prescribed burning and 2,593 acres of commercial harvest in the Cabinet-Yaak Mountains, has been in litigation since 2022. 
The Center for Biological Diversity led a coalition of environmental groups including WildEarth Guardians and the Yaak Valley Forest Council, in suing the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, saying it could devastate the small group of grizzly bears that lives in the region due to increased roadwork. 
U.S. District Court Judge Dana Christensen granted a preliminary junction the following year, but issued his final ruling just last week. 
“The management of roads is one of the most powerful tools available to balance the needs of people with those of bears,” Christensen wrote. “High road densities in low elevation habitats may result in grizzly bear avoidance or displacement from important spring habitat and high mortality risks.”
Grizzly bears have a small presence in the Cabinet-Yaak ecosystem, estimated between 45 and 50. The stated goal of the federal government’s recovery plan for grizzlies in the ecosystem is 100, according to court documents. The latest report of the Cabinet-Yaak grizzly population states a goal of “zero human caused mortality,” though acknowledges this might not be realized due to the likelihood of human-bear conflicts. 
The Knotty Pine Project area consists of just more than 56,000 acres in Lincoln County, in the Three Rivers Ranger District. The industrial timber harvest and fuel treatments, which include “pre-commercial” thinning, would total just less than 10,000 acres, including authorization of prescribed burns totaling 7,465 acres.
The project would have also created 3.76 miles of “undetermined road,” 1.2 miles of temporary road construction, 4 miles of road storage and 35 miles of road maintenance. 
The substantial amount of roadwork was at the heart of the environmental groups’ lawsuit, as studies show roads displace bears and can shrink what is considered viable habitat. 
Christensen acknowledged the impact that roads have on grizzly bear habitat, citing documents from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services. 
“Such displacement can have multi-generational effects: “Females who have learned to avoid roads may also teach their cubs to avoid roads. In this way, learned avoidance behavior can persist for several generations of bears before they again utilize habitat associated with closed roads,” he wrote. 
The plaintiffs had argued that the federal government did not adequately conduct its analysis, mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act,  and violated the Endangered Species Act when considering the impact of roads on grizzly habitat. They also argued that a number of roads that should be closed to the public are accessed anyways, and these illegal uses should be taken into consideration for the project area’s overall impact. 
The Forest Service argued it had “noted that the use of closed roads is illegal,” was monitoring illegal use, and tracked when gates or barriers needed repairing, but Christensen said that such considerations didn’t go far enough. 
“By excluding illegal roads, FWS makes an ‘unsupported assumption’ that illegal roads have no effect on grizzly bears. Such an assumption fails to ‘err on the side of the bear,’” Christensen said. 
“For too long the Forest Service has ignored illegal off-road vehicle use, the presence of unauthorized roads and the harm they inflict on grizzly bears,” Adam Rissien, rewilding manager with WildEarth Guardians, said in a press release. “This ruling affirms that the Forest Service must account for illegal road use, including on ‘zombie roads,’ which the agency pretends don’t exist until they come back to life for logging projects.”
Christensen ruled in favor of the environmental groups in most of their claims that the federal government violated NEPA by not fully accounting for illegal road use and the effects on grizzly bears for the total scope of the project. 
However, on a claim that the Forest Service did not analyze the impact of pre-commercial thinning activities on grizzlies, Christensen sided with the federal government, and said the impacts were “thoroughly considered.” 
“This decision is a critical win for the Cabinet-Yaak’s struggling grizzly bears,” Kristine Akland, Northern Rockies director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “For decades federal agencies have turned a blind eye while roads carved up bear country, and grizzly bears have paid the price. The court’s ruling sends a clear message that the government can’t ignore facts or the law when it comes to protecting grizzlies.”

The Mid Vermont Christian School is challenging Vermont’s education reform law in federal court, arguing that the law’s set of provisions around public tuition dollars “creates a religious gerrymander and discriminates against religious approved independent schools in Vermont.”
The school’s filing seeks to insert a new challenge to the 2025 law into a lawsuit already underway in the U.S. District Court in Vermont. The school filed the original lawsuit against the state in 2023 after it was banned from participating in state athletics because it forfeited against a team with a transgender player. A federal appeals court in September ruled in the school’s favor and said its teams must be allowed to participate, but returned the case to the lower court for further action.
The school and families are represented in that case by lawyers with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a prominent conservative Christian legal group that has had a growing presence in Vermont education and politics.

This new motion, filed on Oct. 31, challenges Act 73, the sweeping education reform bill signed into law by Republican Gov. Phil Scott in July. The Quechee-based, pre-K-12 school said in court filings that the law “now gerrymanders out and excludes all religious schools from public benefits.”
The law injures the plaintiffs — several Mid Vermont Christian School students and their families, as well as the school itself — by preventing them from using public tuition dollars for the school because of the new provisions in the law, the motion argues.
The filing further suggests that state lawmakers, “knowing the state couldn’t blatantly exclude just religious schools,” worked during the last legislative session to “gerrymander them out by redefining which approved independent schools could receive public tuition.”
“Vermont has yet again excluded all private religious schools and their families from receiving generally available public benefits,” the complaint reads.
The complaint names Vermont Education Secretary Zoie Saunders, as well as the State Board of Education and Vermont Principals’ Association as defendants. Toren Ballard, Vermont Agency of Education’s director of policy and communications, declined to comment on the pending litigation. The agency is being represented by the Office of the Vermont Attorney General.
Vermont’s public tuition system allows families in districts without a public school for certain grades to use public dollars to send their children to public schools or private schools (called independent schools in state law).
But under the new law, private schools must pass certain requirements to remain eligible for public funding: They must be located in a school district or supervisory union that does not operate a public school for some or all grades, and they must have had at least 25% of their student body from the 2023-24 school year funded by a Vermont public school district.
As a result, 18 private schools remain eligible for public tuition dollars. Students who were already enrolled in ineligible schools prior to the law’s passing can continue receiving public dollars until they graduate.
The new eligibility requirements halted the flow of public dollars toward religious schools, which had increased following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 decision in the Carson v. Makin case.
That case held that Maine, which runs a similar tuition funding program to Vermont’s, could not award some parents a “public benefit,” specifically, tuition money, while in other cases “denying the benefit based on a recipient’s religious exercise.”
As a result, more than a dozen religious schools in Vermont, like Rice Memorial High School, Mount St. Joseph Academy and Mid Vermont Christian School, had in recent years received a growing amount of public tuition dollars.
Mid Vermont Christian School in its complaint called the new eligibility requirements in Act 73 “an attempted work-around” to recent court cases and suggested state lawmakers designed the law’s tuition provisions to exclude religious schools.
The complaint specifically pointed to the law’s 25% public-funding floor, calling it “an arbitrary line that does not further any legitimate governmental purpose.”
“The public-funding floor was created by Vermont legislators so that certain, favored, secular approved independent schools would continue to be able to receive town tuition funding and religious schools could not,” the complaint reads.
The Alliance Defending Freedom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Legal experts had previously cast doubt over whether litigation challenging Act 73’s eligibility rules would be successful. The plaintiffs would have to make the case that lawmakers developed their legislation around public tuition funding specifically to exclude religious schools — “an extremely hard case to make,” Vermont Law School’s Peter Teachout said previously.
In order to consider the substance of that argument, the court will first have to decide whether to allow the challenge to Act 73 to be combined into the previously existing case, a move that the motion states the Office of the Vermont Attorney General plans to oppose.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) A plurality of North Carolinians hold President Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress responsible for the federal government shutdown, a new Catawba College-YouGov poll found, but Democrats and “all elected officials” are also taking blame.
Asked who they think is “most responsible for the current government shutdown,” 22.8% of respondents answered the Republican Party, and an additional 18% answered the president — a combined 40.8%. Just under 5% said they didn’t know.
However, the minority party did not escape blame from poll respondents: 29.1% said they felt the Democratic Party was most responsible for the shutdown. And just over a quarter (25.2%) of those polled said “all elected officials are equally responsible.”
The poll comes as the shutdown drags into its second full month, with congressional leaders unable to come to an agreement on funding the government. The ripples of that shutdown have begun to impact wide swaths of North Carolinians, with SNAP food aid reduced and federal health care tax credits in danger of expiring.
Democrats have called on Republicans, who hold majorities in Congress, to pass a full government spending bill that includes a renewal of those health care tax credits, among other key measures. Republicans have pushed for a more narrowly tailored spending bill, while accusing Democrats of leveraging the shutdown for political gain.
And while the parties loudly blame each other for the shutdown’s negative impacts, voters remain divided on who, exactly, is most to blame.
“With this latest shutdown close to becoming the longest in American history, the division among North Carolina partisans reflects the nation’s divided state,” said Michael Bitzer, professor of politics and history at Catawba College.
Among those who self-identified as Democrats, a combined 68% said either Trump or Republicans were most responsible. Almost 56% of Republicans said Democrats were most responsible.
However, self-identified independents, who made up 35.8% of those polled, assigned blame to both parties: 34% of them said “all elected officials were equally responsible.” While 25.9% of independents held Democrats responsible for the shutdown, 17.8% blamed Trump and 17% blamed Republicans.
The Catawba-YouGov online poll of 1,000 North Carolinians was conducted from Oct. 16-24. It has a margin of error of +/- 3.79 percentage points.
The poll also surveyed North Carolinians’ concerns about rising prices. Catawba will release further results on approval ratings, the response to Hurricane Helene and a range of other political and government issues later this week.

Such activities are defined by the Trump administration as supporting undocumented immigrants and promoting diversity and transgender advocacy, the latter described as “engaging in the chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children.”
The 22 Democratic AGs claim those revisions effectively give the U.S. Department of Education broad authority to target specific activities disfavored by the Trump administration.
“To accomplish this goal, the rule purports to empower the Department of Education to serve as a roving enforcer of the administration’s animus by stripping PSLF eligibility from employers whose actions it dislikes,” the lawsuit states. “Put simply, the final rule is nothing more than a laundry list of this administration’s policy priorities designed to attack lawful conduct it does not agree with.”
The AGs argue the rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act and exceeds the Education Department’s authority.
Joining Rhode Island and Massachusetts in the suit are AGs from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.
Created under then-president Geroge W. Bush in 2007, the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program allows government and nonprofit to apply to have their remaining federal student loans canceled after 10 years of service and monthly loan payments.
The coalition is asking the court to declare the rule unlawful and block the new rules from taking effect next year — as does a separate lawsuit filed in Massachusetts by a group of nonprofits and city and county governments.
“Bending the knee to this president cannot and will not be a prerequisite for this program, and we will fight to ensure that politics remains untethered to what it means to be a public servant in America,” Neronha said in a statement Monday. “Public service knows no political party.”
Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent called the revisions “common sense.”
“It is unconscionable that the plaintiffs are standing up for criminal activity,” he said in a statement to Rhode Island Current Tuesday. “The final rule is crystal clear: the Department will enforce it neutrally, without consideration of the employer’s mission, ideology, or the population they serve.”
The case has been assigned to Judge Myong J. Joun, a Biden nominee.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Highway Patrol, in partnership with federal immigration forces, arrested 73 people during a second operation targeting drivers without legal immigration status. 
The most recent operation was held over two days last week near the Oklahoma-Arkansas border on Interstate 40. Troopers spoke with about 500 people and arrested 73 for being in the country without legal status. Of those arrested, 34 of which were commercial truck drivers, said Oklahoma Commissioner of Public Safety Tim Tipton. 
It marked the second sting under Operation Guardian that has resulted in a total of nearly 200 people being detained on immigration violations while traveling along I-40, he said. 
The first operation was held in September in western Oklahoma. It resulted in law enforcement speaking with 520 people and making 120 arrests for alleged immigration violations. 
Both operations involved traffic stops and inspections at Oklahoma’s ports of entry. 
As part of the state’s partnership with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, all Highway Patrol troopers are credentialed under ICE. This allows state officers to carry out some federal immigration enforcement, including questioning immigration status and search and seizure, Tipton said. 
The training is provided by ICE and there’s a potential for federal reimbursement for the state, Tipton said. He did not detail what Oklahoma’s federal reimbursement could amount to. 
“Our normal trooper out there working his normal assignment, taking calls for service, working collisions, dealing with intoxicated drivers, all the variety of things that a trooper does on a daily basis,” he said. “This just gives them the ability that if in their normal course of duty, they run across somebody who is here illegally, then they have, one, the authority to question them about their immigration status, and then, two, to also take immigration enforcement based under federal under federal law.”
Highway Patrol is accompanied by ICE during these operations at Oklahoma’s ports of entry, Tipton said. 
“We set up a command post at the port, we provide troopers, our emergency response troopers, that come out to process them,” he said. “It’s really a mass arrest event once you do that, when you have hundreds of people that you’re detaining.”
The troopers make the arrests, process and transport the arrested individuals to a local ICE office in partnership with the Department of Public Safety or the Department of Corrections, Tipton said. ICE then can process and transport the individuals “wherever within the federal system they need to go.” 
Tipton said the “majority” of those arrested had a criminal history or “other factors that play into why they are a true threat.”
“It is dangerous to our citizens when we have people who are here, illegally, untrained, operating these types of vehicles,” he said. “And so it is a true public safety issue that we will aggressively enforce.”
During last week’s enforcement operation, Tipton said social media posts warned drivers as far as North and South Carolina to reroute around Oklahoma because of Operation Guardian.
“There are other states that have credentialed certain divisions within their state agencies, but with the intelligence that we see, as soon as you get an operation going, word is being spread amongst those who are driving illegally to route around,” Tipton said. “Until there’s a concerted effort across the country to be able to stop that rerouting and do it in a systematic approach.”

(Leah Romero for Source NM) Santa Fe voters say they are ready for a new mayor
Shortly after 9 a.m. Tuesday morning, a line of voters stretched out the door at the Santa Fe County Fairgrounds polling location. Poll worker Maria Dolores Lopez told Source NM she’d counted 164 voters within the first hour of the location opening.
“Good morning!” she said to everyone who entered the building. “Happy voting day!”

Her job as a greeter, she said, “is to smile at people and make them feel welcome.” As for the line out the door: “I’ve never seen that before,” she told Source.
While local elections typically draw much smaller numbers than those with national races, Tuesday’s eight-person Santa Fe mayoral election to succeed Alan Webber, who is not seeking a third term, had drawn a crowd—at least in one location.
Victor Saiz, 81, summed it up succinctly when asked what brought him out.
“I want a new mayor,” he said.
As of mid-morning Tuesday, the New Mexico Secretary of State’s Office reported 32,488 people statewide had voted on election day, with races in about half of the state’s 33 counties. With early and absentee ballots, that brings the total votes so far to 197,488, or approximately 14% of the state’s registered voters.
Voter turnout in the 2023 local elections hit approximately 20.5%, versus 69% for the presidential general election the following year.
In Santa Fe County, about 18% of registered voters had cast ballots by mid-morning. In addition to the mayoral race, Santa Fe has several city council and school board races, along with local bond and ballot measures.
Even without a national race, the political climate had been palpable on the campaign trail, mayoral candidate Oscar Rodriguez told Source.

“I’ve heard two sides,” said Rodriguez, during a stop at the fairgrounds, “and we’ll see today what the net effect is. One side is saying that they’re just burned out [with] all of this bad news. It makes people…feel they don’t want to hear anymore, and they don’t want to participate and that’s bad. But I’ve also heard on the other side, people who are very motivated because of what’s happening. That’s certainly been a big part of my message: It’s a month into the shutdown and the federal government retreating from economic development, from housing, health care, SNAP being cut off, so don’t you want to look to your local government and rally around your local government so you can least locally solve the problem that you need to have solved?”
While current Mayor Webber is not seeking re-election, his name surfaced among both candidates and voters at the fairgrounds.

Former longtime City Councilor Ron Trujillo, making his second mayoral bid, said basic infrastructure surfaced frequently as a topic on the campaign trail. “I think people are tired of Santa Fe not looking like a capital city,” he said. “I mean, everywhere you go” Cerrillos Road, Siringo Road, there’s weeds, there’s trash on the road. This is not how a capital city should look. And it’s not about tourism. It’s about those of us that call Santa Fe our home 24/7: We deserve to have a city that looks clean and that functions well.”
Voter Natasha Marsh-Lovato said she was casting her vote for mayoral candidate and current City Councilor Michael Garcia. “I like him as a city councilor,” she said. “I like the plan that he has. His 10-year plan is great: wanting to bring the life back into parks…and bring in some programs for the kids and for children that were taken away.”
Voter Natasha Marsh-Lovato told Source NM she thinks it’s important to participate in local and national politics. (Julia Goldberg/Source NM)
Voter Stacey Foiles said she also had cast her ballot for Garcia. She moved here from Portland, Oregon, she said, where Webber also lived and worked for Portland Mayor Neil Goldschmidt.
“I didn’t like him there, so I was not surprised that I didn’t like him here,” Foiles said of Webber. “I think it’s really important in a place like Santa Fe that it not become a place where the people who settled it and who lived here even before Western settlers came can’t afford to live here anymore.”
Voter Jamie Aranda, author of the children’s book ​​Zozo’s Adventure and the Flame of Hope, did not want to reveal her mayoral choice, but said she’d been engaged with local politics for a long time. “I think it’s really important for our community to be here and show up and vote. I’m multi-generational from Santa Fe, New Mexico, so I just want my voice to be heard,” she said.
Gregory Gutin arrived at the polls on bicycle, mildly breathless, with the same thought. “Everybody should vote right?” he said. “We have to take advantage of that,because it’s the one thing we can do to help create change and—you know—it’s also everybody coming together to decide who will be our leaders.”

In Albuquerque, voters want a say on local issues

Voters in Albuquerque are weighing in on whether Mayor Tim Keller should get an unprecedented third consecutive term in office. If he doesn’t get 50% of the vote when all Tuesday voters are tallied, he will join one of four opponents in a runoff that takes place Dec. 4.
In a recent public appearance, Keller suggested he thought the election Tuesday would lead to a runoff. He asked fellow members of the New Mexico State Fair District Board to schedule their next meeting in mid-December, because he’d be otherwise occupied until Dec. 4, he said. 
His opponents are former Bernalillo County Sheriff Darren White, former federal prosecutor Alexander Uballez, City Councilor Louie Sanchez, former Albuquerque Fire Chief Eddie Varela and former Sandoval County Deputy Manager Mayling Armijo.
Also on the ballot are school district races, seats on the local Soil and Water Conservation District Board and several City Council seats.
Three Albuquerque voters who spoke to Source New Mexico at two Downtown Albuquerque polling locations said they were motivated to have a say on local issues, especially amid federal chaos. As of publication, voter turnout in Bernalillo County, which includes Albuquerque, was running at 21.5%.

“There’s a lot going on in the country, and I think there’s a lot of cruelty,” voter Radiance LaJeunesse told Source outside a polling place at Washington Middle School. “And even if it’s just a tiny little voice, I know I’m a part of that, and that I’m on the right side.”
She said she makes sure to encourage those in her life to vote in local elections and recently convinced her boyfriend to register for the first time. She likened voting for school board candidates and general obligation bonds to joining the recent nationwide No Kings protest, an act of resistance she also found inspiring.

While voter Florie Alise said she voted for Keller, she said voting to approve general obligation bonds was what compelled her to take time to vote Tuesday at the middle school. 
She said she voted “mainly to maintain the financial support that agencies and government needs to advance,” she said. “I mean, the city needs money.”
She said she voted “yes” on every bond question to approve more than $160 million in bonds toward police, schools, homelessness and other issues. 
Simonna Avalos joined a trickle of voters at the Hernan Sanchez Community Center in Albuquerque’s Barelas neighborhood on Tuesday morning. As a worker for the state Health Care Authority overseeing emergency food assistance payments, she said she’s seen first-hand how important state and local governments can be in the face of federal dysfunction. 
But she said what most motivated her to cast a ballot Tuesday is that she’s a single mother whose son attends a nearby middle school. 
“These are our local communities. These are our neighbors. These are our families,” she said.

School, council races draw Las Cruces voters

Las Cruces voters lined up inside the Doña Ana County Government Center Tuesday morning to cast their ballots in the local elections, which include several city council seats, Las Cruces Public Schools Board of Education seats, a Doña Ana Soil & Water Conservation Board seat and several general obligation bond questions. Turnout as of publication was running at about 12%.
Other races on the ballot in the surrounding county communities include Mesilla, Anthony, Sunland Park and Hatch board of trustees or city council positions; Anthony and Hatch mayoral seats; Gadsden Independent School District and Hatch Valley Schools board positions; the Caballo Soil & Water Conservation District; and the Lower Rio Grande Public Water Works Authority. 
Jamie Villagrana, a teacher at Monte Vista Elementary School in Las Cruces’ East Mesa, told Source New Mexico that the two school tax questions were the main motivating factors for her to vote Tuesday. The Las Cruces Public Schools General Obligation School Bond question proposes issuing up to $65 million in school bonds for school infrastructure construction and renovations, technology and matching funds for state-funded capital projects. The LCPS School Buildings Levy question proposes renewing the $3 levy per $1,000 of net taxable property value between 2026 and 2031 to support school capital improvements, technology, transportation and facility maintenance. 
“We want everything. We need everything,” Villagrana, a 27-year educator, said. 
Michelle Ramsey, a mother of two elementary students in Las Cruces, told Source that she voted against the two school bond questions because she does not like how the school system is currently operating. 
“I need to protect my kids,” she said. “I’m a Godly woman so I want to go back to bringing God into school.”
James Moore, a 27-year resident of Las Cruces, told Source that he wasn’t motivated to vote because of any race or question in particular. “It’s all important,” he said.

Doña Ana County Chief Deputy Clerk Caroline Zamora told Source that polls in the 42 locations throughout the county were quiet Tuesday morning with no reported issues. She said that the nine secure containers in the county are available for people to drop off absentee ballots before 7 p.m. 
She added that most of the calls her office has received about elections are about state races, which will not be held until November 2026. 
Zamora said that at least one of the Las Cruces City Council races has a write-in candidate and because the council races are determined using ranked choice voting, the ballots will have to be adjudicated individually.
“For sure they’ll have first-round tonight. But depending on if that candidate makes it past the first round, we might not have the results for that until tomorrow,” Zamora said.

The weather may have had an effect on morning turnout, with some polling places reporting a slight — though steady — trickle of voters in the first hours of voting. 
“Voter turnout so far at the polls is very slow,” Dianne Slopak, one of Norwich’s registrars of voters, said in an email Tuesday morning. While it was too son to know what the full day’s turnout would be, Slopak said early voting — which ran Oct. 20 to Nov. 2 — was around 2,000 ballots, or 10% of the electorate. 
That number was lower than the roughly 25% of voters who cast early ballots last year, but it was within expectations for an off-cycle municipal election. 
Others viewed the start of the day more optimistically. 
“Early voting definitely ate up much of the foot traffic,” said Kevin Saythany, the chair of the Norwich Democratic Town Committee and a candidate for the local Board of Education. Gripping his puffer jacket closed as he stood outside the polls at the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, Saythany said voter education had activated new parts of the electorate. 
“In terms of voter turnout for early voting, Norwich is in the top 10, and now we’re like the top three in terms of turnout,” he said. “So that’s great.”

By the afternoon, things were beginning to shift. At John B. Stanton Elementary, one of the busier polling places in Norwich, more than 400 voters had turned out by midday. 
And for those who braved the cold, coming out on Election Day was an important way to make a statement. “I feel like it’s my responsibility to vote,” said Ellen Carenza, who briefly chatted with the Connecticut Mirror after voting at the John Moriarty Elementary School, the city’s first precinct polling place. 
“I believe in certain things that I want for our country, and the way I can get that action is through voting,” she added.
Election Day turnout for the West Hartford election hit about 10.8% by midday Tuesday, and West Hartford Town Hall was busy as people squeezed into elevators up to the voting booths on the third floor.
“It seems like a normal municipal election,” Elizabeth Rousseau, one of the two West Hartford registrars of voters said.
In Hartford, however, voter turnout was lower. Residents were voting only on candidates to fill three school board seats, and two of the races were uncontested. By midday, fewer 4,000 voters had visited the polls — around 6.2% of all active registered voters in the city.
U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, was visiting polling places across many towns in her district Tuesday, offering her support for local Democratic candidates. 
“The local elections are bellwethers for how people are feeling about what’s happening overall,” she said. “People are looking for change in some of these areas and want to see a vision for the future, where we should take our cities and towns. I think that’s also going to be true at the national level.”
DeLauro said she observed “steady” turnout in the communities she visited, including Ansonia, Milford, Woodbridge, Hamden and Stratford.
In Stratford, the congresswoman stood next to Democratic mayoral candidate David Chess, who is challenging Republican incumbent Mayor Laura Hoydick, outside the polling location at Stratford High School. “We have opportunities to pick up seats. I think we will pick up seats,” she said.
This is Chess’ first run for elected office. He said he’s knocked on more than 5,000 doors.
“It’s been very exciting and there’s been tremendous enthusiasm,” Chess said Tuesday. “People are excited. They’re hungry for change, they’re hungry for hope.”
Lisa Noble, an Ansonia resident who works as an attendance specialist at Stratford public schools, said she was excited for Election Day and she hoped local races could help shift national politics toward being, “a little more centered and kinder to each other.”

Noble said she was driven to the polls this year because the effects of the government shutdown have hit home. She wore rainbow-colored socks and a T-shirt emblazoned with the phrase, “All for love and love for all.”
“I have a 31-year-old son who didn’t get his food stamps. What happens to the people who are intellectually disabled and don’t get their food stamps?” Noble said.
Takira Gill, a polling place supervisor in Bridgeport’s District 133, said voter turnout was steady Tuesday. “I feel like a lot of people in this district are coming out to vote,” she said. “I thought it was going to be slower, but no.”
Bryson Moore, a Bridgeport parent, said he’s deeply invested in his community and he wants local leaders who will address educational disparities. “Top of mind was definitely the Board of education,” he said.
“I just want to make sure that I’m doing my part. I’m living here, my kids go to school here, so I just want to make sure that I’m doing my part,” Moore said.

(Jeremy Stevens for Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana State Police has confirmed its gaming division is exploring allegations of financial misconduct at Coushatta Casino Resort in Kinder, where multiple federal agencies are already looking into claims that the tribe’s former chairman used a casino credit card without tribal permission to help build and furnish his personal home.
The financial fraud allegations involve the tribe’s former chairman, Jonathan Cernek, and two former employees of the casino; Todd Stewart, who was the general manager and chief financial officer; and Paula Corliss, the venue’s purchasing manager.
Details of alleged credit card misuse were revealed in an independent audit submitted to the Louisiana Legislative Auditor and in documents Stewart provided last year to the Coushatta Tribal Council. 
Cernek resigned as tribal chairman in August 2024 without explanation.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Lt. Robert Dowdy, with the Louisiana State Police Gaming Enforcement Division, cited an “ongoing investigation” when asked via email about Cernek, Stewart and Corliss. The law enforcement agency receives regular reports from the tribe and coordinates oversight daily with the Coushatta Tribal Gaming Commission, he said. 
Cernek and Stewart have not responded to calls and emails seeking comment for this report.
In a telephone interview, Corliss said Louisiana State Police has not contacted her and declined to answer additional questions about its investigation. She previously told the Illuminator the FBI interviewed her in person in May 2024 about the Coushatta Casino’s finances, and she spoke with someone from the Bureau of Indian Affairs in October 2024 on the same topic. 
The FBI and Bureau of Indian Affairs declined to respond to questions about the Coushatta Tribe, citing the ongoing federal government shutdown. The FBI typically does not confirm or deny whether it is conducting investigations.
In a letter dated Sept. 8, the National Indian Gaming Commission ordered the Coushatta Tribe’s casino oversight panel to hold hearings on revoking Stewart’s gaming license. Corliss, who no longer worked for the casino, was “entitled to a hearing” about her license status but did not request one. The Coushatta Tribal Gaming Commission suspended her license about a week later. Stewart, whose final day working for the casino was Sept. 7, had his license revoked Friday.
The National Indian Gaming Commission did not respond to questions about Cernek and the Coushatta Casino. 
As scrutiny into the casino’s management continues, local police are investigating a shooting at the home of the Coushatta Tribe’s current chairman. At approximately 11:15 p.m. Sunday night, a gunshot hit the home of David Sickey, the tribe said in a statement. No injuries were reported. 
A bullet went through the bedroom window of Sickey’s minor child, who was sleeping at the time, according to the statement. Police provided a photo of a slug recovered from the bedroom. The Jefferson Davis Parish Sheriff’s Office, the Coushatta Tribal Police and federal agencies are investigating the incident.
The Sickey family residence is outside the town of Iowa, about 45 minutes away from the Coushatta reservation.
Fraud allegation background
Details of alleged credit card misuse were outlined in an eight-page statement Stewart provided to the Coushatta Tribal Council last year. The Illuminator obtained a copy of the letter that spells out accusations dating back to November 2023. They include Stewart’s discovery of invoices for deliveries to the home of Cernek and his wife, Mandy, citing “bathroom fixtures” as an example. 
Corliss confirmed many of these details in a prior interview with the Illuminator, adding that she believed “nothing was hidden” about the Cerneks’ use of the casino credit card.
It was a year after she left her job at the casino that Corliss said she received notice of her gaming license suspension from the Coushatta Tribal Gaming Commission in a letter dated Sept. 19. The letter said Corliss violated commission regulations by failing to cooperate with its investigation – an allegation she said is untrue.
“They had to investigate without me. Nobody ever asked me anything from the [Coushatta Tribal Gaming] Commission. I don’t know how much more I could cooperate,” she said.
Mary Patricia Wray, a spokesperson for the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana, provided a written statement regarding the end of Corliss’ employment at the casino. 
“Ms. Corliss’ employee records indicate that she was terminated while an ‘at will’ employee,” the statement reads. “There was no reason required for her termination, and as such, the documents do not reflect a reason. Prior to her separation, she violated casino security protocols.” There were no further details on Corliss’ breach of security protocols in the statement.
Corliss, who had worked for the casino for nearly 30 years, said she believes she was let go because Cernek, three weeks after he resigned as tribal chairman, came into her office unannounced and she did not call security.
“He told me that he had reached out to the [tribal] elders, or some elders, and apologized. He said, ‘I hurt my family, I hurt the tribe. I hurt the associates here,’” Corliss said, adding that Cernek did not mention credit card use during their conversation.
In its letter calling for Stewart’s license status to be reviewed, the National Indian Gaming Commission said Stewart did not “disclose suspected fraud to the external auditors” and withheld the same information from “the potential lender of a $150 million construction loan the Coushatta Casino was in the process of obtaining” until the loan was actually secured.
Stewart said in his statement to the Coushatta Tribal Council that when he was working to secure the loan, “any potential ‘bleeding’ had been stopped and we were therefore dealing with historical activity that had already occurred.”
The Coushatta Tribal Council met Saturday, but it is unknown whether the casino’s financial matters or ongoing investigations were discussed. As a sovereign nation, the tribe’s meetings are not subject to the state’s open meetings law.

Hartford and New Haven saw large increases in Republican voter registration, each with over 1,000 more Republican voters in 2025 than in 2021. This gain nearly doubled the number of registered Republicans in both cities, but the party still sits strongly in the minority state-wide by nearly 303,000 voters.
While Democrats still hold a strong majority, the party lost over 32,000 active voters from 2021 to 2025. Many towns saw decreases in overall voter registration but increases in Republican Party registration.
John Carlson, a former New Haven mayoral candidate and the current chair of the New Haven Republican Town Committee, said he isn’t surprised by the increase. Carlson  attributed much of the change in New Haven to a part of the larger national trend.
“People are angry with the Democrat party,” Carlson said. “That’s really the single biggest reason, is that they’re angry with Democrat party and they identify with Republicans.”
Carlson sited the “Walk Away” campaign, a social media movement founded in 2018 encouraging voters to leave the Democratic Party, as a possible reason behind the change. 
But in New Haven specifically, where the Republican Party jumped from 2,655 voters in 2021 to 3,801 voters in 2025, a 43.16% increase, Carlson said there may be an additional explanation.
“New Haven Republicans, we represent New Haven. We’re a very diverse group, and our candidates reflect that,” Carlson said. “And many people, because of our candidates, have registered Republican.”
There are numerous races on ballot this week in New Haven, including the mayoral race, where incumbent Democrat Justin Elicker is running against Republican Steve Orosco.
Hartford saw very similar changes as New Haven, with active Republican voters increasing by nearly 1,200 in 2025 compared to 2021. In 2021, registered Republicans made up just over 4% of total active Hartford voters but now make up 5.8%.
This trend, according to Sweets Wilson, a chairperson on the Hartford Republican Town Committee, may be attributed to numerous factors across the city and the state.
“What I think overall could be happening is there are various segments — faith based, women’s rights, racial equality, justice — and you know, these different divisions are now taking a look at in the past, how have blues really served their particular interests,” Wilson said.
In Hartford, there is only one office on the ballot — the city’s Board of Education.
While the largest jumps in registered Republicans occurred in some of Connecticut’s larger cities, the trend occurred in many towns across the state. 
Lisa Milone is the Republican registrar of voters in New Haven and the secretary for the Connecticut Republican Party. She said she’s been active in the New Haven Republican Party for the past 10 years and has seen recent shifts in voter mindset.
“People are starting to really want their voices heard, and I’m finding that more people want to get involved and do things or see change,” Milone said. “And secondly, there’s a lot of voters that are probably taking a closer look at how the local and state policies are affecting our day-to-day lives.”
Milone, who is also a member of the New Haven Republican Town Committee, said the organization has conducted a lot of voter outreach and education within the city. She has seen first-hand an increase in interest in local issues. 
But this trend isn’t unique to New Haven, Milone said. 
“I think that the increase in the Republican registration reflects probably a growing desire for balance and accountability,” Milone said. “I think a lot of residents want to be a part of shaping local decisions. They’re getting more involved locally, and I don’t necessarily think that’s only New Haven.”
Milone said that, on the state level, there has been a stronger Republican presence across the state. She said there are stronger campaigns being run by Republicans where people are “putting their best foot forward.”
“There is a shift,” Milone said. 
But Milone said that for today’s election, she just hopes people come to the polls.
“You know, regardless of the outcome, I really hope a really good voter turnout.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ELECTION-DAY-1104-SR-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-04 15:01:40.030576

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Building on a temporary state-level version of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) announced last week, state agencies are collaborating on a food drive effort to further bolster food-insecure communities around Virginia, Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced Tuesday morning.
Dubbed the Virginia Cares Initiative, people are encouraged to sign up to donate food and money to the state’s regional food banks. Participants will then receive a list of high-demand food items, drop off locations and hours of operation for the banks.
Virginia SNAP substitute to roll out weekly through November

Director of the Federation of Virginia Food Banks Eddie Oliver thanked Youngkin for spearheading support efforts at the state level and emphasized how Virginia’s food banks and a “network of 1,150 pantry partners are facing a perfect storm of challenges.”
“We know there are still thousands of families, including federal workers and newly eligible Virginians, who are struggling to make ends meet as the Democrat Shutdown continues,” Youngkin said. “The Virginia Cares Initiative ensures that our communities can step forward to bridge that gap, especially as we approach Thanksgiving.”
With the federal government paused since the start of October due to a congressional impasse on funding bills, SNAP beneficiaries and furloughed federal workers have gone without payments that they rely on. SNAP supports low-income families and people who cannot work so that they can purchase groceries. 
Partisanship has flared anew as Republicans like Youngkin have blamed Democrats for the shutdown because they’ve sought extensions of Affordable Care Act subsidies. Democrats have pointed out that Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House, and that the steep spending cuts that have gummed up negotiations emanate from the GOP. The U.S. Senate has continued to meet yet they’ve failed to agree on resolutions, while the U.S. House has not gaveled in since September.
A coalition of Democrat-led states successfully sued President Donald Trump’s administration, with a judge ordering that earmarked contingency funds be disbursed to states for SNAP. The United States Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, will now be compelled to release the funding. 
But a Tuesday morning social media post from Trump indicates that states shouldn’t expect SNAP funds as long as the government is shut down — despite the court ruling that his administration must pay using at least some of the USDA contingency funds. 
“There are no words. Hungry kids are not a bargaining chip. Choosing to let millions go hungry is unspeakably cruel,” Virginia U.S. Senator Mark Warner said on X in response to Trump’s post.. 
Hours after Trump’s post in defiance of the court order, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said at a press conference that the administration will comply.  
“The administration is fully complying with the court order, I just spoke to the president about it,” she said. “The recipients of these SNAP benefits need to understand it’s going to take some time to receive this money because the Democrats have forced the administration into a very untenable position.”
The Mercury had reached out to the White House Monday morning asking for details on when states might expect some funding but did not receive a response by Tuesday afternoon. 
In the meantime, the Virginia Emergency Nutrition Assistance (VENA) disbursed the first wave of money to recipients this past Monday. 
Announced last week by Youngkin and modeled after SNAP, it will roll out benefits in waves — the second wave will hit Wednesday and the third wave on Friday. Unlike SNAP, which awards beneficiaries once a month, VENA will provide smaller weekly payments through the end of November using an estimated $37.5 million of the state’s budget surplus per week to aid Virginia’s roughly 850,000 eligible recipients. 
“We will continue to distribute funds as scheduled to ensure Virginians in need don’t go hungry,” Youngkin spokesperson Peter Finocchio said in an email Tuesday. “We continue to work closely with our federal partners and will provide updates as federal guidance changes. The Governor’s priority remains ensuring that all eligible individuals and families continue to have immediate access to food support.”

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderIt’s election day in Georgia for two Public Service Commission seats, and voters are making their voices heard over who should sit on a board that helps determine Georgia’s energy policy and the rates customers pay for utilities like electricity and gas.
Republican incumbents Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson are fighting to keep their seats from Democratic challengers Alicia Johnson and Peter Hubbard in an off-year race that’s garnered more attention than usual because of the implications the results may have on next year’s midterm elections.
Republicans want to send a message that the GOP still reigns supreme in Georgia, while Democrats are hoping that a strong showing will give them momentum heading into next year, when the party is hoping to flip statewide seats from the governor down and defend Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff’s spot in Washington.
Democrats are largely pinning their hopes on the idea that voters will be frustrated with Republican leadership at the state and federal level and want to make their voices heard.

“It’s the same reason you go online and you see more negative reviews about something,” said Patrick McGann, a Cherokee County network systems engineer who cast a ballot for Alicia Johnson and Hubbard Tuesday at Clark Creek Elementary School in Acworth. “If someone’s upset about something, they’re more likely to come out and vote, especially in an off-cycle like this, so don’t upset your constituents.”
Cherokee County, which sits on the northern edge of the Atlanta suburbs, is a huge source of Republican votes in Georgia — Republican President Donald Trump won the county with nearly 70% of the vote in 2024. But Democrats have had their eyes on the county as well. As metro Atlanta continues to grow outward, Democrats are hoping to make inroads with new, younger and more diverse Cherokee residents.
In 2024, voters at the Clark Creek precinct favored Trump by nearly 12 points, but many  of the voters exiting the polls shortly after they opened Tuesday morning said they cast ballots for Alicia Johnson and Hubbard.
University employee Karen Sender. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Among them was Karen Sender, a university employee who said Tuesday was her first time voting in a non-national election.
“It’s really just to make my voice heard,” she said. “It’s been a disappointing year so far with how the nation’s been going, so I wanted to get my voice out there.”
Sender said she’s not directly affected by Georgia Power rate increases. The commission has approved six Georgia Power-requested rate increases in two years, raising the average household’s power bill by $43 per month.
“I get my power through Cobb EMC, but I know Georgia Power folks, that their bills are way too high for what they should be, so I wanted to do my part and make sure that they’re getting their rights protected,” she said.
Retired IT project manager Cheryl Fairley. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Retired IT project manager Cheryl Fairley said she’s not sure what a Democratic win would mean for Cherokee residents like her.
“I don’t know, but it’s going to mean something to me because it’s going to mean that there’s two Democrats in there and not two Republicans,” she said.
“I’m a Democrat and I want the Democrats to take over,” she added. “I want Democrats everywhere because I’m tired of these Republicans and what they got going on right now.”
The five members on the commission right now are all Republicans. If Democrats are successful in flipping both seats Tuesday, it would leave Republicans with more narrow control of the panel.
Fairley said she hopes that good results for Alicia Johnsona nd Hubbard will portend a happy 2026 for Georgia Democrats.
“It will give us some good momentum going in because we need Ossoff,” she said. “We just need him because right now the Republicans have the House, they have the Senate, they have everything.”
But the Georgia GOP has been pushing hard for Echols and Fitz Johnson to keep their seats, bringing out big names like Gov. Brian Kemp and celebrating endorsements from popular party figures like Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene.

Airline pilot Bradley Heydt said he cast his ballot for the Republicans because they will strike the proper balance between people and businesses.
“I believe that our state needs somebody who represents the interests not only of the people, but also for business interests in terms of development and expanding energy in the state,” he said. “I usually do not vote for people who represent the interests of just lowering utility bills. There’s more than just lowering utility bills. It’s managing our energy and our infrastructure in the state, and we need people who are prepared to do that job.”

Others, like stay-at-home mom Arianne Campbell said they cast ballots for the Republican candidates largely out of ideological or party loyalty.
“I’m Republican, so I voted for that,” she said. “I’m not really for anybody. It’s just, I felt like that would be the best for us.”
Pete Kane, who is a podcaster and business coach, struck a similar tone.
“I don’t know them personally, but I think (Echols and Fitz Johnson) are more conservative than the

other candidates,” he said. “I lean more conservative than I do liberal.”
Kane said he’s not too worried about next year’s midterms and he thinks Republicans will keep control of the state if they do what the people want them to.
“As long as they do a good job, I want them to serve the people,” he said. “And if they do what they’re supposed to do, they’ll get elected. If they don’t, we’ll kick them out.”

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The fate of two Rhode Island hospitals lies more than 1,500 miles away in Dallas where Rhode Island regulators and private attorneys are spending Tuesday hammering out a deal to keep the facilities open. 
Talks began directly after a federal bankruptcy hearing on Prospect Medical Holding’s push to close Roger Williams Medical Center in Providence and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital in North Providence by the end of the year.
The L.A-based hospital chain operator filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January. Despite massive debt — Prospect owed between $1 billion and $10 billion to more than 100,000 creditors at the time of the bankruptcy filing — the sale of the two hospitals appeared on track.
Eight months later, the finish line remains elusive. 
“In all my years of doing Chapter 11, I’ve never seen one take this long,” said Chief Judge Stacey Jernigan, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. “I’ve never had this happen. That’s why I am asking things like ‘What the heck is going on?’”
Rhode Island officials, hospital workers and community members have wondered the same thing. 
The $80 million sale of the hospitals to The Centurion Foundation received approval from state regulators in June 2024. But Centurion remains unable to secure the $150 million in bond financing needed to close the deal, despite multiple revisions to the state-imposed conditions.
Hence, why Prospect is now seeking to close the hospitals by Dec. 31 or hand them over to the state of Rhode Island. The bankrupt company has spent $18 million to keep the hospitals afloat so far this year, with another $11 million in payroll and loan obligations through the end of the year, said Thomas Califano, an attorney with Sidley Austin LLP representing Prospect.
“With every chapter 11 bankruptcy, the longer you stay in, the more unanticipated things occur,” Califano said, adding that the hospital chain operator is now facing two wrongful death lawsuits since the sale to Centurion was approved. Califano did not offer more details on the lawsuits. 
In a rare moment of unity with Prospect, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha also spoke to the urgency of the sale during his first in-person appearance before the Dallas bankruptcy court on Tuesday.
“It’s either put up or shut up for Centurion,” Neronha said. 










It’s either put up or shut up for Centurion. 


– Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha


Until now, Neronha has remained bullish on Centurion as the best — and only — chance to save the hospitals from certain closure. 
But that stalwart backing has weakened.
‘“If Centurion can close the deal, that’s the deal we approved,” Neronha said. “If they can’t, let us know. We will engage with the debtor to figure out a path forward.”
Who is waiting in the wings?
His change in attitude reflects the possibility, publicly acknowledged for the first time on Monday, of an alternative buyer. 
In a preliminary statement to the bankruptcy court Andrew Troop, a New York bankruptcy attorney hired by Neronha’s office, mentioned an unidentified operator that “recently commenced diligence” on buying the hospitals.
Neronha’s office declined to comment when asked for details Tuesday. However, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi identified Prime Healthcare as the new party, the Boston Globe Rhode Island reported Tuesday. A spokesperson for Prime, a California for-profit that owns 51 hospitals, including Landmark Medical Center in Woonsocket, acknowledged but did not immediately answer requests for comment on Tuesday. 
Otis Brown, a spokesperson for The Centurion Foundation, also did not respond to immediate requests for comment.
Christopher Callaci, general counsel for the United Nurses and Allied Professionals, which represents more than 1,200 union workers at the pair of hospitals, remained skeptical of the potential for a new buyer.
“Due diligence does not mean they are going to make an offer,” Callaci said in an interview Tuesday. “The Centurion deal, with all its blemishes, is what we’ve got right now.”
The union was initially skeptical of Centurion due to its lack of experience running hospitals. But like Neronha, its members put aside their reservations when it became clear that the Atlanta nonprofit was the best option to prevent the hospitals from closing.
Prospect’s recent signal of intent to shutter the facilities by the end of the year has reignited calls for action from health care leaders and state officials, warning of severe consequences across the state.
The two hospitals offer 500 beds between them, including 104 beds for behavioral health patients, equal to more than 20% of behavioral health beds. They accounted for more 50,000 emergency room visits in 2024 and Roger Williams houses the only fully accredited bone marrow transplant unit in the state.
“The Society urges state leaders to ensure that Rhode Island’s hospitals remain stable, supported, and able to serve their communities over the long term,” Dr. Dina Himelfarb, president of the Rhode Island Medical Society, said in a statement Tuesday. “The potential loss of either facility would have profound consequences for patients, physicians, and the entire healthcare system.”
Gov. Dan McKee’s office also reiterated its commitment to keeping the hospitals open in a separate statement Tuesday, including working on contingency plans with state health care agencies to “protect patient care should all other viable options not materialize.”
Avoiding catastrophe 
Neither Neronha nor Troop addressed the prospect of state ownership in written or oral comments to the court, instead focusing their arguments on the dangers of closure, which Troop called “catastrophic.”
Ceasing operations could lead to a mass exodus among the 2,400 employees, including critical nurses and physicians, according to written court testimony from court filings from Suzanne Koenig, the court-appointed patient care ombudsman. Koenig and her team visited the Rhode Island hospitals on Oct. 27 and 28 to talk with patients and staff and observe operations.
“We’re really pleased with the care in the facilities,” Koenig told Jernigan Tuesday. “It’s impressive, and the staff are impressive.”
But, she continued, “the silence is deafening for them. They just need to move forward, and the absence of not moving forward is what’s causing anxiety.” 
A potential competitor has not deterred Centurion, which remains committed to buying Roger Williams and Fatima despite the lack of financial benefits, David Wender, an attorney representing the nonprofit, said during the court hearing Tuesday.
“I don’t get it, I don’t know why they’ve devoted this much time,” Wender said of his client. “The amount of energy and time and money and effort that’s been put into this has been exhaustive.”
Wender touted Centurion’s mission-driven inspiration to save the struggling health care facilities, which have faced years of operational and financial problems under Prospect’s ownership. He blamed Prospect for the challenges in finding bond investors, now made harder because of Prospect’s move to close the facilities.
“No rational investor will provide financing for a hospital acquisition when the seller is simultaneously seeking court authorization to transfer the hospitals to the State or close them entirely,” Wender wrote in a Monday filing to the court. “The Debtors’ breach does not merely threaten the financing — it may well make that financing impossible.”










No rational investor will provide financing for a hospital acquisition when the seller is simultaneously seeking court authorization to transfer the hospitals to the State or close them entirely.


– David Wender, an attorney for The Centurion Foundation 


But the nonprofit buyer may not need investors after all. A bridge loan from Bank of America, which was recently tapped as co-manager to underwrite the bonds, could allow Centurion to bypass the bond market for now, Wender said Tuesday.
The short-term financing could let Centurion close the sale by early or mid-December, according to court filings.
Details on the loan, including the interest and amount, were not immediately available.
Bank of America did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Tuesday.
While Wender pointed to the bridge loan as another example of Centurion’s commitment to creative ways to complete the purchase, Jernigan appeared skeptical. 
She compared the efforts by Centurion to attempts to find new buyers for a pair of Prospect-owned hospitals in Pennsylvania. The facilities closed shortly after the company filed for bankruptcy.
“I’m not sure,” she said, “As much as I was keeping hope alive, during the Pennsylvania situation I was hearing things like ‘we’re hopeful.’” 
But the promise of post-hearing negotiations at the Dallas offices for Prospect’s attorneys offered Jernigan some assurance that there was still a path forward.
“I don’t know who has a flight when, but I hope people brought their toothbrushes,” she said.

One sticking point: For some states, this month’s benefits could take months to arrive.
Meanwhile, a group of progressive Nebraska state lawmakers is still pursuing a special emergency legislative session to “protect Nebraska families” from any suspension of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and to give the state financial flexibility to meet “urgent” needs.
“We have to be prepared to step in,” said State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, who led the call by 15 state senators, 14 Democrats and one progressive nonpartisan, to convene an off-season session Nov. 12.

The group delivered a letter late Friday to Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen to begin the process. Buy-in is required from 33 of 49 lawmakers to consider the emergency session that would explore legislation to preserve programs such as SNAP and Nebraska’s Head Start. 
Cavanaugh called the proposed session a proactive step and option that could be canceled if the federal shutdown ends. In Nebraska, about 150,000 low-income and eligible participants, including children, participate in SNAP, formerly known as food stamps. The public grocery benefits amount to about $30 million each month, she said.
Shutdown, day 35 
Federally funded SNAP has been in a state of uncertainty as the government shutdown drags on since Oct. 1, when Congress failed to appropriate money for federal programs or pass a stopgap spending bill.
Leading into November, the Trump administration had warned it could not pay SNAP benefits for this month, saying it was legally prohibited from using a contingency fund it said was for emergencies and natural disasters. 
Two federal judges on Oct 31 ruled otherwise. One judge in a written order Saturday, Nov. 1, said there is “no question” that the contingency fund (which currently contains about $4.65 billion) must be used to provide the public food benefits. Monthly SNAP benefits for about 42 million Americans, nearly 40% of them children, reportedly cost more than $8 billion a month.
Trump administration to pay about half of November SNAP benefits amid shutdown

U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. of Rhode Island offered the Trump administration a choice: pay for a full month of benefits by tapping other reserve sources such as the child nutrition program by the end of Monday, or pay for partial benefits by the end of Wednesday through the contingency fund.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture opted to use the contingency fund. A USDA official pointed out that calculating half-month amounts would involve delay, and said in some states the changes and delivery will take anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months. The department believed it was complying with the judge’s order by starting the process of resuming payments Monday, according to a States Newsroom report reviewing a status report signed by Justice Department officials. The department did not address what might happen beyond November. 
‘Not the solution’
News that part of November’s benefits will come to Nebraskans “is a little help — but not the solution,” said Stephanie Sullivan, a spokesperson for the Food Bank for the Heartland, which has about 500 network partners in 93 counties of Nebraska and Iowa.

She said the organization was seeking clarification on what partial payment means, and on when Nebraskans should expect to see the grocery benefits loaded onto debit-like cards used by the state’s SNAP recipients to buy food at retailers. 
 “All those answers are still up in the air,” she said, urging an end to the shutdown.
Nebraska Appleseed, a statewide advocacy organization that has been monitoring SNAP and other program changes, also is awaiting details from the state on how recent developments will impact Nebraskans, said Eric Savaiano, Appleseed’s food and nutrition access manager.
Sullivan said there was no way that food bank partners could make up for the loss of SNAP benefits. For every meal the food bank provides, she said, SNAP provides nine.
“Food banks are meant to supplement,” said Sullivan.
Asked when Nebraskans could expect November benefits, a spokesman for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services told the Nebraska Examiner the state was awaiting guidance from USDA.

“Once received, the department will work as quickly as possible to distribute funds to Nebraska families,” Jeff Powell said Monday in a statement for both DHHS and the Governor’s Office. 
The state DHHS web site on Tuesday still displayed an earlier quote by Pillen, which has spawned a lawsuit, blaming Democrats in the U.S Senate for a government shutdown and for SNAP benefits being “unavailable in November.” 
Community responds
Despite the uncertainty, advocates who are stepping in to help fill gaps said they have been inspired by the response from Nebraskans.
“It’s been an overwhelming response,” said Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr., whose office launched and organized a citywide food drive. “We are going to continue to go forward until the people of this country are able to get their full SNAP benefits. We believe this is a humanitarian issue not a political issue.”

Omaha’s effort to collect nonperishables began last Wednesday and by Friday morning, several community centers acting as drop off points had run short of room. Staffers from the Mayor’s Office transported 5,500 pounds of nonperishable items that day from four centers to the food bank, which will distribute the goods. Monday yielded another nearly 12,000 pounds from five other centers, said Ewing.
The City of Omaha plans to allocate $45,000 more in keno revenue to the food bank. The Douglas County Board today approved allocation of $200,000 among eight eight nonprofit and community partners to strengthen food assistance efforts. 
The City of Lincoln has reminded residents of free lunches for youths at its F Street Community Center and of expanded food service starting Wednesday at an Aging Partners program at Victory Park. Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird was scheduled to speak Tuesday afternoon at the Food Bank of Lincoln to discuss other support of those affected by the SNAP pause. 
CHI Health made a $100,000 donation for Nebraska food banks. United Way of the Midlands and Omaha Community Foundation have launched fundraisers too.











It’s been an overwhelming response ... We believe this is a humanitarian issue not a political issue.

Sullivan said retailers, manufacturers and businesses have started various outreach efforts to increase donations and volunteers. Some restaurants are offering free meals. She said all donated food has to be sorted for distribution, and that she has been both amazed and inspired at the outpouring of help over the last week.
Diminished SNAP benefits come at a time when demand already was up for pantry food, she said, and that is exacerbated by federal workers without a paycheck. On top of that, the coming holiday season is the busiest for food bank partners, and concern mounts as the shutdown continues.
“It’s heartbreaking, it’s maddening as we approach the holiday season,” Sullivan said, to think that families might not be able to assemble a holiday meal.



Seeking special legislative session
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha said she is speaking also to Republican lawmakers to urge support for a special legislative session, and believes some  agree.

(Matthew Perschall/Louisiana Illuminator)The LSU Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to name McNeese State leader Wade Rousse its next system president, and it has picked the University of Alabama Provost Jim Dalton as both chancellor and provost of its Baton Rouge campus. 
The dual hires mark the first time the university will have separate system and main campus leaders since the roles were merged in 2012. 
Rousse has been in charge at McNeese, a small regional university in Lake Charles, since last year. He previously held other administrative jobs at the school since 2019.
The Lake Charles native earned his undergraduate degree from McNeese, an MBA from the University of New Orleans and his doctorate in economics from the University of Illinois Chicago.
Rousse was favored for the LSU presidency by board Vice Chairman Lee Mallett, also a Lake Charles native and a major political donor to Gov. Jeff Landry. 
One of Rousse’s key tasks as president will be to win the support of the faculty, some of whom have expressed skepticism throughout the search process because he lacks several of the key qualifications the presidential search committee established for presidential applicants. 
Unlike LSU, where total enrollment tops 42,000, McNeese ,with about 6,500 students, does not hold any research designation. In 2023, the most recent year data is available from the National Science Foundation, which tracks research spending, McNeese spent less than $500,000 on research, while LSU spent nearly $400 million. 
Rousse also did not ascend to his administrative rank though the traditional academic promotion path. He also hasn’t published a significant amount of research. In his first interview, Rousse questioned LSU’s research aspirations, but walked back his initial skepticism in his campus visit Monday. 
Throughout his public interviews, Rousse noted that he does have some research and teaching experience and argued his non-traditional background could be a boon to LSU. 
Dalton has been Alabama’s provost, the highest academic administrative role on campus, since 2020. His background is in pharmacy and developing prescription drugs. He worked at Michigan, Ohio State and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. He received a bachelor of science from the University of Cincinnati and his Ph.D. in pharmacology from Ohio State University.
LSU should become a student-centric university, with smaller class sizes, Dalton said during his interviews. One of his priorities would be to improve LSU’s retention rate for students after two years.
Dalton leaves Alabama as a defendant in a First Amendment lawsuit from a former instructor who was fired over comments she made following far-right activist Charlie Kirk’s shooting death. Candice Hale, the instructor, earned her Ph.D. from LSU.
It’s unclear which of the two men will reside in the president’s house. Before the positions were merged, the University House, as it’s known, was typically for the chancellor. 
The hirings mark the end of a dramatic search that began in August to little fanfare. But at a presidential search committee meeting on Oct. 1, seven LSU students were arrested after they were ordered out of the room for exceeding their allotted time for public comment.  
Search committee members were later required to sign non-disclosure agreements in order to maintain their positions on the committee. The NDAs prohibited them from discussing the committee’s work with the public or reporters, a practice which could violate their free speech rights, a First Amendment attorney said. The committee later required semifinalists for the president’s job to make their names public. 
Once three finalists were selected last Wednesday, LSU held a series of public forums over the next three business days for the candidates to interact with students, faculty and staff. Attendance was sparse at the forums, with no advance notice being provided on campus  about who the finalists were or when each candidate would meet with the public.
LSU’s presidency has been filled on an interim basis by Matt Lee, its vice president for agriculture, since June after William Tate left the university to take the same job at Rutgers University in New Jersey. It was anticipated Lee would receive a spot among the three finalists, but he was left off the list in what some faculty saw as a snub of their input. 
Also among Rousse’s first tasks is to fill the many upper-level vacancies at the university. 
LSU has interim officeholders at provost, chief financial officer, chancellor of its Shreveport medical school, vice president for enrollment management and multiple deans. There is also no one in charge of data and strategic analysis at the university. 
LSU is also searching for a new athletics director and football coach after Landry intervened in both of their firings. 
Rousse is expected to play an active role in finding the next coach and athletics director.

In the course of construction work in 2013, the remains of 36 individuals of African descent were uncovered in the heart of downtown Charleston. They had lain hidden for some 200 years in an unmarked 18th-century burial ground.
For more than two centuries, such burial grounds, especially those in the former American slave states, have often been erased or obscured — paved over by parking lots, built upon by highways or private development, or simply left unknown and untended.
In recent years, descendant communities in places such as Bethesda, Maryland; Richmond, Virginia; St. Petersburg, Florida; and Sugarland, Texas, have called for greater recognition and respect for these long-neglected sites.
As a public archaeologist and educator who has spent over a decade working in Charleston, I co-direct the Anson Street African Burial Ground project — the community-led effort to honor and respectfully lay to rest the 36 African ancestors whose remains were uncovered in 2013.
This Charleston project reflects a growing recognition of African American burial grounds as important historical memory sites and unique sources of genealogical information.
Yet there is still limited public understanding about how engaging with these places of sacred rest can promote collective healing, reconciliation and cross-cultural understanding.
Cemeteries obscured by history
Since the British colonial period, racist laws and customs across America prevented enslaved and free people of African descent from using white burial grounds to bury their dead.
On plantations, enslavers controlled where and how the enslaved were buried and whether burials could be marked or visited. In cities from Charleston to New York, segregated burial grounds, many now forgotten, were established by local authorities for indigent Black and white people.
Pushed to the margins, people of African descent maintained burial traditions and used impermanent or specific grave markers such as shells, bottles, clocks or ceramics — items that were culturally meaningful but often invisible or unimportant to white observers.
As a result, many of these sites were neither recorded in historical documents nor officially recognized as burial grounds.
From the 1770s, African American churches, benevolent societies and funeral homes sought to establish cemeteries where Black communities could honor the dead with dignity. What began regionally — especially in Charleston and Philadelphia — quickly spread nationally during the 19th century across the American South and North.
In the decades after Reconstruction, and especially during the Jim Crow era, nearly 6 million African Americans moved north and west to escape racial violence and seek better opportunities — an event known as the Great Migration.
This movement often severed ties between families and ancestral burial grounds in the South. As churches and burial societies lost members, many cemeteries fell into disrepair and were officially labeled “abandoned” by local authorities or developers.
In both rural and urban areas, Black burial grounds were often located on less valuable lands, sites that today are increasingly threatened by gentrification, development and the effects of climate change.
The Gullah Geechee, who descend from enslaved Africans from West Africa and still preserve unique cultural traditions in the southeastern U.S., argue these burial sites were never abandoned and that ancestors are still present.
This perspective views the dead as actively connected to the living. For them, lacking formally designated cemetery space doesn’t make the sites any less sacred.
A tradition of sacred spaces
For many African Americans, especially in the South, death during slavery was seen as not merely an ending but a spiritual return — a “homegoing.”
Rooted in West African spiritual worldviews and carried through other traditions in America, the act of burial was often viewed as a release from bondage, a return to the ancestors and a step toward wholeness.
The Gullah Geechee traditions of coastal South Carolina emphasize ancestral presence, spiritual continuity and the sanctity of the land. In that worldview, with a porous boundary between the living and the dead, proper burial and remembrance are not only cultural imperatives but necessary for community well-being.
It was not until the early 1990s that recognition of rights over ancestral remains and sacred burial grounds began to find a wider audience.
Inspired by the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act that recognized Indigenous rights over ancestral remains, African American communities increasingly asserted their own rights to ethical research, respectful handling and meaningful memorialization, especially during the 1991 New York African Burial Ground project, which reshaped public memory and archaeological ethics.
Discovered during construction in lower Manhattan, the 18th-century burial ground contained the remains of more than 400 enslaved and free Africans. Community advocacy led to the site’s protection, descendant-led research, ceremonial reburial and the establishment of a national memorial in 2006.
Since this time, across the U.S. and the Atlantic world, descendant-led ceremonies from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to Key West, Florida, have restored dignity to ancestral remains.
Meanwhile, efforts to preserve African American burial grounds, including by national scholar organizations and federal lawmakers, continue amid political debates over how history should be remembered and taught.
What made the Anson Street project unique
In Charleston, the Anson Street African Burial Ground project stands out for the way Gullah Geechee traditions and descendant collaboration shaped every stage of the process — from scientific study to reinterment.

Launched as a community-led initiative in 2017, the team began by listening.
Through regular gatherings, they invited questions about the ancestors’ lives and identities, and about their hopes for the reburial, centering Black community voices at every stage.
The team combined scientific investigations of ancestry and health while also creating space for spiritual guidance, ceremony and descendant leadership. In doing so, the project became more than a study of the past; it became a communal act of repair and remembrance, reconnecting Charleston’s present communities with the ancestors whose stories had long been buried.
Over the next two years, the team wove this commitment into every aspect of its work: youth art programs, a college course on memorial design, public exhibitions, and school partnerships. One of the most moving moments came from conversations with schoolchildren, who decided that the ancestors should be given names before they were reburied.
That naming ceremony took place in April 2019.
The names were conferred by Natalie Washington-Weik, a Yorùbá-Orisa Ọ̀ṣun priestess, a spiritual leader in a West African tradition and an African historian. She described the ritual as an “important step forward in reclaiming the humanity of the deceased people who were most likely forced to travel across the Atlantic Ocean under the terror of other humans – who saw them merely as animals.”
The ancestors were finally reinterred in a powerful public ceremony that reflected their ancestries and West-Central African spiritual traditions.
When pain is acknowledged, healing can occur
The 2019 naming and reinterment ceremonies were not simply commemorations; they were rituals of remembrance and healing.
Construction for a permanent memorial at the Anson Street site, designed by artist Stephen L. Hayes Jr., has now begun.
At its center is a basin fabricated with sacred soil collected from 36 African-descended burial grounds across the Charleston region. From the basin, 36 bronze hands will rise — cast from living community members whose profiles reflect those of the ancestors. Raised in gestures of prayer, resistance and reverence, these hands link past to present.
Throughout the memorialization process, community members reflected on what it meant to participate in such a project. Many spoke of feeling pride, reverence, joy, sadness and peace.
“This conversation makes me feel complete,” one participant said.
As Charleston demonstrates, these projects are not only about preserving the past — they are acts of recognition, respect and reconciliation, helping communities nationwide confront and honor the histories long denied to African-descended peoples.

,DC,2025-11-04 18:48:19+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,A defiant Trump vows no SNAP payments until Democrats cave on shutdown,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/defiant-trump-vows-no-snap-payments-until-democrats-cave-shutdown,,"President Donald Trump backtracked Tuesday on a pledge by his administration in court filings to partially fund November food assistance during the government shutdown, posting on social media that benefits “will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said later Tuesday that Trump was referring to future uses of a food assistance contingency fund and that the administration was complying with the court order, though that description did not match Trump’s post.It was not immediately clear what effect Trump’s declaration that he would refuse to provide food aid would have on benefits that usually are provided to some 42 million Americans and, at the moment, are shut off pending the partial payments.At the same time, a coalition of cities and nonprofits suing the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the delayed partial payments were not enough.The coalition that filed suit, led by the Rhode Island State Council of Churches, just prior to Trump’s social media post Tuesday asked a Rhode Island federal court to compel the government to pay full benefits. The USDA’s promise Monday that it would provide partial payments to households who use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from a roughly $4.5 billion contingency fund, was an insufficient response to a court order, the groups said.USDA officials said Monday they could not complete partial payments for November benefits by Chief District Court Judge John J. McConnell Jr.’s deadline of Wednesday, and warned it could take several months for beneficiaries to receive the funding because of the administrative difficulties of recalculating and processing partial benefits.The groups suing said Tuesday that if paying partial benefits created such delays, McConnell should force the government to pay full benefits instead.“If Defendants cannot comply with the Court’s command to expeditiously resolve the hurdles to making ‘timely’ partial payments, then that is a problem of their own making,” the groups wrote. “They chose—unlawfully and contrary to past agency precedent and guidance—to withhold all funding for SNAP,” they continued. “That this unlawful decision may have made it impossible for them to clear the administrative hurdles now is no excuse. They still have a straightforward path to meeting the directives in the Court’s order.”The department could legally and relatively easily tap into a separate child nutrition program account that holds $23 billion, the groups said. That would more than cover the $9 billion needed for a month of SNAP benefits, they said. McConnell ordered the government to respond to the challengers’ motion, and set a hearing on the issue for Thursday afternoon. Trump changes courseWithin an hour of the groups’ filing, Trump, who had said he was eager to restore SNAP benefits, responded on social media with his defiant message that he would only release any SNAP funding once Democrats in Congress agreed to end the government shutdown that began Oct. 1.Trump had said Friday he told government lawyers to seek clarification on how the government could legally send out benefits during the shutdown, adding he did not want Americans to go hungry.“If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding,” he wrote Oct. 31, following an oral order by McConnell.McConnell issued a written order the next day that benefits be provided either in full by Monday or partially by Wednesday. The USDA responded Monday that it would provide partial benefits from the contingency fund that held about half of a month’s worth of benefits, but that the process could take weeks or even months for states to recalibrate the amount each beneficiary would receive and to process those payments.Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins echoed that commitment just before the challengers submitted their motion to compel full payments.“This morning, @USDA sent SNAP guidance to States,” Rollins wrote on X. “My team stands by to offer immediate technical assistance. This will be a cumbersome process, including revised eligibility systems, State notification procedures, and ultimately, delayed benefits for weeks, but we will help States navigate those challenges.”Spokespeople for the USDA did not return messages seeking an explanation for the course change Tuesday morning.At the White House press briefing Tuesday afternoon, Leavitt said she had “just spoken” with Trump and sought to clarify his statement.“We are digging into a contingency fund,” she said. “The president doesn't want to tap into this fund in the future and that’s what he was referring to.” Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of Democracy Forward, an advocacy group representing the groups challenging the administration, said in a Tuesday post to social media that Trump’s post was “immoral” and that the group would make use of it.“See you in court,” Perryman said.Shutdown lingersThe dispute over SNAP benefits stems from the lapse in government funding that began when Congress failed to appropriate money for federal programs by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1.The USDA said in a plan published just ahead of the shutdown — and since deleted — that it would use the contingency fund, which then held $6 billion, to cover SNAP benefits if needed.But the department reversed itself within weeks, telling states in an Oct. 10 letter that benefits would not be paid in November if the government remained shut down on the first of the month.Members of each party have blamed the other for the lack of SNAP benefits. Democrats have demanded the administration reshuffle funds to cover the program, as it has with other federal funding during the shutdown, while Republicans have called on Democrats to approve a stopgap spending bill to reopen the government at fiscal 2025 spending levels.Democrats in Congress have blocked Republicans’ “clean” continuing resolution to reopen the government in a bid to force negotiations on expiring tax credits for people who buy insurance on the Affordable Care Act marketplace.As of Tuesday, the parties showed little sign of softening their positions.Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report.",,,,2025-11-04 13:57:45.834599

Rachelle Smit (R-Shelbyville) presents to the House Election Integrity Committee on her bill to ban foreign money in ballot initiatives. Nov. 4, 2025. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. The Michigan House Election Integrity Committee debated three bills Tuesday related to foreign interference in state elections — in funding for ballot initiatives and election administration, and in the physical parts of election machines.
Testimony on both bills related to funding centered on the ability of foreign citizens to donate to 501(c)(4) organizations, nonprofits that are not required to disclose their donors — which can turn them into so-called “dark money” groups that donate to political activities without identifying where the money is coming from. 
In terms of ballot initiatives, State Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Shelbyville), who also chairs the committee, said that her bill, HB 5197, “would cancel foreign influence in our elections and ensure that only Michigan voices get to decide our state laws.”
Specifically, according to Caitlin Sutherland, the Executive Director of right-leaning watchdog group Americans for Public Trust, much of that influence in Michigan is coming from a group known as the Sixteen Thirty Fund, a left-leaning 501(c)(4) organization that donated nearly $24 million nationally to campaigns in 2024 to Democratic candidates and PACs. One of Sixteen Thirty Fund’s biggest donors, Sutherland noted, is Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss.

“No other state has seen a greater influx of Sixteen Thirty Fund’s foreign backed money than your state,” Sutherland, also a former research director for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said. “Over many years, Sixteen Thirty Fund has spent almost $34 million in Michigan year after year in initiative after initiative. The Sixteen Thirty Fund is consistently the number one donor, from over 11 million spent against protecting life to over 20 million to radically change your state’s election laws to over 2 million to mandate paid sick leave and everything in between.”
“Decisions as significant as amending the constitution of this state belong exclusively in the hands of the citizens of our country and the voters of Michigan,” said Jason Snead, the executive director of the Honest Elections Project, a right-wing group affiliated with Project 2025 that advocates for stricter election laws. “Foreign nationals have no business influencing ballot measure campaigns, and those campaigns should not be allowed to serve as a Trojan horse for foreign interference into the democratic process.”
State Rep. William Bruck (R-Erie) put forth the second bill in the package, HB 5198, which would place similar restrictions on foreign funding specifically earmarked for the administration of elections. 
Asked if this was actively happening in Michigan, Bruck noted, “There is not a prohibition, so I’m assuming that it has happened.”
“It sounds like we’re battling with evil in this process, something that is trying to short circuit a good process we’ve had in our country for years,” said Rep. Joseph Fox (R-Fremont). 
Issues with 501(c)(4) funds involving Michigan ballot committees are not limited to progressive causes, as evidenced by the charges brought last year in the Unlock Michigan dark money scandal. In that instance, organizers sought a ballot initiative to repeal 1945 Emergency Power rules that Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer used to try and curb the spread of COVID-19 in 2020. 
While no foreign donors were publicly implicated in that case, the shielding of the donors’ identities remained an issue. The rules themselves were later determined to be unconstitutional making a ballot initiative unnecessary. 
Smit’s other bill, HB 4720, would prevent any voting equipment in the state from including parts made by companies on a Federal Communications Commission list of potential security risks for communication. 
Rep. Stephen Wooden (D-Grand Rapids) expressed caution that, if this list were to change shortly before an election, “then we’re thrown into a degree of chaos.” That could require clerks to hand-count ballots, which Wooden noted can have a higher margin of error than machine-counted votes. 
However, Smit responded, “I would argue that if there was a country of concern or something that was added to this list, that would be far more concerning than actually having to hand count the ballots at the jurisdiction.”
The committee did not take votes on any of the bills in the package at Tuesday’s hearing.

Laura Kelly and GOP House Speaker Dan Hawkins continue a dispute about rise and fall of Kansas tax revenue on the state government's budget.,"Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, offer contrasting perspectives on implications of an October surge in Kansas state government sales and individual income tax collections amid a crash in corporate income tax receipts. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly said overall state tax collections in October exceeded the monthly estimate despite a sharp drop in corporate income tax revenue that ought to serve as a warning to lawmakers assembling budget plans ahead of the 2026 session.
The state took in $695 million during October, which was 7.2% or $47 million above the level projected by state economists and budget analysts. The monthly total was 4.1% greater than October 2024.
The monthly report from the Kansas Department of Revenue showed state sales tax and individual income tax payments outperformed prognostications issued in April.
The state’s individual income tax revenue totaled $367.4 million in October. That was $67 million, or 22.5%, above the official projection. Kansas took in 17.9% more in individual income taxes this October compared to one year ago.
The state’s share of retail sales tax receipts in Kansas hit $289.5 million in October, which was 1.2% or $3.5 million above the anticipated mark. That constituted a decline of 1.7% from October 2024.
Meanwhile, the state received $15.9 million in corporate income tax last month. That was $24.1 million or 60% below the target.
“While this month’s tax collections indicate some good news, corporate income tax collections have significantly missed the mark, which is concerning,” Kelly said. “My administration will continue to monitor revenues and prioritize fiscal responsibility as I craft my fiscal year 2027 budget proposal.”
On Nov. 13, the state’s revenue estimators scheduled a meeting to update the Kansas revenue forecast. Those numbers would be available to the Democratic governor and Republican-led Legislature as they worked on separate budget bills for the fiscal year starting July 1, 2026.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Republican running for state insurance commissioner, said the October revenue report illustrated effectiveness of work by the Republican majority in the Legislature to tweak the state budget and offer tax relief. In a statement, Hawkins made a connection between growth in state tax revenue and the GOP’s handling of the state’s financial affairs.
“Legislative Republicans have been laser-focused on putting money back in the pockets of Kansans,” Hawkins said. “In just the first three months of the fiscal year, total state receipts are up more than $100 million.”
Hawkins said Republicans in Kansas “remain committed to showing the results that can be achieved with level-headed and carefully crafted policy” instead of “grandstanding” by Kelly and other Democrats.
For several years, Kelly expressed concern that Hawkins and Senate President Ty Masterson were leading the Legislature toward a financial cliff. She said the Legislature’s revenue and expenditure adjustments produced a state budget that would spend $300 million to $700 million more than the state collected in taxes. The result, she said, was erosion of the state’s cash reserve of about $3 billion.
Kelly, who is nearing completion of her second term and leaves office in January 2027, said the budget “put together last year by the Legislature is not sustainable over time.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/photograph-of-cash-100-scaled-e1737161254865-1024x720.jpg,,,2025-11-04 13:57:45.834599

Reporting Highlights

Caught in a Wholesale Sweep: Trump’s Memphis Safe Task Force promised to focus on violent criminals, but after being stopped for no apparent reason, some Memphians say they don’t feel safe.
Pretextual Stops Return: Last year, the DOJ criticized Memphis police for using minor infractions as a pretext to search people for serious crimes. Under Trump’s crackdown, it’s happening again.
Intimidation and Harassment: A month of Trump’s police task force operations in Memphis yielded over 1,700 arrests — and resident concerns that they are being racially profiled and harassed.


When Reggie Williams turned 18 two decades ago, his mother entrusted him with his birth certificate. Keep it on you at all times, she advised, in case you encounter police.
On a recent afternoon, he had a copy in his wallet, along with his state ID, as he walked from his uptown apartment in Memphis, Tennessee, to a nearby corner store.
A Memphis Police Department cruiser pulled up, and two officers questioned him: Where was he coming from? Where was he going?
Williams responded, and the interrogation continued: Did he have any weapons on him? No. Any drugs? No. When asked to empty his pockets, the 39-year-old artist turned over his wallet and phone.
Minutes later, four men poured out of an unmarked SUV with tinted windows. They carried rifles and wore body armor — but no identifying badges.
He thought of his family. “Deep down, I felt like I was not gonna make it home,” said Williams, who is Black.
The Oct. 15 incident occurred about two weeks after the National Guard and 30 other local, state and federal agencies descended upon Memphis as part of President Donald Trump’s order authorizing “hypervigilant policing” to end violent crime. In addition to targeting violent criminals, the operation dubbed “Memphis Safe Task Force” has ensnared innocent residents of this majority-Black city.
Among those who have reported being harassed: a ride-share driver stopped for not wearing a seat belt despite having one on as she drove a passenger to the airport; a pastor pulled over for looking lost as she left a church gathering; and, in a case of mistaken identity, a 72-year-old man roused from bed and marched out of his apartment while clad in only his robe and underwear.
None of these people were ultimately ticketed or arrested. But they told MLK50: Justice Through Journalism and ProPublica that they feared for their safety during what they described as indiscriminate and intimidating police encounters. While none of the law enforcement agencies involved responded to specific questions about these residents’ experiences, the news organizations corroborated their accounts using contemporaneous text messages and social media posts, as well as interviews with neighbors and relatives.
“I really believe that if I didn’t have that birth certificate, I would be somewhere in a facility,” said Williams, recalling one of the armed federal agents approaching him aggressively to ask if he was from Ethiopia or Ghana. “If you’re not white, we’re just all going to be targeted.”
When the Memphis police returned Williams’ wallet, the officer cautioned him: Don’t do anything bad and keep your ID on you. That warning, said Williams, who posted about the stop on Facebook, echoes a slavery-era requirement that free African Americans carry “freedom papers,” official court documents to prove they weren’t enslaved lest they be returned to bondage by slave patrols or law enforcement.
The U.S. Marshals Service, which leads the task force, did not respond to specific questions about Williams’ experience but disputed accounts of Black residents being harassed.
“The suggestion that our federal law enforcement officers are racially profiling citizens is not founded in reality and undermines the credibility and safety of the Task Force Officers who should be commended for the exceptional work they are doing to keep this community safe!” Ryan Guay, a spokesperson for the U.S. Marshals Service, said in a written statement.
“The Memphis Safe Task Force remains focused on its mission to make Memphis safer by removing violent offenders from our streets,” he said.
The Memphis Police Department did not respond to requests for comment about Williams’ encounter.
The U.S. Marshals Service told MLK50 and ProPublica that the task force does not track the number of stops law enforcement agencies have made since they surged into the city or how many of those stops resulted in citations or arrests. Nor does it track the racial demographics of the people stopped or arrested, a spokesperson said.
With spotty data, the task force’s operations remain opaque, making it difficult to capture a complete picture of its work. MLK50 obtained an Oct. 13 task force summary of its first two weeks of activity showing more than 1,500 personnel — just under half of whom are city and county law enforcement — on the ground, making 854 arrests and issuing 4,160 traffic citations. An MLK50 analysis of one day’s worth of arrest records obtained by the news organization found that nearly three quarters of the 51 people arrested Oct. 13 were not charged with a violent crime.
The task force said it has made 1,744 arrests as of Oct. 29, though it did not specify how many of those were related to violent crimes.

Democratic mayors and governors have vocally resisted Trump’s move to deploy the military against residents of Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, Oregon. In Memphis, Mayor Paul Young has said he opposes the deployment of the National Guard but has tried to cast the federal insurgence as an opportunity to strengthen the Memphis Police Department’s crime-fighting efforts. Memphis, which has a history of aggressive policing, reported a record high of 428 homicides in 2023, but crime overall had dipped to a 25-year-low earlier this year.
“Before the federal task force came to Memphis, we were already making strides to bring violent crime down,” Young, a Democrat, said in a statement. “We are pushing for the federal task force to remain focused on violent crime.”
Free the 901, a campaign supported by more than 20 community organizations, hosts weekly press conferences to share how the deployment is affecting residents and has joined protests to oppose the militarization of the city. At one demonstration, a Black Hawk helicopter circled overhead, reviving concerns that law enforcement was surveilling residents engaged in activities protected by the First Amendment.
Across the city, residents have reported a pattern: Tennessee Highway Patrol initiates a traffic stop, then federal agents roll in.
That’s what happened to Alandria London, a ride-share driver, as she was taking a passenger to the airport on Oct. 8. Wary of the heavy police presence in the area, she said she drove extra cautiously. A Tennessee Highway Patrol trooper on a motorcycle pulled her over anyway.
As soon as the officer approached the car he said, “Oh, I didn’t see your seat belt,” London recalled. He told her he needed to “call it in,” then let her go without asking for her driver’s license. She said a white van with “Immigration” written on the side pulled up behind the motorcycle; she suspected the officer had stopped her after mistaking her ethnicity.
“I do think that I was profiled. I think they were looking for someone of Hispanic descent,” said London, who is Black and posted about her experience on Facebook that afternoon along with a photo of herself wearing a seat belt. “After this incident, I could see why people should stay home, to stay out of the line of fire and move smart.”
Neither the Tennessee Highway Patrol nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded to questions about London’s experience.
Despite the task force’s stated focus on violent crime, a fifth of arrests made in the first two weeks were related to immigration, data obtained by MLK50 shows. Brady McCarron, a U.S. Marshals Service spokesperson, would not give an updated number of immigration-related arrests but responded in an email that “while all the work completed by the Task Force is very important, we remain focused on the violent crime within the City of Memphis.”
Community organizers say many Hispanic residents are changing their daily patterns for fear of being detained: Patients are skipping doctors’ appointments, and parents are keeping their children home from school. Prior to the task force, Vecindarios 901, an immigrant resource organization, typically logged about 15 calls and messages a day reporting law enforcement sightings to its hotline. The group says it now logs around 120 per day.
To prepare residents for the influx of police, community organizations shared on social media a list of best practices: Avoid making eye contact with law enforcement, don’t argue in public and steer clear of highly patrolled areas. Memphians appeared to heed the last warning, prompting the city’s tourism agency to encourage people to return to downtown restaurants, museums and other businesses.
Appearing in Memphis on Oct. 1 to launch the task force, U.S. homeland security adviser Stephen Miller told hundreds of law enforcement officers gathered before him that they were “unleashed.”
“The handcuffs that you’re carrying, they’re not on you anymore. They’re on the criminals,” Miller bellowed as he stood in an East Memphis warehouse, flanked by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. “Whatever you need to get it done, we’re gonna get it done.”
Miller’s comments alarmed many residents and community organizers, especially coming shortly after the last two Memphis police officers involved in the fatal beating of Tyré Nichols, an unarmed Black man, in a 2023 traffic stop were released on bail. (The men were acquitted on state charges related to the death but are still facing federal prosecution.) The former officers were part of a special unit focused on violent crime that was disbanded after Nichols’ death.
A subsequent U.S. Department of Justice investigation found that Memphis police have a pattern of escalating encounters involving low-level offenses, using unjustified force, and making unconstitutional stops and unlawful arrests. Memphis police treated Black residents more harshly than white ones engaged in similar conduct, the Justice Department said. Trump’s Department of Justice withdrew the report and closed the investigation, characterizing Biden-era scrutiny of civil rights violations by law enforcement as a “failed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments.”
After Nichols’ death, the Memphis City Council banned the police from stopping drivers for minor infractions like broken taillights to search for more serious violations, but Tennessee’s Republican-led legislature passed a bill last year that undid the city ordinance. Now, those same types of traffic stops, called pretextual stops, have become a major part of the task force’s activities in Memphis, according to MLK50 and ProPublica’s review of more than three dozen affidavits of people arrested as part of task force operations.
ELaura James Reid, pastor of Coleman Chapel CME Church, said she was pulled over by a man driving an unmarked SUV with a matte army green finish as she was leaving her denomination’s unity summit at an East Memphis hotel on Oct. 10. She’d seen a car like it in the hotel parking lot with a National Guard license plate on the back.
The man, wearing camouflage fatigues, approached James Reid’s window and told her he stopped her because she looked lost.
James Reid, 49 and a lifelong Memphian, had been to the hotel many times before, including for annual ecumenical meetings. When she informed the man she was not lost, he said she looked like she was “driving unsure.”
James Reid didn’t know what that meant. She’d stopped at the stop sign. And she’d signaled her left turn.
The man asked for her license, but James Reid, a former schoolteacher who is familiar with the National Guard’s role in natural disasters, said she had a question for him first: Was it normal for National Guard members to ask for residents’ licenses when they go to cities to help people? In response, she said, he told her to have a nice day and to be safe.
Kealy Moriarty, a spokesperson for the Tennessee National Guard, did not respond to specific questions about the incident, including  what “driving unsure” looks like, but said it is not conducting traffic stops. The military branch is “supporting the U.S. Marshals Service and multiple local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies as part of the Memphis Safe Task Force,” Moriarty said. “Tennessee Guardsmen and women are currently assisting with tasks such as community safety patrols, site security, and traffic control in support of ongoing efforts to reduce crime and promote public safety in Memphis.”
Residents interviewed for this article said it was at times unclear which agencies’ officers were stopping them. Across the city, reporters have witnessed officers patrolling without badges or uniforms that identify their agencies.
When law enforcement officers do not identify their agencies while making stops, residents can’t demand accountability, civil rights advocates say. “This is way more than a police operation,” said Josh Spickler, executive director of Just City, a local criminal justice reform organization. “This is a power grab and a rapid erosion of your civil liberties.”
James Reid, who spoke about the incident to members of her congregation, said her experience counters the task force’s stated mission of targeting violent crimes.
“I don’t feel safe,” said James Reid, who is Black. “It fits into the narrative of keeping us in our place. I don’t think it fits the narrative of stopping violent criminals, unless you driving down the street is considered violent.”
To lower crime for good, governments must invest in violence interruption programs, public education and access to mental health care — not just policing, said James Reid and several Democratic state legislators and local politicians.
Some Memphis residents living in high-crime neighborhoods said they welcome the increased policing to make their communities safer.
“It’s good they’re here. Traffic is a lot lighter, and hopefully things will get better,” said Ann Morris, a 61-year-old bartender. Morris, who is Black, said she hopes it will serve as a “wake-up call” to the young men in the city.

Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican who welcomed the federal intervention, has said that while “the surge will diminish at some point,” the task force’s operations and collaboration between organizations “will last forever.” Lee’s spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
“If they’re not a criminal element, then they shouldn’t be afraid,” Lee said at the Oct. 14 news conference.
But staying out of trouble does not protect residents from nerve-racking police encounters.
Just days after the task force was deployed to Memphis, Phillip Lewis was awakened by loud knocks and the doorbell. The 72-year-old yelled for whoever was at the door to hold on as he put a robe over his underwear and walked slowly across his South Memphis apartment. Cancer has taken the 6-foot-6-inch-tall former high school basketball standout from 185 pounds in his prime to 123 pounds.
“Are you Slim?” asked one of the two armed officers standing outside his second floor apartment, where Lewis’ full name is printed neatly below the doorbell.
The officer didn’t say which agency he was with, Lewis said, but his uniform said HSI — Homeland Security Investigations. (Security camera footage reviewed by MLK50 and ProPublica showed an officer identifying himself to the landlord as a U.S. marshal.)
“I thought they was ICE,” Lewis said.
One of the officers grabbed his arm, and the other told Lewis to walk down the stairs and sit on the bottom step. A third officer showed Lewis a photograph on his cellphone of a sex offender the officers were looking for. “I said, ‘That ain’t none of me.’”
They then asked Lewis for identification. “How I got ID and I’m in my drawers?” Lewis snapped.
They took him back to his apartment for his wallet, and an officer pulled out Lewis’ state ID. He was not the man they were looking for.
If officers had asked for his ID earlier, Lewis said, they would have recognized their mistake, and he would have been spared the indignity of being questioned by police in his nightclothes in front of his neighbors. MLK50 and ProPublica reviewed Lewis’ notes made after the Oct. 2 incident as well as text exchanges with his sister about the encounter, and interviewed his sister, a neighbor and his landlord.
The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Homeland Security Investigations, did not respond to questions about Lewis’ experience. Neither did the U.S. Marshals Service.
As the officers left without an apology, one offered a fist bump. But Lewis was angry. “I said, ‘Y’all done pissed me off with all this bull, and y’all don’t even know who you’re looking for!’”

The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
In an email, Denk said that he has experienced incarceration for a substance use issue and has had many friends who have had similar experiences. 
“One of my best friends was in prison with me,” Denk said. “It was his tenth time in prison — all for substance use issues. However, after he was released, this last time, he died from an overdose.”
Denk said he would like to see wrap-around services extended to include all prisoners. However, he supports a bipartisan effort in the Wisconsin Legislature to request a specific type of waiver of federal Medicaid law for a state demonstration project to provide eligible incarcerated people with up to 90 days of prerelease health care coverage. The coverage would include case management services, medication-assisted treatment for all types of substance use disorders and a 30-day supply of prescription medications to help people continue to overcome addictions after release. There are 19 other states that have approved waivers, while nine, including D.C., are pending. 
In 2023, the Biden administration put out guidance encouraging states to test strategies to support the re-entry of incarcerated people into communities, according to the health policy research organization KFF.
While Medicaid is prohibited from paying for non-inpatient services provided during incarceration, states can apply for a partial waiver of that policy.
A bill in the Wisconsin Legislature, AB 604, would require the Wisconsin Department of Health Services to request the waiver from the federal government. It will receive a hearing Tuesday afternoon in the Assembly Committee on Mental Health and Substance Abuse Prevention. Its senate counterpart, SB 598, has been referred to the Committee on Health.  
In a press release, Sen. Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi) said the bill would offer a way to reduce state and local health care costs for individuals with substance use disorders who are already eligible for Medicaid and are incarcerated in state prisons or county jails. She said it would also enhance access to care after release. 
“If we can initiate treatment for more individuals struggling with substance use disorders while they are incarcerated, we can both improve health outcomes once they are released back into their communities and lower rates of recidivism,” Keyeski said. 
Denk said that upon release, he had to search for a new provider, which “got more and more difficult to do.” He said that “case management would help with this issue — and reduce stressors that cause people to use substances.”
Support from lawmakers of both parties, activists 
Sen. Jesse James (R-Thorp) and Rep. Clint Moses (R-Menomonie) are among the bipartisan group of lawmakers who introduced or cosponsored AB 604.
James is the chair of the Senate Committee on Mental Health, Substance Abuse Prevention, and Children and Families, while Moses is chair of the Assembly Committee on Health, Aging and Long-Term Care. Sen. Howard Marklein, co-chair of the Joint Committee on Finance, is another cosponsor. 
“This bill is about saving lives and giving people coming out of the criminal justice system the best chance of recovery and reintegration into their communities,” James said in an emailed statement. 
The statement cited a North Carolina study of opioid overdose death rates between 2000 and 2015, which concluded that people released from prison are highly vulnerable to opioids and need urgent prevention measures. 
“When treatment begins pre-release and is maintained throughout reentry, we will see meaningful improvement in health outcomes,” James said.
Moses said in a statement that the bill will help give incarcerated individuals a positive start in a transitional phase in their lives, and would also reduce costs for local governments. 
The criminal justice reform advocacy groups EX-Incarcarated People Organizing (EXPO) and WISDOM expressed support for the legislation in statements to the Examiner. 
“For too long, people leaving incarceration have faced dangerous gaps in healthcare coverage — especially those living with substance use disorders,” EXPO stated. 
The legislation “recognizes what we see every day in our work,” according to the organization, “that people returning home are far more likely to succeed when their health and basic needs are supported from the start.”
In an email to the Examiner, Mark Rice of WISDOM said that many formerly and currently incarcerated people are struggling with poverty, mental illness and addiction. He said that “far too many people” detained in prisons and jails are needlessly dying and suffering due to health issues that could be fixed through increased access to care during and after incarceration.
“The system must be fundamentally transformed so that health is prioritized over punishment,” Rice said. 
Under the bill, the Department of Health Services would submit the request for a waiver by Jan. 1, 2027.

Free.,"Congress remains deadlocked, with government shutdown now on day 35","Ariana Figueroa, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-remains-deadlocked-government-shutdown-now-day-35,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate Tuesday failed for the 14th time to advance a stopgap spending bill to fund the government, as the ongoing shutdown hit 35 days and is now tied with the shutdown of 2018-2019 as the longest ever.The 54-44 vote was nearly identical to the previous 13 votes, as Republicans and Democrats remained unwilling to change positions. The legislation extending funding to Nov. 21 needed at least 60 votes to advance, per the Senate’s legislative filibuster. Even though the upper chamber has been unable to pass a stopgap spending measure for more than a month, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters Tuesday that he believes senators are “making progress.” He floated keeping the Senate in session next week. The chamber is scheduled to be in recess for the Veterans Day holiday. “We'll think through that as the week progresses, but I guess my hope would be we'll make some progress,” he said.Thune added that any stopgap spending bill will need to be extended past Nov. 21, “because we're almost up against the November deadline right now.”Duffy warns of flight ‘chaos’ due to staff shortagesTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned during a Tuesday press conference at the Department of Transportation that if the government shutdown continues into next week, it would lead to “chaos” and certain airspace would need to be closed due to a shortage of air traffic controllers who have continued to work amid the shutdown.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said at a separate press conference at the Capitol that he would bring the House back to vote on a stopgap spending measure if the Senate extends the funding date.

“If the Senate passes something, of course we'll come back,” Johnson said. “We're running out of (the) clock.”Johnson said he is “not a fan” of extending the bill to December and would prefer a January deadline. He said extending a stopgap funding bill “into January makes sense, but we got to, obviously, build consensus around that.” Senators at oddsOn Tuesday’s Senate vote, Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, both Democrats, and Maine independent Sen. Angus King voted with Republicans to advance the legislation. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul voted no.Senate Democrats have refused to support the House-passed GOP measure over concerns about the expiration of health care tax subsidies. As open enrollment begins, people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace are seeing a drastic spike in premium costs.

Republicans have maintained that any negotiations on health care must occur after Democrats agree to fund the government. The Trump administration has also tried to pressure Democrats to accept the House stopgap spending measure by instructing the U.S. Department of Agriculture to not tap into its contingency fund to provide critical food assistance to 42 million Americans. SNAP fightTwo federal courts have found the Trump administration acted unlawfully in holding back those benefits, and on Monday USDA announced it would partially release Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits. However, President Donald Trump Tuesday morning wrote on his social media platform that SNAP benefits would only be released when Democrats vote to reopen the government, a move that would likely violate the two court orders.“SNAP BENEFITS, which increased by Billions and Billions of Dollars (MANY FOLD!) during Crooked Joe Biden’s disastrous term in office (Due to the fact that they were haphazardly ‘handed’ to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need, which is the purpose of SNAP!), will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!,” he wrote.This report will be updated.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-11-04 13:02:34.067383

(Photo courtesy of House Republican Caucus)House Speaker Pro Tem Mike Karickhoff won’t seek reelection next year, becoming the first high-ranking member of the Legislature to make such a decision ahead of the 2026 elections.
Karickhoff, R-Kokomo, made the announcement in a statement released Monday in which he said “It has been the honor of a lifetime to serve the people of District 30 and the state of Indiana.”
Karickhoff was first elected to the House in 2010, representing parts of Howard and Grant counties, and first became speaker pro tem for the 2019 session.
In that position, he is a top lieutenant in House Republican leadership to Speaker Todd Huston and often presides over House floor sessions when Huston is away from the chamber.
Karickhoff’s announcement highlighted his work to combat the opioid crisis, strengthen economic development and protect the state’s natural resources. 
He also had sponsored bills in recent years aimed at allowing immigrants living in the country illegally to obtain driving-privilege cards and making some noncitizens eligible for in-state college tuition. But those proposals didn’t advance in the face of opposition from fellow Republicans pushing for a tighter immigration crackdown.
“I’ve always believed in practical solutions and respectful debate, and I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity to have worked alongside so many dedicated public servants,” Karickhoff said in his statement.
Karickhoff has easily won reelection in what has become a heavily Republican area since he defeated Democratic Rep. Ron Herrell in the 2010 election that gave Republicans the House majority they’ve held ever since.
Karickhoff served as Kokomo’s city park superintendent and Ivy Tech Community College’s executive director of facilities and was a Kokomo City Council member before his election to the Legislature.
Other legislators who aren’t running again
Karickhoff joins at least three other legislators who’ve announced this will be their final term in the General Assembly. Those are:

Rep. Shane Lindauer, R-Jasper, who has served in the House since 2017 and is chair of the House Natural Resources Committee.
Sen. Eric Bassler, R-Washington, who was first elected to the Senate in 2014 and is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Sen. Greg Walker, R-Columbus, who was first elected to the Senate in 2006 and is chair of the Senate’s Family and Children Services Committee.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Karickhoff-2-2025.jpg,,,2025-11-04 13:02:34.067383

Pumpkins for Pigs: After Halloween, pumpkins without paint, glitter, or other harmful decorations can be donated to farmers for their animals
By Jamie Kleman | Contributing Writer Delaware Live | October 2025
When Halloween decorations come down and jack-o’-lanterns fade, many pumpkins are left without purpose. Across the country, the nonprofit Pumpkins for Pigs Foundation (PFPF) steps in to change that. Founded in Loudoun County, Virginia, the organization has grown into a national network spanning 44 states and Canada, connecting communities with local farms that can put leftover pumpkins to good use.
In Delaware, PFPF partners with farms and sanctuaries where animals enjoy pumpkins as seasonal treats. The initiative not only provides nourishment but also helps reduce food waste and support sustainable farming. While some pumpkins may remain as Thanksgiving decorations, when it’s time to clear them away, these farms ensure they’re eaten and not discarded.
After Halloween, pumpkins without paint, glitter, or other harmful decorations can be donated. Both carved and uncarved pumpkins are accepted by many farms, and some offer local pick-up. Checking each farm’s guidelines or making a quick phone call ensures smooth coordination. Your pumpkin goes from porch to pig pen, turning a seasonal leftover into something beneficial.

Jackson is proud to welcome the National Folk Festival, and there’s a real sense of excitement here as we prepare for this landmark event.
For three days – this Friday through Sunday –  our city will be the heart of a celebration that brings together music, art and community from every corner of the nation. The National Folk Festival is a free event open to everyone, giving residents and visitors a chance to experience music, art and culture in the heart of downtown Jackson.
As the festival arrives, downtown Jackson businesses are energized, opening their doors to guests with local cuisine and displays of the city’s creative talent. It puts Jackson on the map for thousands of visitors, giving us a chance to share our history, our food and what makes us unique.
Walking through downtown, you’ll hear everything from blues to bluegrass and see artists showcasing their craft. If you stop for a bite to eat, you’ll notice the pride our chefs and cooks take in every dish – fried catfish, barbecue, homemade pecan pie. Each plate carries a story.

We believe the real foundation of the National Folk Festival isn’t found in the performances alone, but in the connections made between people. Jackson’s greatest strength has always been our community. Folks around here greet you like family, and it’s common to see neighbors lending a hand or sharing local lore with newcomers.
This spirit is at the core of what we’re offering to visitors.Jackson takes pride in our rich stories and creative traditions.
This year, the festival’s Legacies of Empowerment program, curated by the Mississippi Arts Commission, salutes two giants of Mississippi history: civil rights leader Medgar Evers and blues legend B.B. King, both marking 100 years since their birth.
Across several stages, festivalgoers will hear music shaped by King’s unmistakable blues, gospel inspired by the fight for equal rights, and experience the talents of HBCU choirs, hip hop artists, punk, Mexican huapango musicians and Choctaw dancers.
Guests can meet craftspeople, quilters, skateboard designers, sign painters and farmers, who all demonstrate the ingenuity and community spirit that set Jackson and Mississippi apart. 
Getting ready to host the festival has meant a team effort. The city’s departments have come together to spruce up parks, resurface streets and clean up public spaces.
We’re making sure venues are accessible, signage is clear and the downtown area puts its best foot forward. Our local artists and musicians are stepping up, preparing performances and pop-up exhibits that show off their skills.
Safety is a top priority, too. City police, fire and emergency teams have coordinated plans to keep visitors and residents safe throughout the festival. We’re working with volunteers and civic groups to provide assistance and emergency support, so guests know they can enjoy themselves without worry.
The National Folk Festival also offers a chance for Jackson’s students and youth organizations to get involved through volunteering and art showcases. It’s an opportunity to highlight the next generation of Mississippi creators.
This festival means more than fresh faces and business for our city. It’s about proudly sharing who we are. Every visitor who stops in a local shop, cheers for a band or sits down for a meal helps support our city’s local businesses and strengthens Jackson’s reputation as a center for music and culture.
As mayor, I invite you to experience this celebration for yourself. Talk to our people, enjoy the music and let Jackson surprise you. With every handshake and shared meal, you’ll see what makes our city special.
We’re getting ready for a festival that’s unforgettable, and we hope it leaves you feeling right at home in Mississippi’s capital.
Welcome to Jackson. Enjoy the National Folk Festival, an event where art, culture and community come together.

Three months after union workers walked off the job on strike, five Democratic senators pilloried the plan for replacement workers as potentially putting the nation’s military at risk. 
“For existing projects, such as the F-15 Eagle and the F/A-18 Hornet, you are also unnecessarily endangering our warfighters by insisting on proceeding with an untrained and hastily recruited workforce,” says a letter the senators sent Tuesday to Boeing’s President and CEO Kelly Ortberg.
It was signed by U.S. Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mazie K. Hirono of Hawaii and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan.
Also Tuesday, Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri sent his own letter to Ortbrerg, demanding the company negotiate in good faith with striking workers. 
“These workers help produce our Nation’s most crucial, most advanced, and most expensive defense tools,” Hawley wrote. “And since your company receives billions in government contracts, it is incumbent upon you to do the right thing.”
More than 3,200 workers are on strike at Boeing’s three facilities in St. Louis, St. Charles and Mascoutah, Ill. They’re members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union.
Strike negotiations have reached a stalemate, as Boeing refuses to add more money to any agreement and union members refuse to come back to work until they do. 
Boeing did not immediately respond to The Independent’s request for comment on the senators’ letter.
Last week, Steve Parker, executive vice president of The Boeing Company and president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, wrote employees a letter stating the company is “moving forward with the next phase of its contingency plan.” 
“We are accelerating our efforts to hire permanent replacement workers, which will likely result in some striking employees being displaced,” he said.
Parker also said Boeing will be “expanding the use of third-party support for certain jobs and assessing opportunities to streamline factory operations.” 
“And we’re welcoming back teammates who are crossing the picket line as we continue to hear from more teammates who tell us they are ready to come back to work,” Parker said in his email to employees.
Union leaders say the people who would provide the necessary training to certify these replacement employees are on the strike line. In their letter, the Democratic senators note that St. Louis-area facilities are crucial to the construction of the new F-47 fighter jet and NGAD fighters. 
“If you choose to proceed with replacement workers to complete these projects, you will be sacrificing the needs of the U.S. military in order to benefit the corporation’s bottom line,” the letter states. “Rather than proceeding down this dangerous path, we urge you to rededicate yourself to meeting the needs of your current workers, who are a fount of experience, knowledge and professionalism.”
Pressure from Congress urging Boeing to cut a better deal for its workers has continued to grow these last month, as more senators have said the strike is threatening national security. 
Hawley has repeatedly slammed Boeing for its behavior in the strike negotiations, including at a Senate hearing last month where others also voiced their outrage.
Members of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee sent a letter to Boeing Defense last week urging its leaders to offer a fair contract in the name of national security.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Airforce acknowledged that the 86-day strike at Boeing’s St. Louis facilities has delayed the delivery of F-15EX fighter jets, according to answers Gen. Kenneth S. Wilsbach provided to a U.S. Senate committee in his nomination for Air Force chief of staff. 
Boeing workers have voted against four of the company’s contract offers, which all failed to include the 401(k) 100% match that workers have been demanding since the strike began on Aug. 4 as well as their proposed raise increase and signing bonus. 
Jody Bennett, resident general vice president of International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union, said Boeing’s latest offer was “barely a shuffling” of prior offers. 
The union gave the company a counter offer last week that took the 401(k) 100% match off the table and broke up their requested $10,000 bonus by getting $5,000 the first year and $5,000 in the third year.
The company rejected it. Parker wrote in his letter to employees that the union “asked for more money after we’ve repeatedly said more is not coming.” 
In a statement Tuesday, the union said the difference between the IAM Union’s proposal last week and Boeing’s last rejected offer is roughly $8 million over four years, and called it “a fraction of what the company spends on executive bonuses and makes from the world-class defense products our members produce.”
“Boeing needs to bargain its way out of this strike — and your IAM Bargaining Committee remains ready to bargain in good faith when they are,” it states.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boeing-rally-scaled-e1762277454936-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-11-04 13:02:34.067383

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The five members of Alaska’s highest court heard arguments last Thursday in a long-running dispute between the operators of a Christian camp and the Fairbanks North Star Borough about whether or not the camp qualifies for an exemption from local property taxes.
Though the dispute involves only a single camp in Fairbanks, the justices’ ruling could redraw the limits that decide when religious groups’ operations qualify for tax exemptions in Alaska.
In court, an attorney representing the borough and one representing the camp’s operator, Victory Ministries of Alaska, said the key question is whether Camp Li-Wa was used exclusively for charitable purposes during 2021. 
The borough and Victory Ministries disagree on other years’ taxes, but only one dispute was escalated to the Supreme Court.
The borough contends that because Victory Ministries operates a Christian Bible camp for only two months during the year, it should not be able to claim tax-exempt status for the remaining 10 months of the year, or on buildings not used by the camp.
In arguing its case, the borough submitted advertising material published by Victory Ministries that described the camp as “currently one of the finest retreat locations in the Interior of Alaska” and said it was advertised for vacations, recreation and other profitable purposes, not just charity.
The borough also submitted financial documents obtained from Camp Li-Wa, suggesting that the camp was used more for commercial, profitable purposes than charitable ones.
Victory Ministries fought back, saying that the camp operates at a deficit, and — among other arguments — that paying users are not required to be nonprofit groups, and that charity can involve self-care and pleasure. 
In 2024, a Fairbanks Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the borough, causing the defendants to appeal to the Supreme Court. 
In part, the operators of Camp Li-Wa argue that the borough and superior court “erred by improperly limiting what constitutes ‘charitable activity’ in violation of the state constitutional protections.”
Janella Kamai, attorney for Victory Ministries of Alaska, told the justices that while Camp Li-Wa may offer programs like horseback riding for a fee, “The fun activities, it’s just a sideline. The purpose is to provide the churches, the schools, with a place for them to host their own spiritual retreats and community events.”
She said the camp’s mission applies even if someone who isn’t religious comes to the camp. “You have to understand that Victory operates to both evangelize and proselytize. Evangelism means they’re going to bring people onto the campus so that they can introduce them to the concepts of Christian camping, introduce them to Camp Li-Wa, so if they want to know more, they can,” Kamai said.
In many cases, the camp is being used as a religious retreat, she said.
Ehren Lohse, the attorney representing the Fairbanks North Star Borough, said that under the borough’s definitions, a retreat isn’t a charitable activity.
“A retreat, by definition, is time away from your other work. So they may be doing charitable and religious work at their normal places,” he said of camp users, “but when they’re having a retreat, that can happen anywhere.”
Justice Dario Borghesan said that raises a problem for the justices: There’s no way to know whether camp users were engaging in religious activity or taking a break.
“I’m just not sure how ultimately this gets resolved,” he said.
The court took the case under consideration at the end of Thursday’s hearing and will issue a written order at a future date.

(Kaylie Tupper/for South Dakota Searchlight)A state commission on Monday cleared the Rapid City Area School Board of allegations that it violated state transparency laws in its handling of a former superintendent’s contract termination.
During a meeting in Pierre, the South Dakota Open Meetings Commission ruled against former Superintendent Nicole Swigart. The school board voted to terminate her contract in August 2024 after the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights issued a report containing insensitive remarks she allegedly made in reference to Native American students and families. Swigart denied making the statements.
Swigart filed an open meetings complaint last November alleging that the board committed four violations of state open-meetings laws in its handling of her personnel matter. The allegations included her claim that the board illegally made its decision about her in a closed-door, executive session before the board voted in public.
Open meetings laws specifically list discussions of “the qualifications, competence, performance, character or fitness of any public officer or employee” as a justifiable reason to conduct an executive session.
Commissioner Emily Sovell moved to dismiss the complaint, and fellow commissioners agreed the school board had not broken the law. 
Sanitary district found in violation
In another case, the commission ruled that the Green Valley Sanitary District in Pennington County violated the state’s open meetings laws by failing to properly cite a legal reason before entering executive session and by improperly stopping a citizen from recording a public meeting last year.
Steve Myers filed the complaint. He told the commission that during a meeting on April 10, 2024, the board entered executive session without citing a law or qualifying reason, as required by state law. The motion simply stated that the board would discuss a complaint Myers had filed, which is not one of the allowable reasons under state law to turn a public meeting private.
Myers also said that at a May 8, 2024, meeting, the board violated state law that allows the public to record open meetings. Myers said he announced he was recording, but a board member told him to stop or the meeting would be adjourned.
Ty Daly, the sanitary district’s attorney, said the district’s board members complied with the law. He said the purpose of the April 10 executive session was to discuss pending or proposed litigation with legal counsel, which is an allowable purpose for an executive session. 
He also said the board acted “in good faith” in asking Myers to stop recording.
“The purpose was to prevent disruption and avoid residents or the public being recorded without their permission,” he said.
Commissioners found that whatever the purpose for the executive session, the board had failed to meet the legal requirement that public bodies clearly state the reason for closing a meeting. They also found the May 8 incident violated open meeting laws because the disruption stemmed from the board’s decision to tell Myers to stop recording, not Myers’ recording itself.
The commission will issue written reprimands for the violations.

Free.,It’s small businesses versus Trump in tariff case before the Supreme Court,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/its-small-businesses-versus-trump-tariff-case-supreme-court,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court will hear one of the first major cases of President Donald Trump’s second term Wednesday, when the administration defends the president’s emergency tariffs that American small business owners say are upending their livelihoods.The question at the heart of the case is whether Trump can authorize sweeping tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA — the first time a president has used the statute to impose taxes on imports.The suit, which challenges the bounds of Trump’s presidential power, is the first of the administration’s appeals to the high court to be fully argued before the high court on its merits. The justices have so far addressed Trump’s numerous appeals on other issues on what is known as the shadow docket, a fast track to make a decision without full arguments.The president initially said he would attend the arguments in person but has since changed course and will go to a business forum in Miami Wednesday.The high court convenes at 10 a.m. Eastern and live audio of the arguments is posted on the court’s website.

The tariff case is “one for the ages,” said Michael McConnell, professor and faculty director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School and member of the legal team representing the small businesses challenging Trump's tariffs.“The president has important powers that come directly from the Constitution, but he has no power to impose taxes on American citizens without the authorization of Congress, and tariffs are taxes on American importers,” said McConnell, who sat on the bench of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit from 2002 to 2009.““IEEPA simply does not apply here,” he told reporters during an Oct. 28 virtual press conference. “It is a statute about imposing various forms of sanctions, economic sanctions, on countries with whom we are in conflict. It has nothing to do with imposing taxes on Americans for engaging in perfectly lawful trade with friendly nations.”Tariffs a ‘terrible and unsustainable weight’Victor Schwartz, founder and president of VOS Selections, a family-owned wine and spirits importer in business for four decades, said Trump’s tariff policy is an “existential threat.” Schwartz is the lead plaintiff in one of two consolidated cases brought by small business owners and Democratic state attorneys general to challenge the duties that can range from 10% to 50%, depending on the product’s origin.“These tariffs threaten the very existence of small businesses like mine, making it difficult to survive, let alone grow,” Schwartz told reporters during the Oct. 28 virtual press call.“Let me be clear, Americans are paying these tariffs, not foreign entities, and the tariffs are a terrible and unsustainable weight. We have to pay tariffs immediately at the port of entry, and we don't see revenue from those products for at least five or six months,” Schwartz said.Schwartz said he and his daughter, with whom he runs the business, can no longer import wines from South Africa, as tariffs on products from that country are set at 30%.Other businesses that joined Schwartz on the lawsuit include a Utah-based plastics producer, a Virginia-based children’s electricity learning kit maker, a Pennsylvania-based fishing gear company and a Vermont-based women’s cycling apparel company.Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon were among states, led by Democratic state attorneys general, that also sued.The U.S. Court of International Trade and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sided with the plaintiffs in finding Trump’s IEEPA tariffs unconstitutional.The justices will also hear from two Illinois-based toy companies who, in a separate case, challenged Trump’s emergency tariffs. Learning Resources Inc. and hand2mind manufacture most of their educational toys in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand and India. Imports from those countries are taxed anywhere from 15% to above 50%, and in the case of China have been unpredictable.Trump says ‘country is wealthy again’ Trump told reporters Sunday aboard Air Force One that the case is “one of the most important decisions in the history of our country.”In an interview with the CBS show “60 Minutes” that aired Sunday night, Trump said the economy “will go to hell” if the high court invalidates his emergency tariffs.“Because of tariffs, our country is wealthy again,” the president told CBS correspondent Norah O’Donnell, arguing his use of tariffs as a negotiation tool will yield billions of dollars in investment in the United States from other countries. Many of the framework trade deals Trump has announced, including with the European Union, South Korea and Japan, are not yet finalized.The government has so far collected $195 billion this year in customs duties at the end of September, according to a U.S. Treasury monthly statement.In a September filing asking the Supreme Court to expedite the case, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wrote the U.S. would face “catastrophic” financial consequences, up to $1 trillion, if the emergency tariffs were overturned.

In the same filing, U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer argued the import taxes are Trump’s “most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative … which President Trump has determined are necessary to rectify America’s country-killing trade deficits and to stem the flood of fentanyl across our borders.” The administration is facing pushback on those arguments. Scott Lincicome, senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said a ruling against the tariffs “would not lead to financial ruin, as the administration has said.”“The government also claims that 'With tariffs, we are a rich nation. Without tariffs, we are a poor nation,' — except studies of the fiscal trajectory of the United States with both the IEEPA tariffs, and without, show that we are drowning in debt either way,” Lincicome told reporters at the late October press briefing.Cato filed a brief in the case arguing against the tariffs.Some Republicans break ranksThe case has attracted nearly two dozen friend-of-the-court briefs urging the justices to deem Trump’s IEEPA tariffs illegal, including one signed by hundreds of Democrats in Congress and one Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. The lawmakers argued IEEPA “contains none of the hallmarks of legislation delegating tariff power to the executive, such as limitations tied to specific products or countries, caps on the amount of tariff increases, procedural safeguards, public input, collaboration with Congress, or time limitations.”In the days leading up to the oral arguments, four Republican senators broke ranks to join Democrats in passing joint resolutions ending Trump’s emergency declarations triggering tariffs. One of the bills, passed Oct. 28, targeted Trump’s emergency declaration that led to 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, including that nation’s major export: coffee. The symbolic bills are not expected to be taken up in the GOP-led House, but mark a shift from when Senate Republicans blocked a similar measure in April.In its Supreme Court filing, Cato argued the administration’s reading of IEEPA “not only stretches the text beyond recognition but also undermines the Framers’ designs for the separation of powers. Accepting the government’s theory would mean that Congress, through ambiguous text and silence, can transfer sweeping legislative power to the President — a result this Court has cautioned against.”In an amicus brief supporting Trump’s trade strategy, the America First Policy Institute, a conservative think tank heavily involved in Trump’s second presidential campaign, defended the tariffs as a “pillar of the America-first policies of the current administration” and argued the president has unilateral power to impose the taxes under a Depression-era law.Executive orders and moreTrump began imposing tariffs under IEEPA through a series of executive orders and proclamations in February and March on products from China, Canada and Mexico, declaring these countries responsible for illegal fentanyl smuggling into the U.S. The president escalated the emergency tariffs over the following months on goods from around the globe, declaring trade imbalances a national emergency. In addition to a baseline 10% global tariff, Trump specifically targeted countries that export more goods to the U.S. than they import from U.S. suppliers.As recently as late August, Trump imposed an extra 25% tariff on goods imported from India, bringing the total tariffs on Indian products to 50%, because of the country’s usage of Russian oil. In early August, Trump slapped a 40% tax on all Brazilian goods after he disagreed with the country’s prosecution of its former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro for plotting a coup to remain in power in 2022.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-11-04 12:06:19.429279

Deputy’s 234-page book, released Sept. 3, 2025, follows his years of research into the Spring Grove Mill House and the surprising people and events connected to it. The narrative moves from Revolutionary War strategy sessions to an Apollo 11 thread, from a plot involving Lee Harvey Oswald to a George Washington leadership turning point, and even to deal-making that helped legalize gambling in Delaware.
Author Dave Deputy recalls buying the Spring Grove Mill House with little sense of its past—then learning it was far older than advertised and once part of an early-1700s milling site. “One day I found a Revolutionary War map online,” he says. “There was a blast of yellow—an explosion—centered right where our house stands. The caption showed combat here in 1777.” That discovery led him to General George Weedon’s foray at Spring Grove, a skirmish he argues helped tilt momentum toward the Americans. Citing filmmaker Ken Burns’ framing of the Revolution as a world-shaping birth of democracy, Deputy places Spring Grove’s 1777 moment in that larger current of history.
For New Castle County readers, the story lands close to home. The house at the center of the book is in Delaware, and Deputy uses familiar landscapes—mill roads, farmsteads, and river corridors—to show how seemingly ordinary local places carry national echoes. The result doubles as a call to action for area residents: look again at the houses you pass every day. Many, Deputy suggests, hold untold chapters of the American story.
That local lens extends beyond storytelling. Drawing on his background as a brigadier general and state trooper, Deputy blends strategic perspective with investigative detail to model how anyone can dig into a property’s past—through deeds, maps, newspaper archives, and interviews. Those do-it-yourself tools make the book a natural fit for county book clubs, libraries, school projects, and historical societies interested in preservation, genealogy, and community history.
Deputy keeps the pacing accessible, stitching “strange-but-true” Americana to practical guidance. It’s part hidden-history thriller, part research handbook—particularly suited to a county where 18th- and 19th-century structures still anchor neighborhoods and main streets.

(Photo by Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)Young homebuyers have been priced out of the market even more than previously, according to a report released Nov. 4 by the National Association of Realtors.
“As a result of decreased housing affordability and limited housing inventory, potential first-time buyers retreated further from the housing market,” the report stated, comparing homebuyers between July 2024 and June 2025 to previous years.
The share of first-time homebuyers dropped to a new low of 21% of all buyers, and the median age of those first-time buyers increased to 40, up from as low as the late 20s in the 1980s.
Older repeat buyers with cash offers and large down payments now dominate the market, according to the report. Repeat buyers had a median age of 62, the oldest in the report’s 44-year history.
Among the states trying to help first-time buyers: Florida, which offers mortgages and down payment assistance, and Michigan, which has exhausted the funds in the first-generation, first-time buyer program it announced in February.
In October, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said he plans an “aggressive” approach to zoning changes to create 35,000 starter homes aimed at first-time buyers, including a state preemption of local rules, though similar state laws failed earlier in the year.
“I don’t want my grandkids to be in Indiana,” Cox said in a recent speech, saying one of his sons was considering a move there to find a more affordable house.
Homebuying options remain slim for middle-income earners

Convenience to work location continues to decline as a reason for choosing a neighborhood in which to buy. It’s down to 31%, from 34% last year and 46% before the pandemic in 2019, despite recent increases in employer demands to work from the office, according to the new Realtors report.
The reasons most buyers cite for choosing a home are quality of the neighborhood (59%) and convenience to friends and family (47%).
This fall, the federal government shutdown also might be affecting potential buyers if they are trying to purchase a home in certain flood zones, because new government flood insurance contracts are suspended, according to the National Association of Homebuilders. That could leave new homebuyers in some areas unable to close or exposed to risks in high-risk states such as Florida and North Carolina, according to Realtor.com. In other cases, homebuyers might have to turn to costlier private insurance.
The overall cost of buying a new home is near all-time highs, with monthly payments for the median-priced house consuming almost half the median household income in August, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The last time it was below an affordable 30% was in 2021.
Lower interest rates, higher incomes made homes more affordable in June

Prices have been rising fastest in the Midwest because of the region’s relative affordability, and in the Northeast because of the scarcity of homes for sale, according to an August report by the National Association of Realtors. Florida, Texas and other Southern states have seen price decreases because of new home construction, according to that report.
Median sales prices in the second quarter ranged from $146,000 in Decatur, Illinois, to $2.1 million in California’s Silicon Valley, according to the same report.
Governments and financial institutions are continuing to roll out programs they say can help. In September, New York state announced a plan to build starter homes to be built with manufactured components on vacant land owned by nonprofit land banks for the purpose of building affordable housing and other community needs.
California’s Dream For All program offers up to $150,000 for down payments or closing costs to first-time, first-generation homebuyers, though applications are closed until 2026.
And the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati expanded a program giving $25,000 for down payments to first-time, first-generation homebuyers. The program started in Kentucky and expanded to western Tennessee counties.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-04 15:46:49+00:00,Mississippi Today,"In my next life, I want to be a fired big-time college football head coach",Rick Cleveland,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/04/in-my-next-life-i-want-to-be-a-fired-big-time-college-football-head-coach/,Universities are doling out tens of millions of dollars to fired football coaches.,"Auburn head coach Hugh Freeze reacts during the second half of an NCAA college football game against Kentucky, Saturday, Nov. 1, 2025, in Auburn, Ala. (AP Photo/Butch Dill)
Is this any way to run a business?
That should be the first question asked to anyone involved in big-time college football these days.
Let’s take a look around the SEC, shall we?
LSU presumably owes Brian Kelly $53 million after firing him. This comes just as the Baton Rouge school makes final payments on a $17 million buyout of Ed Orgeron, the former Ole Miss coach. That’s $70 million right there LSU has paid – or will pay – football coaches not to coach. The Tigers got out cheap on Les Miles, the LSU head coach before Orgeron. They only paid Miles a lump sum of $1.5 million not to coach.
Rick Cleveland
And it’s not just LSU. Now let’s look at Florida, which recently fired Billy Napier. Florida must pay Napier more than $21 million not to coach. That includes half the buyout paid immediately and then monthly installments through 2029. That’s not all. Florida reportedly still pays Dan Mullen, the former Mississippi State coach and current UNLV coach, to coach elsewhere. Mullen’s buyout in 2021 was $12 million. He got $6 million immediately and the rest in yearly installments of $1 million, the last of which will be paid in 2027. Jim McIlwain, the Gators coach before Mullen, was paid $7.5 million after his firing. Will Muschamp, fired before McIlwain, was paid $6.3 million over four years. Pretty soon, we are going to be talking about some real money.
So, let’s do. Texas A&M, which fired Jimbo Fisher in 2023  will pay him $7.2 million annually through 2031 for a total buyout of approximately $77 million. That’s a record that will be hard to break.
Funny thing: A&M pays Fisher more not to coach than it pays Mike Elko to coach. At least the Aggies are getting a bigger bang for their buck with Elko, who has his team undefeated and ranked No. 3 nationally. Elko’s contract runs through 2030, at which time the school will still be paying Fisher more than $7 mill at year. Heavens to Betsy, I mean, to Jimbo!!!
Before Fisher, A&M bought out Kevin Sumlin for a mere $10 million. Look, I know they’ve got a lot of oil money in Texas, but does it all go to fired football coaches? I ask because Texas paid Tom Herman $10 million not to coach. Before Herman, Texas paid Charley Strong $10 million not to coach. Before Strong, Texas bought out Mack Brown for $2.75 million. Yes, Texas bought out John Mackovic before hiring Mack Brown for another $1.8 million.
There’s a readily apparent pattern here, which shows that the more recent buyouts are much, much higher than those a decade ago. We can only imagine what they will be like in 2035.
Not to worry, Auburn will probably find out. Auburn just fired former Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze and must pay him $16 million not to coach. That follows a $15.3 million buyout for Bryan Harsin and a $21 million buyout for Gus Malzahn. There are not that many oil wells in Alabama.
Arkansas? The Razorbacks just fired Sam Pittman and must pay him $8.7 million – not to coach. Before Pittman, Arkansas bought out Chad Morris for $8 million. Before Morris, Arkansas paid Brett Bielema $8 million not to coach. Interesting to note: Bobby Petrino did not get a buyout when Arkansas fired him back in 2012. His contract called for an $18 million payout, but Arkansas didn’t have to pay it because Petrino was fired for cause. (Remember the sordid motorcycle accident/extra-marital affair happening?) And wouldn’t you know it? Petrino is back for an encore performance as the Razorbacks’ interim head coach. Thus far, he is 0-4. You really couldn’t make this stuff up.
Understand, these buyouts aren’t just restricted to head coaches. Every time a head coach is fired, the employer also must buy out most, if not all, his assistants. And sometimes an assistant coach is fired before the head coach. That’s what happened at South Carolina this week after Saturday’s 30-14 loss to Ole Miss. South Carolina head coach Shane Beamer on Monday fired his offensive coordinator, Mike Shula, who was in the first year of a three-year contract. South Carolina now must pay Shula $2 million not to call plays. Shula is no stranger to buyouts. Alabama once paid him $4 million to no longer be its head coach.
This isn’t just an SEC deal. The madness is elsewhere, as well. Ten months after guiding Penn State into the national semifinals, James Franklin was canned by Penn State, which now must pay him a $50 million buyout. Historically, that’s second only to Fisher’s massive buyout at A&M. That’s not all. Oklahoma State, UCLA, Virginia Tech, Stanford, Oregon State, Colorado State and UAB all fired coaches before the 2025 calendar reached November. Most, if not all, will pay significant buyouts.
The good news in Mississippi is that we aren’t looking at any huge football coach buyouts any time soon. Ole Miss probably will have to pony up two kings’ ransoms just to keep Lane Kiffin, who already makes nearly $10 million a year. Mississippi State would be foolish to fire Jeff Lebby, who has engineered a remarkable turn-around in 2025. At Southern Miss, Charles Huff would be the Sun Belt’s coach of the year if the season ended now. With continued success, his services will be in great demand elsewhere.
Besides, state law limits Mississippi’s state-supported schools from offering contracts of more than four years. That law has often been criticized over the years – not from this corner. Fisher’s A&M contract was for 10 years. Franklin’s Penn State contract was for 10 years. So was Kelly’s at LSU. That’s why the buyouts were so high. By law, that can’t happen in Mississippi. You ask me, that’s a good thing.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/04093008/AP25306125368412.jpg,,,2025-11-04 10:57:00.384296

Open enrollment for the individual health plans began over the weekend, with many North Carolinians experiencing sticker shock compared to previous years. At the same time the tax credits are expiring, premiums are also increasing sharply for many insurance enrollees.
U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (Photo: Screen capture from press conference)
U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) told reporters on a conference call Monday that over the past five years, the number of North Carolinians who have access to health care through the health insurance marketplace has almost doubled. Nearly 975,000 rely on the program today.
If Congress fails to extend the enhanced subsidies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands may no longer be able to afford their coverage.
“A 60-year-old North Carolina couple earning about $83,000 a year could see their premiums increased by more than $18,000 a year, triple what they’re now paying,” warned Klobuchar.
“It is simply a gut punch that too many families simply can’t afford,” Klobuchar said.
The enhanced premium tax credits enabled small business owners and self-employed individuals to afford coverage. But state Senator Gladys Robinson (D-Guilford) worries that too could change if premiums rise.
Robinson said a family in her district earning $60,000 a year cannot afford rising health care premiums along with rising rent, food and childcare costs.
“So, they will have to let that health care go,” Robinson said. “And then their children will be sick. Their families will be sick. And it just will not work for families in North Carolina.”
Small business owner Daniel Ayers.
Daniel Ayers said when he made a career pivot during the pandemic from being a classroom teacher to a small business owner, he turned to the ACA for coverage.
He credits the ability to afford coverage in the marketplace with changing his life back in the spring of 2023.
“I got injured. I needed knee surgery and without the coverage I got through the ACA, I would not have been able to afford that care,” Ayers said.
Ayers said as a small business owner, he would have been forced to delay treatment without coverage, possibly until the situation was much worse and required more invasive surgery.
On Monday, Ayers allowed himself to open up the healthcare.gov portal to take a look at what his 2026 premiums would be.
“To put it bluntly, I was stunned,” Ayers said. “The cost has gone up so much, now I do have to face it. Will I go without insurance next year? Just hoping I don’t get sick or injured.”
U.S. Senator Ted Budd (R-NC) suggested on social media that the rising health care costs could be attributed to structural flaws in Obamacare, costly new drugs, and surging medical costs “tied to Bidenflation.”
Robinson said Budd needs to remember the rural counties he represents.
State Senator Gladys Robinson (D-Guilford)
“Those rural counties have farmers and small businesses, and everybody will be affected.  While you work on improvements to the ACA, you need to make sure they continue to get health care coverage,” said Robinson.
Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) has urged his colleagues to embrace a two-year extension for the enhanced premium subsidies. Tillis told Bloomberg Government last week that failure to extend those credits would cost some voters their ACA coverage just before the midterms, a risky strategy for some U.S. House members facing re-election.
A KFF Health Tracking Poll released in early October found 78% of the public wants Congress to extend the enhanced tax credits to make the health coverage purchased through the ACA Marketplace more affordable. That includes 57% of those who identified as “Make American Great Again” supporters.
Klobuchar cautioned that with the open enrollment period here, North Carolinians are already pricing out their options, determining if they can afford coverage moving forward.

Immigrant rights advocates such as Sonia Hernandez, a member of Make the Road Connecticut, say it acts as a show of support for Bridgeport’s immigrant population.
“We need your help to stand up and speak up that you are saying, that you are with us and immigrant families, we are welcoming, we are defending and you stand out with us,” Hernandez said.
The resolution was passed after weeks of back and forth discussions with city officials and legal experts, who worried about the possibility of retaliation from the federal government.
New policies implemented through the resolution will impact all city departments, including the police department. The resolution does not grant federal immigration authoritiesaccess to the city’s surveillance cameras. City departments can also publicly disclose when federal agencies request information on immigrants in the city.
[RELATED: As CT cities weigh ICE policies, some residents want more action]
The resolution also states the city is barred from providing information to ICE, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or other federal agencies tasked with immigration enforcement.
Only one City Council member, AmyMarie Vizzo-Paniccia, voted against the resolution, after several immigrant rights advocates spoke during the public comment section, including Daira Mairin of Make the Road Connecticut, who read a letter from a resident.
“This vote is about safety, dignity and justice, not politics,” Mairin said.
Many of the policies in the resolution are not applicable if cooperation is required by federal law. Despite these challenges, immigrant rights advocates say the resolution is not only an affirmation of support from the city, but one of many ways local communities can advocate for migrants.
Maggie Mitchell Salem is the executive director of Integrated Refugee & Immigrant Services (IRIS), an immigration resettlement agency and nonprofit. Mitchell Salem says the resolution is an act of unity, demonstrating local communities are not in favor of federal deportation efforts. She referenced former President George H.W. Bush, who regularly referred to a “thousand points of light” when referring to the power of community advocacy.
“Right now, we need a million points of light across America,” Mitchell Salem said. “And that’s local governments taking action.”
Mitchell Salem also said she sympathizes with city governments like Bridgeport that are being forced to take a strong stance against the federal government.
Governments, and other immigrant and refugee resettlement agencies, according to Mitchell Salem, have been forced to either keep a low profile or publicly condemn the federal government, bracing for federal scrutiny or retribution. Each one of these organizations and city governments, she said, has to make a calculated decision that won’t further harm the communities they serve.
But Mitchell Salem said there is also power in local governments making a statement, no matter how symbolic.
“It’s absolutely the right thing to do, even if what your local government can do, or your state government can do, is limited,” Mitchell Salem said. “It’s important to try to push against those limits and do everything we can, because what’s happening now is brutal, disgusting and inhumane.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bridgeport-city-hall-CT-Public-file-1024x683.webp,,,2025-11-04 10:16:55.063625

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)On the eve of Virginia’s statewide elections, President Donald Trump held a tele-rally aimed at boosting Republican turnout — but the GOP’s three statewide nominees were not invited to join the call, according to reporting from NewsNation.
Only Gov. Glenn Youngkin participated, even though the event was billed as a get-out-the-vote push for the party’s ticket.
Youngkin said the exclusion of Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican nominee for governor, along with lieutenant governor nominee John Reid and Attorney General Jason Miyares, was Trump’s decision, not the campaign’s.
“It was just me. Nobody else was either,” Youngkin said. “He just asked to do it with me.”
Trump has taken different approaches in the two gubernatorial contests on the ballot this year. He fully endorsed New Jersey Republican Jack Ciattarelli earlier in that state’s primary season, but in Virginia he has stopped short of a formal endorsement of Earle-Sears, even as he has offered public praise for her candidacy.
Youngkin pushed back when asked why Trump still hasn’t officially endorsed Earle-Sears.
“He has come out very favorably about the lieutenant governor. He called her an excellent candidate. He called Abigail Spanberger a terrible candidate,” Youngkin said, referring to the Democratic nominee.“We did a … tele-rally on Thursday night, and he was very, very positive on the lieutenant governor and her winning as governor,” Youngkin added, referring to a similar event from last week.
But when pressed again on why Earle-Sears wasn’t invited onto the call, he reiterated: “It was what Trump wanted.”

(File photo by Getty Images)About 3,600 babies born in South Carolina each year are diagnosed with opioid dependence, developed in the womb and passed to them from mothers struggling with addiction.
Researchers at Clemson University expect the number of infants born addicted is actually much higher, as many cases go unreported or undiagnosed. That’s why researchers, along with doctors at Prisma Health, are spreading the word about a hospital program aimed at helping opioid-addicted mothers and their newborns.
The program, called Managing Abstinence in Newborns (MAiN), is just one of the many organizations receiving grants from the state’s eventual $750 million share of legal payouts from national lawsuits filed against drug manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies. The settlement money, coming in installments over two decades, began arriving in 2022, when the Legislature passed a law creating a nine-member board to oversee the distribution.
Since then, the South Carolina Opioid Recovery Fund Board has disbursed $79 million in grants. Cities and counties that joined in lawsuit negotiations through the attorney general’s office largely get to decide how to spend their allotments. But the board must approve their applications.
So far, Pickens and Anderson counties have directed $1.7 million of their share to operate the MAiN program and raise awareness, according to reports posted to the opioid recovery board’s website.
SC overdose deaths are down, but new drugs are more fatal, officials say

How the program works
When a newborn is diagnosed with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, they’re often readmitted to the hospital two or three days after birth with symptoms of withdrawal. The babies often cry nonstop or even suffer seizures, said Rachel Mayo, a Clemson public health professor.
Under normal circumstances, these babies are separated from their mothers as they spend about a month in the neonatal intensive care unit being weaned off the drugs.
But nearly 20 years ago, Prima Health Dr. Jennifer Hudson, medical director for newborn services at the Upstate-headquartered hospital system, developed treatment practices that keep the mom and baby together.
If a mother is in treatment for her opioid addiction, she is allowed to stay with her baby for the first week of treatment. During that time, doctors train her on administering methadone to her baby.
After a week, mom and baby return to the doctor’s office weekly for checkups. The parent and child also are assigned a home health nurse who visits regularly until the child turns 5.
The program, which started at Greenville Memorial in 2003, is now offered at 14 hospitals across the state, Mayo said. However, mothers are often unaware of the option, said the Clemson researcher.
For the past three years, Mayo and her team studied the unmet needs of mothers in the program. They interviewed the mothers and used the women’ s experiences as part of a marketing campaign.
“The goal here is to reach women and let them know there is help,” Mayo said. “So often there’s a stigma attached to addiction; they don’t even reveal it to family and friends.”
In Pickens County, between 12 and 16 mothers have gone through the program annually since 2023, when the opioid settlement money started covering part of the cost. In Anderson County, where AnMed Health operates the program, between 16 and 18 mothers receive treatment annually, Mayo said.
Mayo said her team’s next step is to brainstorm solutions to the roadblocks mothers face in getting treatment and work with counties to implement them.
For example, Mayo has found mothers may miss their child’s first follow-up appointment at the doctor’s office because they don’t have a car and don’t want to take a newborn on the bus, assuming bus service is available at all. Mayo suggested counties might be able to help fund rideshares for these mothers.

Other grants
Other uses of the opioid settlement money include hundreds of thousands of dollars provided to addiction treatment centers.
Grants pay for supplies of naloxone, which can reverse an opioid overdose, to save lives and educate people on how to use it.
There’s also money for school programs that try to prevent opioid and other drug use among students, funding for hospitals to hire overdose and addiction specialists, and dollars for counties’ drug treatment courts that aim to help people struggling with addiction rather than simply imprison them.
All 46 counties and 43 cities in South Carolina that were involved in lawsuit negotiations are guaranteed a set share. A separate fund provides grants to smaller towns, hospitals, nonprofits and state agencies.
In the last two years, the grants provided treatment for about 74,300 adults and 7,640 children, and funded the distribution of 14,800 naloxone kits, according to the board’s annual reports.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/newborn-scaled-1-1024x617.jpg,,,2025-11-04 10:00:52.065312

Pete Williams worked for Cheney for seven years in Congress and the Pentagon. He recalls a boss who inspired loyalty, demonstrated patience and served the county with integrity.
The post The Dick Cheney I knew appeared first on WyoFile .","In June of 1989, shortly after Dick Cheney became secretary of defense and appointed me Pentagon spokesman, one of our senior policy officials had a request.

Opinion

A newspaper reporter wanted to know what was behind a new effort by the George H. W. Bush administration to reach a nuclear weapons agreement with the Soviet Union. The official sought my permission to provide some background.  
I relayed the request to Secretary Cheney, who had confidence in this senior official. He gave his OK but cautioned, “Make absolutely sure our guy talks it over with the White House and the State Department first to get a clear idea of what he can say.”
The following Sunday morning, the paper revealed that the president would soon propose the idea of first nailing down how to verify a weapons reduction — which had been the sticking point in the past — then negotiating the actual size of the drawdown.
President Bush intended to reveal that strategy in a speech Monday at the UN, and he was strongly displeased to see it spelled out beforehand. I received a call at home informing me that the senior official and I were to report to Secretary Cheney’s office first thing Monday.
We walked in and sat down, bracing for the worst. I thought to myself, it’s been a great three months in this job but now it’s over.
“The President of the United States is very angry with you both about the newspaper story,” Cheney told us. After a long and uncomfortable pause, he added, “But I told the president it was my idea.”
He could have said it was the fault of two rookie staffers. But he took the blame, saving us from ourselves. 
When the boss you serve cleans up after your mistakes, you can bet it inspires loyalty. Dick Cheney demonstrated that kind of decency and concern for the people who served him throughout his more than 40 years in public life.

Washington has always attracted ambitious people driven by a desire to serve their country, and no one can thrive in such a complicated place entirely alone. As the most successful people rise through the ranks, they benefit from the help of mentors and aides.  
But many of those who become big names in Washington acquire staffers and colleagues, only to discard them as they rise in stature, the way children cast aside clothes as they grow up.  
Not Dick Cheney. As he navigated the corridors of the capital, his circle of friends steadily grew. He did not abandon those who helped him along the way, instead adding to an expanding network of allies. 
Nor did he turn his back on Wyoming. His fellow members of the Natrona County High School class of 1959 went to more events at the White House and the vice-president’s residence than most people in Washington ever do. 
Case in point: The day after George W. Bush chose Cheney to be his running mate in 2000, Casper was their very first campaign stop. 
His service as vice-president was undoubtedly controversial. But there can be no serious question about his dedication to serving the nation with honesty and integrity. David Broder, the veteran Washington Post political columnist, said Cheney had “an emotional balance and mental discipline remarkable for anyone in the ego-ridden and risk-strewn field of government.”
Some critics called him the Darth Vader of the administration. He said he was OK with that, adding “It’s one of the nicer things I’ve been called.” He even showed up dressed as the Star Wars character for a “Tonight Show” interview with Jay Leno in 2011. That didn’t surprise me, because he had a sly, self-deprecating sense of humor. 
He often told a story about attending a political event when he ran for re-election as Wyoming’s congressman. He said he walked up to one old rancher, stuck out his hand, and said, “I’m Dick Cheney. I’m running for Congress, and I’d appreciate your vote.”
He said the rancher replied, “You’ve got it. That guy who’s in there now is no damned good.”
The discipline he showed in public service, his patience and deliberateness, was undoubtedly part of the appeal for him of fly fishing. When I turned 50, he presented me with an elaborate document inviting me to come along on a day’s fishing trip.
U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson speaks at the Ramada hotel in Casper, while Rep. Dick Cheney chuckles, in this archival image. (Casper Star-Tribune People Photographs, NCA 01.ii.2001.01 WyCaC US. Casper College Archives and Special Collections.) 
I told him that the best gift I could give him was to politely decline, because I was no fisherman and I would undoubtedly have ruined the day for him by talking too much. While he was unfailingly polite, he was never much for small talk — especially on the river.  
In my seven years of working for him in Congress and the Pentagon, I seldom came away from meeting with him without thinking that I’d learned something about politics and government. 
Lynne Cheney captured that notion perfectly when she introduced her husband at the 2000 Republican convention. 
“Conversations with Dick have a way of taking unexpected turns,” she said.  “Problems get redefined, and you find yourself thinking about things in new ways. I cannot imagine the discussion that would not benefit from his presence.”

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-04 14:02:26+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Survey: Mass. business confidence stuck in longest rut since pandemic,Chris Lisinski,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/economy/survey-mass-business-confidence-stuck-in-longest-rut-since-pandemic/,"Federal policy changes and high costs within Massachusetts continue to squeeze businesses, and by one metric, Bay State employers have not felt this negative about the economic outlook since the first year of the COVID pandemic.","NEARLY A YEAR into the second Trump administration, Democrats atop Beacon Hill are not the only ones unable to shake a sense of economic agita. 
Private sector employers have been feeling the strain, too, unsure about what degree of burden they should expect from tariffs and worried about the downstream effects of federal funding cuts to research. Some are frustrated less about Washington and more about the high cost of living in Massachusetts. 
The Associated Industries of Massachusetts, a trade group representing thousands of businesses, on Monday reported that business confidence dropped again in October, marking the eighth straight month in pessimistic territory. 
It’s the first time the group’s “business confidence index” has remained south of the line separating positive and negative outlooks for that long a stretch since 2020, the first year of the COVID pandemic.  
AIM cited several factors depressing business confidence, including the ongoing federal government shutdown, “rising prices,” and uncertainty about the Trump administration’s approach to tariffs. 
One unnamed employer responded to the survey noting that “federal government contracting is decreasing for small business and tariffs are hurting everyone.” 
Evan Horowitz, executive director of the Center for State Policy Analysis at Tufts University, said he found the continued negativity among businesses unsurprising. 
Massachusetts, he said, is likely already in a recession. 
“The driving force is federal,” Horowitz said. “It’s uncertainty around tariff policy, around immigration policy — the unparalleled levels of uncertainty and disruption resonating from Washington.” 
Other indicators also point to economic sluggishness in Massachusetts. Total employment across the state has been essentially flat for more than a year and a half. Over the past year, the statewide unemployment rate has slowly crept up to 4.8 percent, half a percentage point above the national rate. 
AIM’s business confidence index, published monthly based on a survey of employers, uses a 100-point scale. Scores above 50 represent a more optimistic outlook among participants, and scores below 50 mean members feel more pessimistic. 
The latest measurement of 46.5 — which is meant to signify employer readiness to expand and hire — was one point lower than September and nine points lower than one year ago. 
In the 34 years since AIM launched its index, there have been only six stretches of eight or more months with the measurement in negative territory, according to data shared with CommonWealth Beacon. The longest was May 2008 to April 2010 during the height of the Great Recession. 
Retailers Association of Massachusetts President Jon Hurst said while his members have also grappled with uncertainty from tariff threats, they often describe bigger concerns over state policymaking that’s been unable to rein in high costs. 
A February 2025 survey his organization and the UMass Donahue Institute, which conducts research on public policy and economic development, conducted with hundreds of small businessowners found 73 percent of respondents think government at all levels does “more to disadvantage small businesses than it does to help them.” 
“You’ve got to look at who’s causing the problem. Massachusetts, frankly, has the highest cost of doing business and the highest cost of living anywhere in the country,” Hurst said. “If you want to talk about pessimism, it’s the cost of living and the cost of doing business that creates the pessimism and unaffordability.” 
“That’s a Massachusetts problem,” he added. “That’s not a Washington problem.” 
Some analysts disagree on whether the economic outlook in Massachusetts is better or worse than the nation as a whole. 
In AIM’s latest survey, the national index fell to 38.2, a more pessimistic score than the Massachusetts index indicated for the state alone.  
Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said last month that 22 states, including Massachusetts, were either in a recession or at high risk of entering one. 
Horowitz suggested the Bay State’s footing is a little bit worse than its peers in part because its cornerstone industries — health care and education, or “meds and eds” — have been especially affected by federal funding cuts. 
“The industries that usually protect us are amplifying problems,” he said. 
Washington has long played an integral role in the Massachusetts’s innovation sector, providing an average of $8.6 billion per year in funding for research and development, according to a July report from the UMass Donahue Institute. 
The Trump administration has moved to cut hundreds of millions of those dollars, and both academic and business leaders warn that the knock-on effects could be enormous. 
“The impact of the loss of this federal funding stands to have the exact same type of impact on small and microbusinesses that we saw with COVID,” AIM president Brooke Thomson told lawmakers last week. 
Gov. Maura Healey filed legislation in July that would deploy $400 million in state funds — half from the surtax on wealthy households, half from interest generated by the state’s “rainy-day” savings account — to offset some of the federal changes. 
“The intersection between research, education, life sciences, tech, and health care is probably the greatest economic natural resource that Massachusetts has,” Doug Howgate, president of the business-backed Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, told lawmakers while testifying in support of Healey’s bill. “The risk that we face for federal changes is bigger than other places, and we need to act proactively to address that.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1-20250401_072601-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-04 09:19:08.555031

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)For wage-earning Alaskans who were displaced by the remnants of Typhoon Halong, a powerful storm that lashed the western coast of the state earlier this month, qualifying for one special type of federal assistance could be a cinch.
The U.S. Department of Labor’s Disaster Unemployment Assistance program provides financial benefits to people who cannot perform their normal jobs because of disaster interference. One qualification for the benefits — $153 to $370 per week for up to 27 weeks, according to the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development — is an inability to reach normal worksites.
Among the hundreds of Yukon-Kuskokwim region residents who were evacuated by military flights to Anchorage, nearly 500 miles to the east of their home villages, those that held wage-earning jobs in their home villages easily meet that requirement.
Beyond that weekly benefit, many evacuees will need to earn income over what might be a prolonged period away from home. To meet that need, companies and government agencies are seeking to place evacuees in temporary jobs and training programs.
At the forefront of those efforts is Calista Corporation, the Alaska Native corporation for the Yukon-Kuskokwim region. It has a series of programs underway to help displaced residents find work and training.
Cleanup and recovery work is a logical opportunity for people from storm-damaged villages, said Thom Leonard, Calista’s vice president for corporate affairs. But there are some obstacles to starting those recovery jobs.
“One of the challenges is: When are they going to go, and where are they going to stay if they are able to go back to the villages?” he said. Villages that lack power, water and other basic services might not yet be able to house the people who would do the cleanup and recovery work to make those villages habitable again, he said. “It’s kind of a chicken-and-egg situation,” he said.

	Calista’s construction and environmental services subsidiary, Calista Brice, has been enlisted in the disaster response and is hiring people from affected villages, Leonard said.
More generally, Calista and other partners held a career workshop on Wednesday for evacuees at the William A. Egan Civic and Convention Center in Anchorage, and more such events are planned. Through those events, Calista’s workforce and shareholder team, which operates a year-round program, is connecting displaced residents with job-training opportunities.
Calista has also offered temporary office space to tribal governments from Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, the coastal villages most heavily hit by the storm. The Kipnuk tribal government has taken Calista up on that offer, Leonard said.
Among the individuals getting help from Calista at the Egan Center on Tuesday were Carl and Stephanie Anaver of Kipnuk.
Stephanie inquired about the possibility of working as a home health care aide for her aged sister, and Carl was seeking a building maintenance job similar to the work he was doing at the Kipnuk Clinic. Regina Therachik, manager of Calista’s workforce shareholder development program, counseled them in Yup’ik.
Anchorage was not their first choice for a relocation spot, Stephanie Anaver said. “I wanted to stay in Bethel. But since Bethel was full, they brought us here,” she said in a brief interview.
Rather than staying in Anchorage, the couple has made a temporary home in Wasilla with a family member, she said.
The time in Southcentral Alaska is shaping up to be a period of limbo for the couple. Exactly when the couple will return to Kipnuk, or even if that is possible, is unknown, Stephanie said.
“If they relocate Kipunk to higher ground, yeah, I’ll go back to Kipnuk,” she said.

In the latest battle between Democrats and President Donald Trump, the fate of the state’s Proposition 50 will be decided today.
Californians who haven’t already submitted their ballots are heading to the polls to either approve or reject Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts in a way that favors Democrats through 2030. More than 6.6 million ballots have been cast as of Sunday.
As CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller explains, opponents of the measure argue that sidestepping California’s independent redistricting commission is undemocratic and limits Republican voices. Proponents, meanwhile, have been pushing an anti-Trump message focused on countering gerrymandering efforts in other GOP-controlled states, and potentially winning back the U.S. House of Representatives in next year’s midterm elections.
That rhetoric appears to be working: The Public Policy Institute of California found that 56% of likely voters said they would support the measure, compared to 43% who oppose it. Reporting on a wider gap, the Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies found that 60% of likely voters said they’d vote to pass Prop. 50, versus 38% who’d oppose.

Eric Schickler, co-director of IGS: “The results suggest that Democrats have succeeded in framing the debate surrounding the proposition around support or opposition to President Trump and national Republicans, rather than about voters’ more general preference for nonpartisan redistricting.”

If Prop. 50 passes, it could serve as momentum for other Democratic-leaning states that are considering redistricting. But the party would still face challenges to regain the House through gerrymandering, including tight deadlines and legal disputes.

Tiny creatures poised to create big problems for CA agriculture

A year after golden mussels were first detected in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, these thimble-sized, invasive mollusks continue to spread — threatening critical infrastructure and farmers in the Delta, writes CalMatters’ Rachel Becker.
Native to China and Southeast Asia, golden mussels can attach themselves to underwater surfaces, clog pipes — like they already have done in Contra Costa County’s water systems — and damage infrastructure. But to stop their spread, state agencies have prioritized protecting the rest of the state from the Delta in lieu of protecting the Delta itself, argue residents and local leaders.
California lawmakers earmarked $20 million in funds this year to fight off the mussels’ invasion statewide, but none of that money was allocated to help the Delta, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.
Because the region produces more than $4.6 billion in agricultural output, farming could be especially affected, said Christopher Neudeck, a district engineer for many of the Delta islands. 

Neudeck: “If (the siphons) plug up, we’re going to lose billions of dollars worth of agricultural production. We know it’s become extremely problematic. But nothing has really been done. We’re just in a holding pattern, waiting to let the second shoe drop.”

Conservative values tour set to finish in Berkeley

Turning Point USA plans to make its final tour stop at UC Berkeley on Nov. 10, raising concerns about campus safety among supporters and critics of the organization alike, report Ella Carter-Klauschie and Martin Romero of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network.
Turning Point USA is a nonprofit that promotes conservative values on college campuses. Its co-founder, Charlie Kirk, was fatally shot in September during a tour stop at a Utah university, reigniting debates about political violence and free speech. 
After a brief pause, the tour has since stopped at nine college campuses across the U.S. Its last stop will be at UC Berkeley, an acclaimed public university known for its progressive student activism. It will also be the organization’s first event at a California college campus since Kirk’s death.
Dan Mogulof, a UC Berkeley spokesperson, said the Berkeley chapter expected 300 attendees as of Oct. 14. The venue where the event is being held can hold nearly 2,000. Mogulof declined to provide details on how UC Berkeley plans to secure the event, but said the university will be following protocols set by the major events policy.

(Nevada Health Link video screengrab)This year’s Obamacare open enrollment period, which started Nov. 1 in most states, is full of uncertainty and confusion for the more than 24 million people who buy health insurance through the federal and  state Affordable Care Act marketplaces, including the approximately 110,000 Nevadans who get their health insurance through Nevada Health Link.
Even with sign-up season underway, the fate of the enhanced premium tax credits that make coverage more affordable for 92% of enrollees remains up in the air, with the prospect of significantly higher premiums looming.
But there are steps marketplace shoppers can take to ensure they make the right choices for the upcoming plan year.
1. Understand How We Got Here
In 2021, as part of a covid-era relief package, the ACA premium tax credits were enhanced to lower costs for previously eligible people and expand eligibility to people with incomes over 400% of the federal poverty level (which amounts to about $63,000 for one person in 2025). But those enhancements, which were extended in 2022, will expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress acts.
The debate over whether to extend them again has been at the center of a political battle of wills between Republicans and Democrats in Congress, a fight at the heart of the now month-old government shutdown.
The financial implications for many marketplace enrollees are huge. Average out-of-pocket premium payments for subsidized enrollees are projected to more than double if the enhanced tax credits expire, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
“The longer this goes on, the more damage is done,” said Cynthia Cox, a vice president and the director of the Program on the ACA at KFF. “If someone logs on Nov. 1 and sees their premium doubling, they might just walk away.”
That would be a mistake, marketplace experts agree. What is clear, though, is that buyers need to beware and be informed.
2. Follow the News
It can be frustrating to track day-to-day Capitol Hill machinations. But that may be your best source for up-to-date information. Congress could make a deal to extend the enhanced subsidies anytime during the next few days, weeks, or months — or not. Either way, it could affect your enrollment decision. So, pay attention.
Don’t count on the marketplace or your insurer to notify you about what you should expect to pay. “Many state marketplaces have hit delay” on sending consumers notices of net premiums, which take premium tax credits into account, said Sabrina Corlette, a co-director of Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.
The federal government doesn’t send enrollees notices about plan premiums for the coming year for the 28 federally facilitated marketplaces. For 2026, it has said that health plans can also opt not to.
3. Update Your Account Information
Log in to your marketplace account and update your income, household size, and any other details that have changed.
This year, it’s particularly important to provide an accurate estimate of your anticipated income for 2026.
A provision in HR 1, sometimes called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, eliminated the caps on what many people were required to repay if they underestimated their projected income and received more premium assistance than they should have. Next year, people will have to repay the entire excess amount.
In the past few years, it’s been possible to put your ACA insurance “on autopilot,” with automatic reenrollment in your current or a similar plan. Given the uncertainty around premiums, this is not a good year to do that, enrollment specialists say.
This is especially true for people who, without a deal in Congress, will no longer qualify for subsidies next year, specifically those whose incomes are over 400% of the federal poverty level.
4. Shop Based on Sticker Prices
When people see their projected premiums, assuming Congress hasn’t reached a deal to extend the enhanced credits, many will be shocked.
Health insurance premiums on the marketplaces are expected to increase, on average, 26% next year, according to KFF. That’s the largest rate increase since 2018.
Until now, people have largely been shielded from those increases by the enhanced premium tax subsidies that nearly all enrollees receive. Here’s how it works: Most people with ACA marketplace plans are responsible for paying a portion of their premium based on a sliding income scale, and the government pays the rest.
According to an analysis by KFF, if the enhanced credits are not renewed, a family of four with $75,000 in income, for example, will be responsible for paying $5,865 in annual premiums for a benchmark silver plan in 2026 — more than double the $2,498 it’ll pay if they are renewed.
When evaluating a plan, focus on the listed price. If it’s not affordable without the enhanced tax credits, it’s not a good buy.
“People need to make a decision based on what is in front of them,” Cox said.
If you can’t afford the sticker price without the enhanced credits, consider enrolling in a less generous plan with a lower premium but a higher deductible, Cox said. Bronze plans must provide comprehensive coverage, including covering preventive care at no cost, and may cover some doctor visits before the deductible.
“In most cases, it makes more sense to have a bronze plan than to be uninsured,” she said.
The Trump administration has been promoting catastrophic plans as a more affordable option for people who face financial hardship, including those who don’t qualify for subsidies because their incomes are either less than 100% or more than 400% of the federal poverty level.
Similar to bronze plans, catastrophic plans cover a set of essential health benefits, provide free preventive care, and must cover at least three doctor visits before people reach their deductible. But catastrophic plan deductibles are the highest of any type of marketplace plan: $10,600 for individuals and $21,200 for families in 2026.
“They are expensive relative to what they cover,” said Jennifer Sullivan, director of health coverage access at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, noting premiums can cost several hundred dollars.
5. Come Back, Check, and Recheck
If you’re dismayed at premium prices on your first pass, “don’t slam the computer shut and decide that there are no options for you,” Sullivan said. “Congress might still act and things might change radically.”
Lawmakers could restore the enhanced premium tax credits right up to the end of the year, or later.
In a majority of states, including the 28 that use the federal government’s centralized marketplace, open enrollment lasts until Jan. 15. There are also other key dates to remember.
In most states, people must enroll by Dec. 15 for coverage starting Jan. 1, and by Jan. 15 for coverage starting Feb. 1, though some states have later deadlines.
6. Wait To Pay Your Premium
Premium payments are generally due before the plan takes effect, although marketplaces and insurers have flexibility to extend deadlines, Corlette said.
They might allow people extra time to make a first payment, for example. “We’ve seen that in the past. State officials and insurance companies have gotten creative to try and keep people in coverage,” she said.
But if there is a last-minute deal and someone has already paid their premium for January coverage and received a lower tax credit than the deal provides, they should still be able to receive the higher credit.
“There are ways to make people whole,” Corlette said, although how that might happen this enrollment period is unclear.

(Getty Images)The Indiana Youth Institute announced a statewide effort Tuesday to increase support for children, aiming to ensure each Hoosier child has at least five supportive adults in their lives by 2050.
The announcement came during the 2025 “KIDS COUNT Conference” in downtown Indianapolis, which annually brings together teachers, mentors, counselors and other youth-serving professionals. 
The initiative, called “FIVE by 50,” seeks to connect children with multiple adults who can provide guidance, mentorship and encouragement.
“Strong connections do not just happen. They grow through intention, accountability, and teamwork,” said Tami Silverman, president and CEO of the Indiana Youth Institute, an Indianapolis-based nonprofit that provides training and other resources for youth-serving organizations around the state to improve Hoosier children’s wellbeing. “FIVE by 50 focuses on building up the support systems around kids, so every young person in Indiana has trusted adults who cheer them on, open doors, and help them pursue their own best future.”
IYI officials pointed to research showing that children with multiple supportive adults tend to have better attendance, stronger mental health and higher academic success. 
Silverman said the initiative is designed to bring together schools, after-school programs, community organizations and other youth-serving programs to create a network of support across the state.
Most Indiana kids who need after-school programs can’t access them, new report finds

A national 2024 analysis found that youth engaged in formal mentoring programs reported significantly fewer behavioral problems and fewer symptoms of depression and social anxiety compared with those without mentors.
The reported published by MENTOR, a national nonprofit that advocates and provides resources for mentoring, showed that youth with a mentor are 92% more likely to volunteer regularly in their communities; 75% more likely to have held a leadership position in a club or sports team; and 22% more likely to have experienced a strong sense of belonging while growing up.
Adults who were mentored as youth reported that their mentor contributed significantly to their success later in life. A majority additionally said that mentoring relationships helped with education-related issues and supported their mental health.
Studies cited by MENTOR Indiana, the national organization’s state affiliate, indicate that structured, long-term mentoring programs with trained mentors — like Big Brothers Big Sisters and College Mentors for Kids — can help young people regulate emotions, improve self-esteem, develop social skills and strengthen attitudes toward learning.
Despite those benefits, though, roughly one in three young people in the United States grows up without a mentor outside their family. The gap effects an estimated 9 million youth nationwide.
At the same time, a recent survey found that in Indiana, only about 83,820 children were enrolled in after‑school programs — despite the fact that nearly half a million families indicated they would like access for their children. Cost, transportation and limited availability were cited as major barriers. Such programs are cited by mentorship advocates as sources of mentorship for school-aged kids.

Miller and Jeanne Kuang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/11/proposition-50-newsom-election-day/,Tuesday is the final day for California voters to weigh in on whether to approve Newsom’s plan to redistrict congressional lines to favor Democrats.,"In summary
Tuesday is the final day for California voters to weigh in on whether to approve Newsom’s plan to redistrict congressional lines to favor Democrats. 


California voters are deciding the fate of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Proposition 50, which poses one simple question: to gerrymander or not to gerrymander?
Tuesday’s ballot measure asks voters to approve Newsom’s plan to temporarily sideline California’s independent redistricting commission and instead adopt gerrymandered districts drawn to give Democrats an edge in the national race to control the U.S. House of Representatives. Polls close at 8 p.m.
Newsom and his allies say Prop. 50 offsets gerrymandering efforts in Republican-controlled states such as Texas, Missouri and North Carolina that are designed to help the GOP retain control of Congress and pass more of President Donald Trump’s agenda in his last two years. 
Opponents of Prop. 50 argue that the measure amounts to a power grab by Newsom and Sacramento’s political elite, and that politicians shouldn’t be able to draw their own district lines.
More than 5.9 million ballots — about 26% of those who received mail-in ballots — have already been returned, according to Political Data Inc., which tracks ballots in each county. Final polling shows strong support for Prop. 50, with 56% of likely voters telling the Public Policy Institute of California they’re in favor, and 60% of likely voters supporting in a Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies survey. 
Under the new maps, some disparate parts of the state get lumped together, such as a wacky shaped district in the North State that combines rural and conservative Modoc County with the ultra-liberal Bay Area in Marin County. The city of Huntington Beach, a conservative stronghold in Orange County that banned the LGBTQ pride flag on city property, would be represented by a progressive, gay Peruvian immigrant, the top Democrat on the U.S. House’s primary investigative committee. 
And a game of musical chairs in San Diego and Riverside counties could pit longtime Republican members of Congress against one another as the number of winnable GOP seats shrinks. Several salivating Democrats have already declared they will run in the newly formed, Democratic-friendly 48th Congressional District, which Republican Rep. Darrell Issa currently represents. 
In the weeks leading up to Election Day, voters in the typically low-turnout Central Valley proved that even though many Californians hadn’t heard of Prop. 50 by name, the redistricting issue was familiar enough that they could quickly form an opinion after learning about the measure. 
The Yes side blanketed the airwaves with $55.4 million in ads featuring high-profile Democrats and had a significant fundraising advantage — more than double their opponents. The No campaign spent just $8.9 million in broadcast and video advertising, according to the ad tracking AdImpact.
Voters in five California counties — Fresno, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside — could encounter federal election monitors from the Department of Justice at their polling places. Newsom also fanned fears within the Latino community that immigration agents could appear at polling sites. An ICE spokesperson told CalMatters that the agency was not planning “targeted enforcement actions” at polling sites.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/110524_Election-Oakland_FM_CM_20.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-04 08:56:20.971366

Bernadette Reyes
Bernadette Reyes is a senior staff attorney for the UCLA Voting Rights Project and has authored amicus briefs to the U.S. Supreme Court about the Voting Rights Act.


Sonni Waknin
Sonni Waknin is Senior Staff Attorney for the UCLA Voting Rights Project and has authored amicus briefs to the U.S. Supreme Court about the Voting Rights Act. 


Last summer, the U.S. Supreme Court made a shocking move: it declined to rule on Louisiana v. Callais, a fully briefed, fully argued case challenging Louisiana’s congressional map.
A group of white voters in the case are challenging the legality of the state’s map, after it was redrawn to remedy racially discriminatory districting that had the effect of diluting Black voters. 
Instead of ruling on questions the case originally presented, the court decided to rehear the case, and it issued a new question that it wants the parties to answer: What is the constitutionality of considering race when drawing a map to remedy a violation of the Voting Rights Act? 
Proposing a race-blind remedy to solve racial discrimination is like offering salt water to someone who is dying of thirst. The court, however, seems willing to entertain such a thing — or worse, to sunset the Voting Rights Act, which would leave minority voters out in the cold. 
Predicting what the court will decide is futile. But recent comments from several justices suggest significant changes could be imminent to one of the nation’s strongest voting rights protections. 
The Voting Rights Act, passed in 1965, prohibits redistricting plans that have the effect or intent of preventing any racial, ethnic or language minority group from being able to elect candidates of their choice. The act has had an impact on California’s elections.
For example, in the Garza v. County of Los Angeles case, a federal court in 1990 found that the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors’ map split the County’s Latino community among multiple districts and violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.
As a remedy, Los Angeles County created the first Latino-majority Board of Supervisors district, resulting in the election of Gloria Molina. The remedy — drawing a new redistricting plan that allows for a minority group to be a majority in a district and to elect the candidates of their choice — is central to the Voting Rights Act. 
That system of remedies under the Voting Rights Act is the focus of the Callais case. Section 2 of the Act is the biggest protector of Black electoral power in the nation. Defenders of the Act argued recently that the only Black members of Congress elected in Louisiana were elected in districts drawn after successful Voting Rights Act litigation. 
The return of Jim Crow 
And as attacks on the citizen and non-citizen population of Latinos in the country reach an all-time high, provisions of the Act may be one of the few federal protections for Latino voters.
Absent these protections, there is little to stop the redistricting practices of the Jim Crow era from resurging. We know this will happen because after 2013, when the Supreme Court neutered another part of the Voting Rights Act, Section 5, we observed a resurgence of discriminatory voting practices. 
This time, however, the racial intentions will be in the form of purported partisan maps that allegedly coincidentally dismantle racial minority districts. Our extensive experience with these cases is that all too often the motivations behind redistricting plans are at least as much racial as political.
This summer, we witnessed Texas redistricting in response to a letter from the U.S. Department of Justice, which targeted specific districts based on their racial composition and directed the state to redraw districts that are considered “coalition districts” —  where racial and ethnic minority groups combined to become the majority of voters in a district. 
Texas complied. It intentionally packed and cracked Black and Latino citizens into fewer districts and diluted other areas with large minority populations by merging them with predominantly Anglo, rural areas. 
The resulting maps plainly have a discriminatory intent and effect. Congress has said, over and over again, that such intent and effects must be remedied under the 15th Amendment. Whatever the partisan motivations, reasonable representation for racial minorities was a hard-fought remedy Congress adopted. The Supreme Court should not grant itself the power to repeal this Congressional enactment backed by the 15th Amendment. 
Will any of this affect California Democrats’ attempts to gerrymander congressional districts to create the potential for more Democratic seats in Congress?
While California may also redistrict based on the results of Proposition 50, the current redistricting frenzy around the country will likely not be impacted by Callais for at least the 2026 midterm elections. 
This is a timing issue. The Supreme Court is not likely to issue an opinion in Callais until next June. By then nearly every map will be final for 2026, and primary elections will be under way.
Even if the Supreme Court ruled earlier in the Texas case, it would not affect California’s efforts because the claims at issue in the Texas trial are intentional discrimination claims that exist under the Constitution. 
Safeguarding an inclusive democracy
Indeed, there is no scenario where Prop 50 does not make an impact during the midterm elections. 
Despite attempts to characterize the Voting Rights Act as a partisan law, its loss would devastate the ability of Black, Latino, AAPI, and Native American voters to elect candidates of their choice. It is impossible to know how that would play out on a partisan basis.
While states like Texas move backward, California has the opportunity and the obligation to lead. Voters here will decide on a new redistricting plan, but the state can and should go further. 
By codifying key provisions of the Voting Rights Act into state law, strengthening protections against voter suppression and dilution, and modernizing election infrastructure, California can safeguard the inclusive democracy that other states are working to erode. 
The Supreme Court’s decision in Callais will determine the future of federal voting rights, but California need not wait to defend them.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/110524_ELECTION-FRESNO-COUNTY-LV_CM_08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-04 08:56:20.971366

Spencer Cox’s pick to become the new Utah Supreme Court justice cleared a hurdle Monday when a Senate panel recommended his confirmation. But not before he faced questions about his past role defending conservative actors in highly political legal cases, including abortion and transgender student sports participation.
The Senate Judicial Committee voted 5-2, along party lines, to recommend 3rd District Judge John Nielsen be considered for the justiceship. Democratic senators Stephanie Pitcher of Salt Lake City and Karen Kwan of Taylorsville, who cast negative votes, raised concerns about Nielsen’s background. Especially, Pitcher said, in a complex political climate.
Nielsen’s confirmation now goes to the full Senate for consideration.

“My biggest concern is that this judge has found himself on one side of some very, very political questions that have been litigated,” Pitcher said during the hearing. “And while I appreciate the former commentary, that a good attorney can take both sides of an issue, that doesn’t appear to have been the case.”
Cox appointed Nielsen as a replacement for outgoing Associate Chief Justice John Pearce in October. Before Nielsen started his current role as a judge a little less than a year ago, he worked in both public and private ventures, including a stint as shareholder in a firm alongside former Utah Associate Chief Justice Thomas Lee, Sen. Mike Lee’s brother. 
Cox appoints ‘originalist’ Judge John Nielsen to Utah Supreme Court

During a first hearing with the same committee last Thursday, Nielsen faced questions about what would constitute “judicial activism” from Republican lawmakers, a phrase some of them have used when speaking about recent Utah Supreme Court decisions that have dismayed party leaders — like an opinion favoring plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging the Legislature’s 2021 redistricting process, and a ruling upholding a district court decision to block a near-total ban of abortions in the state while it is adjudicated.
That’s a role that Nielsen said he isn’t interested in taking. 
“Keep me in my lane, and keep me doing the work of a judge rather than the work of the Legislature,” Nielsen said. 
But, during the questioning last week, Democrats were more interested in the clients he had represented in his private practice in high-profile litigation.
“Because you’ve been involved with so many cases that are inherently political,” Pitcher asked, “how will you ensure that litigants and the public can have confidence that you’ll be an objective, neutral, fact finder or arbiter?”



Let us know what you think...


 


After mentioning that former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer before her appointment, sat in many First Amendment cases, making the court “better for it” with her expertise, Nielsen said the bench is populated with many former prosecutors and defense attorneys with no question that they can perform their duties.
“In fact, that’s a lot of value that they add is being able to sit on those cases because of the experience that they have,” he said. “So how would I do it? I would do as I have done in my current job, and as I pledged to do when I took this current job, which is to be fair and impartial to all who appear before me.”
On Thursday, when asked whether he would recuse himself from the abortion ban challenge, in which he participated in Pro-life Utah’s representation, and the redistricting case, where one of his clients was the Republican Party, both of which may appear in front of the court in the future, Nielsen said that he couldn’t commit to taking a particular action during his confirmation process for ethical reasons.
“But I can promise that I will follow the established rules for recusal,” he said.

“You can just push your way right through them,” said Wingfield from the dock where he stood at the Port of Stockton, looking down at the thimble-sized debris in his palm. 
Last October, a couple of miles down the Stockton Deepwater Shipping Channel, state water managers first discovered that golden mussels had invaded North America. 
Seeing how fast they’ve multiplied in the last year “was like a gut punch,” said Wingfield, a deputy director at the port. 
The mussels are infamous for voracious appetites that fuel their rapid growth. Now, state and local water managers are battling to keep golden mussels from reaching uninfested lakes and reservoirs. They’re racing to keep them from damaging the pumping facilities that send Delta water to farms and cities in Central and Southern California. 
But here, in the web of waterways where the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers meet, a new reality is setting in. Thick colonies of the mussels already coat boats and piers and threaten water supplies for cities and farms. 
In the urgency to  stop the spread, state agencies have prioritized protecting the rest of the state from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, over protecting the Delta itself. Residents and local leaders feel overlooked. And they fear that the stigma of a golden mussel infestation will drive visitors and boaters away from one of the country’s largest estuaries. 
“That’s almost like bringing bedbugs or something back from a trip overseas,” Wingfield said. “If you’ve been in the Delta now, it’s like you’ve been exposed.”

The economic consequences are looming large. Invasive mussel and clam species cost an  estimated $1.6 billion every year, largely in North America — costs overwhelmingly counted in damage to business and infrastructure, rather than management or prevention. 
“We’re just getting started,” said Ted Grosholz, a professor emeritus with the UC Davis Coastal and Marine Sciences Institute. “As the populations grow, the problems will grow.”
A Delta scourge, one year in
The Delta is home to nearly three quarters of a million people, half a million acres of farmland, threatened and endangered fish species — and now, the golden mussel. 
Native to China and Southeast Asia, the mussel is suspected to have slipped in on a commercial ship, past long-delayed shipping rules aimed at keeping out invaders.
Now, the abundant mollusk is invading critical infrastructure. 
The Contra Costa Water District reports golden mussels in multiple parts of its system. And in Stockton, the heart of the invasion, the municipal utilities department found golden mussels on an oil containment boom near their intakes. 
Travis Small, deputy director of water resources at the department, said he’s concerned about the raw water pipeline that transports Delta water to their treatment plant, and plans to hire a diver to inspect the utility’s fish screens and pump well. He calls the rapid spread “worrisome.” 
The mussels have even started appearing on irrigation siphons that pipe Delta water onto farmland. Though the San Joaquin County Farm Bureau and Delta irrigation districts haven’t reported clogged pipes, yet, Keith Lyons, a diver who inspects underwater equipment, said that he’s already seeing the mussels on them.
One siphon, he said, was so thickly encrusted that the mussels piled two inches deep, both inside and out. 
“There’s a lot. A heck of a lot,” Lyons said. “I’m worried for the farmers. There’s no quick answer. There’s no Roundup.”

Dennis Pelucca, a pest control advisor, also spotted mussels on the siphons for Rindge Tract, an island west of Stockton, to irrigate crops. 
So many mussels were hanging off the outside of the pipe, it looked like a beard, he said. On the inside, “if it gets to the point like arteries getting clogged up with cholesterol, then that’s what you’re going to be dealing with. It will plug them up.” 
The consequences could be devastating for farming, said Christopher Neudeck, president of the civil engineering firm Kjeldsen, Sinnock & Neudeck and a district engineer for many of the Delta islands. The region produces dozens of different crops, and drives more than $4.6 billion in agricultural output. 
“If (the siphons) plug up, we’re going to lose billions of dollars worth of agricultural production,” Neudeck said. “We know it’s become extremely problematic. But nothing has really been done. We’re just in a holding pattern, waiting to let the second shoe drop.”
Wingfield, too, has been grappling with the invasive mussels at the Port of Stockton for the past year. He’s worried they could clog intakes for vital water systems, including an aerator that maintains legally required oxygen levels in the shipping channel. 
Standing on the dock, Wingfield’s colleague Steven Bender hauled sampling plates from the water, deployed to help staff track the invasion. 
The bottom had been stripped clean of mussels at the end of the summer, but by October was again completely encrusted. Mussels grew on top of mussels. 
Bender ripped a handful away from the plates, with a sound like velcro tearing. 
No help arriving
For all the emerging and anticipated consequences of the invasion, the state has no specific funding or plans to tackle harms in the Delta. 
California lawmakers allocated $20 million in Proposition 4 funds this year to fight off golden and other invasive mussels statewide. But according to the Department of Fish and Wildlife, none of it is set aside to protect the Delta or help it adapt. 
Other pots of money, like the department’s Boating Access Grant Program, could in theory help fund eligible projects to combat the golden mussel in the Delta, but they aren’t specifically designated for that purpose.  
Assemblymember Rhodesia Ransom, a Democrat from Stockton, called the $20 million an initial investment and said the legislature’s Delta Caucus is looking at what more its members can do. She called for federal help. 
“These things came clearly from another region, another country — and that means all of our waterways are at risk,” Ransom said, calling the mussels a “serious emerging threat” to farms, water supplies, and recreation.

But Rep. Josh Harder’s federal legislation aimed at combating the invasion in the Delta has stalled. 
“It’s tough to get bills from California passed in this Congress,” said Harder, the Democrat representing San Joaquin and parts of Stanislaus and Contra Costa counties who introduced the bill. “This shouldn’t be a partisan issue.”
As Gov. Gavin Newsom pushes for a $20 billion tunnel to send more Delta water to farms and cities in Central and Southern California, the mussel adds to residents’ growing sense that the Delta is under siege — seen more as a conduit for water than as a place with its own vibrant ecosystems, cultures and farms to protect. 
“We do feel abandoned,” said Brett Baker, a water lawyer and sixth-generation farmer in the region. “If you were expecting help from the state, you’d be foolish — because at the same time this is happening, they’re proceeding through with the (tunnel) proceedings to basically eviscerate the Delta.” 
A silver bullet? 
In the absence of state or federal help, some still hold out hope that something, someday might eradicate the mussels from the Delta. 
A few miles away from the Port, at the Delta Marine Yacht Center boatyard, Bob Parsons peered at the dripping undercarriage of the work barge he’d hauled from the water. 
Back in March, he’d covered each pontoon with a different type of paint — an experiment to see which was better at preventing the buildup of aquatic hangers-on, like algae. Tiny shells jutted from both pontoons seven months later. 
“This is such a small amount in comparison to what I’ve been seeing,” Parsons said.

Parsons is hoping for a silver bullet, but scientists agree that one isn’t coming. The invasion is already too established, and the Delta too complex. 
Still, he like many others, has pinned at least some of his hopes on a compound being developed by the Invasive Species Corporation, a Davis-based start-up founded by scientist and entrepreneur Pamela Marrone.  
The product, Zequanox, is already used to combat other invasive mussels, like the species that have taken hold in the Great Lakes and parts of Southern California. Marrone’s team is optimizing it for the golden mussel, as well. 
Marrone cautions that controlling mussels in pipes, the inner workings of boats and other water infrastructure is doable. But eliminating mussels from the Delta “is not likely feasible or cost effective.”
Without a Delta-wide fix, boaters are grasping for anything they can get their hands on — like special paints, or using ultrasonic sound waves to make their vessels inhospitable to the invaders. 
In the meantime, Parson’s team is ripping hundreds of pounds off their hulls. And a sense of futility is creeping across waterfronts and docks. 
A community at stake
On a warm evening in October, 85-year-old Gene Beley walked down J dock at the Village West Marina and Resort in Stockton. A great egret followed, picking its way down the walkway in the slanting light, looking for dinner. 
J dock has become Beley’s community in the year since his wife passed away. “These are all my neighbors,” Beley said, passing the other boats belonging to a bartender, a contractor, a tech executive. “A lot of times, like Friday or Saturday nights, you’ll see a group right here, solving the world’s problems.”

His friend of 20 years, 75-year-old boat mechanic Fred Vijsma, keeps his yacht just a couple of slips down. Golden mussels clog the thruster and decorate the underside of his dinghies. 
Vijsma has been waging a private war against the tiny invaders. He keeps the mussels he’s scraped off his dinghy in a coffee can, and kills them with salt — an act part science, part vengeance. The smell of the dead mussels, even in the open air, was overpowering. And his worry about how the mussels will harm this region, and his friends, was palpable. 
“In just the short period of time that we’ve had these mussels, it’s totally devastating,” Vijsma said. “What do we do? How do we fix this? We don’t want to leave our boats.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/102325_Golden_Mussel_FG_CM_11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-04 08:17:40.878789
,California,2025-11-04 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Prop 50 is likely a stepping stone for Newsom’s nascent presidential campaign,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/11/proposition-50-newsom-presidential-campaign/,"Gov. Gavin Newsom told an NBC reporter he's not ready to talk about a presidential run, even though a Prop. 50 win could burnish his national image.","The odds are astronomically high that California voters will ratify Proposition 50, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s scheme to grab five more congressional seats for his Democratic Party.
However, passage may have little or no impact on next year’s congressional elections since it merely offsets the five-seat grab that Texas Republicans enacted earlier at President Donald Trump’s behest.
What happens vis-à-vis redistricting in other states, particularly those controlled by Republicans, is more likely to determine the 2026 election’s parameters by either enhancing or reducing Republican chances of maintaining their very slim House majority.
That said, Newsom’s audacious confrontation of Trump is a major step toward capturing his party’s presidential nomination in 2028 — a prize he still insists, with rapidly decreasing credibility, he has not decided to pursue.
By framing Prop. 50 as a tool to block Trump’s authoritarian tendencies, Newsom emerges as the de facto leader of a political party that is trying to find a way forward after last year’s embarrassing loss. Moreover, his extensive fundraising for the Prop. 50 campaign gives him a list of thousands of potential supporters for a presidential campaign.
“I haven’t decided,” Newsom insisted to Kristen Welker on NBC’s Meet the Press, which aired Sunday, before emitting a word salad of criteria for a 2028 candidate that seemed to embrace himself, to wit:
“I think whoever runs, and this is just my objective belief, subjective, but I hope it’s objective for a lot of Americans, it reminds me a little of Isaiah. You need to be a repairer of the breach, spiritually and physically. But it’s not just about restoration, the forces of restoration. It’s also forces of transformation. And what I mean by that is what are the trend lines that define the future? You know, I’m here. We’re in the future business. I’m here in California. Future happens here first. We’re America’s coming attraction…
“I worry about the future of work,” Newsom continued. “I worry about the announcement from Amazon. I worry about earnings going up, profits skyrocketing, and headcount going down, meaning less and less people having access and opportunities. I think whoever runs has to paint a vision for the future, a journey that we can be on together that’s not just about growth but about inclusion, issues of debt and entitlement, issues around energy. And I still believe in climate issues. All those issues need to be front and center eventually for whoever’s the nominee of our party.”
So if one makes the completely logical assumption that Newsom is conducting a shadow campaign, despite his insistence to the contrary, how does he build on the Prop. 50 campaign that portrayed Trump as the devil incarnate and himself as the resistor in chief?
During his Meet the Press interview, Newsom hinted that he will continue to troll Trump on social media and engage in other unconventional maneuvers to bolster opposition, because Trump has used those tools himself.
“The rules of the game have changed,” Newsom told Welker. “Now, we have to rewrite the new rules. I’m trying to iterate. I’m in that process of doing that.” His tactics, Newsom implied, are justified by Trump’s authoritarianism.
“This can’t continue forever, all of us living in this state of fear and anxiety, on edge,” he said. “And so of course we want to go back to some semblance of normalcy. But you have to deal with the crisis at hand. It’s just been 10, 11 months of this presidency. We have three more years. Time to batten down the hatches. And it’s time for us to change if we want things to change. And that’s why our communications strategy has shifted.”
It sure sounds like Newsom wants to be the catalyst for that change.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/110325-Newsom-Prop-50-DS-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-04 08:17:40.878789

(Webinar screengrab)A bipartisan duo of state lawmakers hosted a webinar Monday to cast doubt on the merits of passing what would be the state’s largest public subsidy in history, a transferable tax credit plan that supporters hope to enact in an upcoming special session of the Nevada Legislature.  
At the virtual forum Monday, Republican Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus and Democratic Assemblymember Natha Anderson said there are scant details about the proposal they are expected to vote on later this month. 
A proposed bill would likely mirror failed legislation from the regular legislative session earlier this year that sought to allocate $1.4 billion in transferable tax credits over 15 years to support a studio in Las Vegas.
The legislation passed the Assembly by a razor-thin margin with 22 in support and 20 opposed. Lawmakers ran out of time and the bill never received a vote in the Senate. 
“My members are saying, ‘Listen, I can’t give you an absolute until we see what’s in that bill,” Titus said, referring to the head count regarding which of her Senate Republican colleagues support the bill. “Right now, all this is speculation.”

 


How the film tax credit program works
 
Production companies can apply with the Nevada Film Office to receive transferable film tax credits equaling a certain percentage of qualified expenses.
The companies sell the credits to other Nevada companies at less than face value, though the state accepts them as payment at full face value.
The procedure provides a financial subsidy to the tax credit recipients (the tv or film production company), and a tax break to the tax credit purchasers (typically gaming or insurance companies).
The state incurs “negative revenue” — tax revenue that would otherwise fund services and programs is never received by the state.
 




Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has vowed to call a special session. The details have been limited on the scope of what could be included, but supporters and opponents alike expect Lombardo to include the film tax credit bill sponsored by Democratic Assemblymembers Sandra Jauregui and Danielle Monroe Moreno in a special session agenda. Under the state constitution, when a governor calls a special session, they are allowed to determine what issues can and can’t be addressed by legislators.
Nevada’s film tax credit program is currently capped at $10 million per year. Jauregui and Monroe Moreno’s bill sought to raise that cap to $95 million per year, for 15 years, beginning in 2028. Hollywood giants Sony Pictures Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery is backing the measure, along with  Howard Hughes Holdings, which would develop the site.
Titus, who declared her opposition to the proposal last month, even as the Republican governor has indicated he supports it, underscored during the virtual form Monday that the money for the program would be taken from state revenue “that would otherwise go to schools, and healthcare.”
In what resembled an impromptu unofficial legislative hearing, Titus and Anderson, both Northern Nevada lawmakers, invited Democratic Georgia State Rep. Marvin Lim to the webinar to question him about the economic impact and job creation, or lack thereof, of the film tax credit program approved in Georgia 20 years ago. 
Lim acknowledged the differences between the two states but offered warnings for what lawmakers should look out for if considering allocating tax credits.
He said the film tax credit program has brought some economic benefits, but “it has come at a significant price and it is not sustainable.”
For all the grand gestures and promises by lobbyists to invest in local arts and the state economy, “this industry cares more about money than arts, communities, progressive values,” he said. 
Beyond promises of raw job numbers, Lim encouraged lawmakers to take a deeper look at  “what is the impact on the other parts of the economy?” 
“How does this impact what the future of the industry will be, and how does that get sustained over the long run?” he asked. “If you attract all of these jobs, all of this talent, can this industry sustain itself over the long run?”
The economic advantages of the legislation have been questioned. An independent analysis commissioned by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, which houses the Nevada Film Office, determined that the tax credits would stimulate the state economy but not enough to offset the massive expansion of the film tax credit program.
Lobbyist groups, including a political action committee set up by building trades unions, contend the public subsidy to California film corporations would lead to job growth. 
The unions’ Nevada Jobs Now! PAC recently sent out mailers targeting lawmakers who have voted against the bill for not wanting to bring “more jobs.” The PAC’s ads reference neither the publicly subsidized film tax credit or even the film industry itself.
In Georgia, there were jobs created at the beginning, Lim said. But there hasn’t been any indication, or concrete data, on whether those jobs were sustainable, offered a living wage, led to other opportunities within the industry, or otherwise lived up to the promise made to Georgia lawmakers back in 2005.
All those questions have been met with “a huge, doubtful question mark,” he said. 
In a statement Monday night, issued through the unions’ Nevada Jobs Now PAC, Monroe Moreno said the Georgia bill and Nevada’s proposal “could not be more different.”
Monroe-Moreno, who is also the chair of the Nevada Democratic Party, said the bill she is sponsoring has “performance metrics” that include “requiring 50% of qualified production workforce be from here.”
Lingering questions about whether the industry lived up to its promise haven’t stopped lawmakers in Georgia from voting on extending tax credits, Lim acknowledged. 
Every time a vote comes up, industry backers work to make lawmakers “fear what will be lost” while also making legislators “forget that they didn’t get what was promised to begin with,” he said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bipartisanantiftc-1024x753.png,,,2025-11-04 08:17:40.878789

Wired for Profit: First in a series about Alabama Power’s influence over electric rates, renewable energy, pollution and politics in the Yellowhammer State.
MCCALLA — Mary Rosenboom is fed up.
Like 1.5 million other Alabamians, Rosenboom is forced to pay ever-increasing electricity prices set by Alabama Power and approved by the state’s Public Service Commission. Each month, Rosenboom forks over hundreds of dollars to the utility—and a massive hyperscale data center proposed near her home, she fears, will make the situation even worse.
Her electricity costs are already a huge financial burden. Rosenboom, who works as a sales professional, said she chooses not to run her air conditioner during much of the day to prevent an untenable power bill. Even that isn’t enough. Often, Rosenboom said she must turn to high-interest credit cards to keep the lights on.

“I’m robbing Peter to pay Paul,” she told Inside Climate News. “It makes me sick.”

Rosenboom’s plight isn’t unique.
Inside Climate News examined the 2024 federal filings of 100 of the largest electric utilities in the country.
None reported higher total residential electric bills, on average, than Alabama Power.
Because Alabama is one of the poorest states in the nation, that hits especially hard. Electricity customers here are among the most financially burdened in the nation, the U.S. Department of Energy found. And an analysis by think tank RMI showed that among households with extremely low incomes, Alabamians pay nearly a quarter of their earnings for electricity—the highest percentage in the country.
So why are power bills so high?
Experts point to lax regulation by the Alabama Public Service Commission, which is charged with regulating Alabama Power and overseeing any large spending or rate increases proposed by the utility.
Robert Blanton, chair of the Department of Political Science and Public Administration at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, has been digging into the mechanisms that allow Alabama Power to earn record profits in such an impoverished state.
Ultimately, he said, there’s strong evidence that Alabama Power has effectively “captured” its regulator, the PSC. Academics use the concept of regulatory capture to describe a situation in which regulators are more beholden to the entities they are charged with regulating than the public they represent.
The commission conducts much of its regulation of Alabama Power behind closed doors, with little to no access for the public or outside interest groups. It has consistently granted Alabama Power unusually high profit margins. The company’s return on equity was 11 percent in 2023, according to a utility analysis by financial firm S&P Global.
That’s down slightly from the company’s historical average of around 13 percent, but still among the highest of any utility in the country. Nationwide, the average rate of return approved for electric utilities in 2024 rate cases was 9.74 percent, according to S&P.
“I don’t think there’s a single utility in the country that would be upset with an 11 percent earned ROE,” said Kent Chandler, former chairman of the Kentucky Public Service Commission, now a senior fellow in energy and environmental policy for the R Street Institute. “I mean, that’s like double what I know some utilities are actually earning.”
Meanwhile, Alabama Power and its parent, Southern Co., have boasted about their record profits. “Every quarter for 78 consecutive years, Southern Company has paid a dividend to its shareholders that is equal to or greater than the previous quarter,” the company said in a July press release.
In a statement, representatives for Alabama Power said the company’s rates were fair and its reliability was among the best in the nation. The company pointed to high per capita electricity usage in the state, the seventh-highest in the country, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and the third-highest residential usage. The company said that its residential rate, not the total bill, is a more appropriate way to evaluate the company’s affordability.
“On those price-based measures—paired with our industry-leading reliability—Alabama Power’s residential service is fairly priced under PSC oversight,” the company said.

Alabama Power’s average residential rate last year was 16.77 cents per kilowatt-hour, higher than the national average of 16.48 cents and 35th highest out of 100 utilities examined by Inside Climate News.
But the national average includes places like Hawaii, Connecticut and Southern California, which are all among the top 10 states for median household income. Shipping fuel oil to Hawaii and wildfire prevention in California are also huge costs that don’t apply in Alabama.
Alabama Power’s combination of above-average rates with top-five usage yielded the highest total residential bills in the nation last year. Other states with similar or greater usage feature lower rates. One reason Alabama’s usage is so high: nearly 70 percent of Alabamians use electric heat, as opposed to natural gas, thanks in part to incentives offered by Alabama Power.
Louisiana, which has the highest per capita residential electricity use in the nation, has electric rates that averaged 11.64 cents/kWh in 2024, about 30 percent lower than Alabama Power’s rate. The average Alabama Power residential customer used 1,129 kWh of electricity per month last year, at a cost of about $189. A customer using the same amount of electricity in Louisiana would have paid $58 less every month. Those figures do not include state or local taxes, so the actual bills are even higher.
Average residential rates in the states bordering Alabama—Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida—are 15 to 25 percent lower than Alabama Power’s rates.
Alabama Power’s rates are also well above those of other providers in the state—46 percent higher than the average rate last year charged by Huntsville Utilities, which serves almost 200,000 residential customers in north Alabama.

The R Street Institute, the think tank where Chandler now works, gave Alabama an “F” in its ranking of electricity competition—how much choice consumers have about where their power comes from. No other state received such a bad grade.
The group only considered investor-owned utility companies in its rankings, and Alabama Power is the only such company in Alabama.
Alabama Power also charges about 16 percent more than Mississippi Power and about 8 percent more than Georgia Power, the other two utilities owned by its parent company, Southern Co.
The difference, at least in part, is that Alabama Power’s rates are driven up by the company’s ever-increasing profits.
The company reported a $1.4 billion profit in 2024, almost double the $712 million it earned in 2013, the year the PSC changed its formula for measuring Alabama Power’s profits. The company’s book value—its assets minus debt—more than doubled over that span, going from $5.5 billion to $13 billion.
Alabama Power said the increase in equity is driven by investments made to improve the system. “Growth in book equity primarily mirrors system investment—storm hardening, cyber and physical security, as well as transmission and distribution upgrades, along with other investments driven by reliability and compliance,” the company said.

Almost no public participation

In virtually all states with regulated utilities, rate cases force the company to justify its proposed increases in a public forum, providing sworn, expert testimony and allowing outside groups to challenge the projections and assertions made by the power company. Not in Alabama.
The PSC hasn’t conducted a formal rate case related to Alabama Power since 1982, more than four decades ago.
“There are no courtroom-style hearings on Alabama Power’s long-term energy planning or how those plans impact customers’ bills,” said Christina Tidwell, a senior attorney in the Southern Environmental Law Center’s Alabama office. “These types of proceedings are routine in other states. When the public can participate, we believe they’re better informed about how this process impacts their lives.”

Chandler, the former chairman of the Kentucky Public Service Commission, said that while rate cases can be tedious, they are valuable to the public.
“One of the benefits of having rate cases is that you get a holistic look at a utility’s revenues and a utility’s costs,” Chandler said. “In my experience in Kentucky, consumers benefit from having periodic reviews by an objective regulator.”
And since regulated utilities earn profits on all their approved spending, the more they spend, the more they earn, he said.
“They have an incentive to over-invest,” Chandler said. “And if you never check things after the fact, then you’re just writing them a blank check.”
Wall Street has taken notice. A 2024 report by S&P Global put Alabama in a tier of its own atop the rankings in its State Regulatory Evaluations, examining the likelihood that state regulators might decrease or limit a utility’s profits. The report found no other state where a utility’s profits were as safe as in Alabama.
The last PSC commissioner to advocate for formal rate hearings for Alabama Power—Terry Dunn in 2013—was promptly voted out of office in the next election. Dunn, a self-described conservative Republican, faced a curious and largely anonymous campaign linking him to environmental groups.
Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh, the former PSC president, described Dunn’s efforts to initiate formal reviews of Alabama Power as a “full frontal assault” by “extremist groups” and their “fancy San Francisco environmental lawyers.”
Dunn, who died last year, called the efforts “a smear campaign orchestrated against a Republican by fellow Republicans,” in a letter to the state party in 2013.
Later that year, about 10 people staged what many believe to be a faked environmental protest on the front steps of the PSC building. The protesters, wearing blue surgical masks and other items obscuring their identities, bore signs with slogans such as “Environmentalists [heart] Dunn,” and “Save the Warrior,” likely a reference to the Black Warrior River, which runs through Tuscaloosa. Representatives of environmental groups who were there to attend a meeting said they had no idea who the people were.
Ultimately, Dunn was defeated in the 2014 Republican primary by Chris “Chip” Beeker Jr., a cattle and catfish farm operator and former county commissioner in rural Greene County—a county whose largest employer was an Alabama Power plant. Beeker had help. Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, whose lobbying firm represented Alabama Power’s parent company, organized a fundraiser for Beeker in 2013.
Beeker stepped down from the commission partway through his term last year, citing health issues. His son, Chris Beeker III, filled his seat after being appointed by Gov. Kay Ivey.
The PSC’s new president, Cynthia Lee Almond, has said transparency will be one of her priorities. But PSC staff would not make her or other commissioners available for an interview to discuss the absence of rate hearings or the public’s limited role in PSC affairs. Instead, the PSC’s press office provided written responses to questions.

When reporters reach out to the agency seeking information, the answers come with this warning:
“All verbal and/or written responses provided by the staff of the Alabama Public Service Commission (“APSC”) are for informational purposes only and may not be the subject of quotation(s) attributed to staff in any public medium without the express permission of the APSC.”

A profitable change

A turning point for Alabama Power’s profits came in 2013. That’s the year Alabama state regulators changed the way they measure Alabama Power’s returns, switching from the industry standard return on equity metric to a formula they created, called weighted retail return on common equity.
The weighted return rate rewards Alabama Power for having higher ratios of equity to debt. The idea was that by incentivizing company officials to carry a greater percentage of equity as opposed to debt, they would secure higher credit ratings and be able to borrow money under better terms, decreasing overall costs.
At the time, commissioners and the company said they expected electric rates to go down as a result.
“I will tell you as you see adjustments over the next few years, you are going to see a decrease,” then-PSC President Cavanaugh said.
That didn’t happen.
Instead, the company benefited from the change far more than its customers did.
Alabama Power’s electric rates have risen 45 percent across all customer groups since the novel rate formula went into effect. That’s far more than the national average, which increased 29 percent over the same span.

Meanwhile, the company’s profit nearly doubled, despite producing less electricity today than it did in 2013.
Since Alabama Power earns a return on all of its equity, having more power plants and infrastructure in place increases its profitability. The company also earns bonuses under the rate structure for maintaining positive credit ratings by financial agencies and for having a greater than 50 percent ratio of equity to debt.
The PSC, in a written statement, denied that its switch to weighted common equity was driving Alabama Power’s increased profitability.
“With regard to your analysis of public documents, which reflect the financial position of Alabama Power, please be advised there is no correlation between Alabama Power’s current financial position and the implementation of the weighted retail return on average common equality mechanism in 2013,” a commission representative told Inside Climate News.
Instead, the PSC said the increased net income was the result of Alabama Power’s “significant capital investments to modernize its systems,” which were approved by the PSC.

“If that’s not regulatory capture . . .”

Blanton, the political science professor at UAB, sees the absence of rate-making cases, the nation’s highest electricity rates and Alabama’s record profits as unmistakable signs that Alabama’s PSC has been captured by the company it regulates.
He points to three ways regulatory capture manifests itself in Alabama.
“One is campaign finance, the ability of the regulated industry to financially contribute towards the campaigns of regulatory bodies,” he said.
A 2024 analysis by Floodlight, a nonprofit newsroom, showed that of the states that elect the members of their utility regulator, Alabama tops the list of those receiving the most campaign finance cash from fossil fuel-linked interests.
Fifty-five percent of political donations to Alabama public service commissioners above $250 from 2013 to 2023 came from fossil-fuel interests, the analysis concluded.
“You don’t have to have a conspiratorial mindset to figure out that gives these donors leverage—if they’re the ones that are financing the campaigns of the people they’re supposed to be regulating,” Blanton said of such contributions.

Part of the problem, Blanton said, is that Alabama is one of 10 states that directly elects its utility commissioners. PSC commissioners say they don’t accept money directly from the utilities they regulate, but lax campaign finance laws provide ample opportunity for influencing regulators, Blanton said.
An examination of “information flows” in the state also points toward capture, he said. There’s a general opacity and complexity around the information involved and a relative dominance of the industry as the primary source for information for the regulators, according to Blanton.
The third aspect of regulatory capture is “cultural capture,” Blanton said, a concept that alludes to the extent to which industry and regulators share similar worldviews or perspectives.
“The key is whether or not regulators are likely to unquestioningly accept evidence and opinions put forth by the industry, and the extent to which regulators accept information from outside sources,” Blanton said.
Looking at these three lines of evidence, Blanton said there are some clear takeaways about where Alabama finds itself—captured.
“There’s no objective reason why Alabama should be an outlier. We’re not hotter than Texas. We don’t have worse conditions than Louisiana,” he said. “There’s just nothing that makes sense. … Any reasonable person, looking through the data, looking through the evidence, will say, ‘We have a situation that’s, if that’s not regulatory capture, I don’t know what is.’”

Data center angst

Inside Climate News interviewed more than a dozen Alabama Power customers for this story, and each shared the concerns voiced by Mary Rosenboom, the customer who lives near the proposed hyperscale data center—rising energy costs, a lack of transparency and fear about what the future may hold.

Rosenboom and others worry that construction and operation of power-hungry data centers will drive their electricity costs even higher.
“I know that’s what’s coming,” Rosenboom said. “And it’ll be us that foot the bill. It’s not good for the citizens. It’s good for Alabama Power’s pocketbook.”
Alabama Power and the PSC both insist that data center costs will not be passed on to other customers. But they also declined to say whether those agreements with data centers will be made public, making it impossible to verify those claims.
In a statement, a representative for the company said that it takes a “disciplined approach” to engaging with potential data center customers.
“We understand that budgets are tight, and affordability is central to our mission. That is why we work hard to connect customers with offerings like Budget Billing, payment plans, efficiency tools, and assistance programs,” the company’s response said.
Data centers will “pay the full, fair cost to serve their needs,” the company said. “We work with the Alabama Public Service Commission to approve large-load customer contracts and any needed operational investments, ensuring a thorough process that validates needs and protects customers.”
Alabama Power declined to provide a list of planned data center projects and their anticipated electricity demand.
“Long-term capacity planning is reviewed with the PSC,” the company responded. “We don’t publish speculative load projections for individual customer classes or projects. Any major resource additions follow established processes to ensure reliability and fairness for all customers.”
Regulatory interactions involving Alabama Power and the PSC are often similarly opaque.
During depositions involving Alabama Power’s request to purchase a natural gas plant earlier this year, lawyers for environmental groups questioned company management about data centers and their anticipated loads.
The company’s representatives were often vague in their answers, though they did admit that data centers are the “primary driver” of increased load projections. When company lawyers did provide substantive information about specific load figures, their answers were redacted in PSC transcripts.
“I’ll say that some projects fall off of this list and some projects are added to this list and the net change is [redacted] megawatts,” Alabama Power forecasting manager Maria Burke said in a deposition. “They have a mixed answer because in the previous forecast I would say we only had [redacted] megawatts to data centers and in this forecast we have [redacted]. So the delta is [redacted].”
If built to capacity, a proposed data center campus in Bessemer, just southwest of Birmingham near Rosenboom’s home in McCalla, is expected to consume as much as 1,200 megawatts of electricity, running every hour, 24 hours a day, according to estimates provided to residents. That amount of energy is about 10 times the usage of all residences in nearby Birmingham or around 90 times the usage of all residences in Bessemer.
The site of the proposed Bessemer data center is currently a nearly 700-acre wooded plot. Construction would require the clearcutting of more than 100 acres. (Lee Hedgepeth/Inside Climate News)
In one fell swoop, it could increase Alabama Power’s total demand across the state by around 10 percent.
“My power bill’s already not affordable,” said Brenda Small, who lives in a trailer park adjacent to the site of the proposed data center. “I had one bill that was $495. No one can afford that.”

Reliant on fossil fuels

Alabama Power’s electricity is not only expensive, it’s dirty and comes with a heavy environmental footprint.
The PSC has approved costly upgrades to old coal-fired power plants, allowing Alabama Power to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to delay their retirements by only a few years. The PSC greenlit massive natural gas additions in 2020, 2022 and 2025, making Alabama Power increasingly reliant on fossil fuels for decades to come and its customers vulnerable to price spikes in natural gas and supply shortages in times of heavy energy use.
Its coal-fired power plant near Birmingham, the James H. Miller Jr. Electric Generating Plant, has been the nation’s largest single source of greenhouse gases for nine years running. The company charges hefty fees to customers who install solar panels, smothering the small-scale renewable market. Alabama ranks second to last among states in energy efficiency efforts in a recent scorecard, and upgrades to its old and expensive coal plants seem destined to continue as electricity demand rises due to large data centers.
The company has also stuck to its guns on plans to leave nearly 77 million cubic yards of toxic coal ash in unlined ponds along Alabama’s rivers, leaching contaminants into the groundwater indefinitely, even as other utilities in the South have agreed to dig out some or all of their ash ponds.
And this environmental record, UAB’s Blanton said, has come under the watch of state regulators, who have minimized the effects of climate change and Alabama Power’s pollution.

A new profit formula review — with no public input

When adopting the 2013 profit formula, called Rate Stabilization and Equalization, or RSE, the commission agreed to review its performance every six years. The first review was conducted in 2019, with no changes made to the rate structure.
In its responses to Inside Climate News, the commission said the second review has already begun—with no public input—through a series of closed-door meetings with Alabama Power and the state attorney general’s office.
Whether outside experts or concerned members of the public will be provided an opportunity to weigh in on the review will only be decided after the commission’s staff has made its findings, the PSC statement said.
Tidwell, the Southern Environmental Law Center attorney, said public participation should be essential in utility regulation.
“Alabama Power customers who are impacted by the PSC’s decisions deserve to have a say in the process,” Tidwell said. “The Public Service Commission is tasked with ensuring that rates are just and reasonable not just for Alabama Power, but also for the public. … How can you protect customers’ best interests when there are almost no avenues for them to participate in the process?”

Advocacy groups gathered on the lawn of the Michigan Capitol on Monday afternoon to put together a “Congressional Shamesgiving” art demonstration calling out Michigan’s Congressional Republicans for “siding with billionaires and corporate interests over working families,” a release on the event stated. 
The art display featured two sides of a Thanksgiving table, one with models of pie and turkey and the other with spoiled food, bugs, polluted water and empty pill bottles. It was intended to show the disparities between what the holiday will look like for wealthy Americans compared to working-class families, specifically calling out Republican U.S. Reps. Tom Barrett, John James and Bill Huizenga. 
The demonstration’s art targeted rising health care costs, lapsing federal food assistance benefits, and water and air quality issues. 
“We see that our Congresspeople are taking money hand over fist. They’re perfectly secure in their lifestyle, and we’ve illustrated that with this Thanksgiving display,” said Samantha Vimes, an organizer of the event with the League of Conservation Voters. 
“Part of the idea was displaying the wealth, the resources that they continue to have and take advantage of,” she continued.

“Too many of our representatives care about that more than our actual lives,” added Rachael Rewitzer, another organizer with the League of Conservation Voters. “So we needed something more visual, because how many times can we tell our representatives that people are starving, dying of thirst, dying of all of these different issues, and then they just continue to do nothing. How much more explicit can we be for them to see what it is that we’re struggling with?”
The demonstration was also inspired by a sense of frustration among advocates like Rewitzer, who feels as though she is being ignored when reaching out to her elected officials — including James. 
“We needed to try something that was a bit more unique, a bit more creative, that was going to capture attention, since clearly the traditional methods that we are told to go through are not working,” she said.

Jill Murphy, an advocate with Michigan Families for Fair Care, felt that the call for affordable health care in particular was personal to her, as she navigates insurance concerns and rising prices. 
But the response from passersby, she added, was empowering. 
“We’ve had a couple families with their kids walk by and they were really into it, asking all the questions,” Murphy said. “I thought that was pretty powerful because they weren’t in the know.”
The Protect MI Care Coalition and the Michigan League for Public Policy also participated in the demonstration.

In an interview Monday, Harris said she changed her voter registration to non-partisan on Oct. 3, after “a lot of soul searching and thoughts and conversations with my husband.”  
Just under 40% of District F’s 243,075 registered voters are non-partisan, while 28% are Democrats and 26% are Republicans.  
Commissioner Justin Jones, a Democrat who Harris unseated in the 2014 race for state Senate, is not running for reelection. Last year, he was sanctioned by a judge for deleting text messages sought in a lawsuit against the county by developer Jim Rhodes, who is building luxury homes on Blue Diamond Hill, an area adjacent to the Red Rock Conservation Area. 
Two Republicans, Assemblywoman Heidi Kasama, a loyalist of Gov. Joe Lombardo, and businessman Albert Mack, have announced they’ll run for the open seat. 
Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager has been mentioned as a potential Democratic contender in the race but has yet to state his intentions publicly. 
Harris says the decision to drop her party affiliation was not an effort to avoid a primary race, and insists she didn’t know that automatic inclusion on the general election ballot was a benefit of running as a non-partisan until she changed her registration.

“I don’t care for the vitriol and the unyielding positions of the two political parties,” she said. “Standing on party philosophy is not really helpful for people.” 
She declined to say if President Donald Trump’s influence on the Republican Party colored her decision. 
“Both parties are failing to govern in an effective manner and act in the interest of the voters,” she said. “We need candidates who are not affected by a party and want to help the community.”  
Harris contends she’s a “public servant at heart. I saw that my district might benefit from better leadership, and wanted to step up and represent the members of my community,” she said. “I was concerned about some things I’ve seen – the lawsuits and things against the commission, and decided I wanted to be part of the solution.”
Her website says she seeks to “serve residents, not special interests.” 
Harris says her priority, if elected to the county commission, will be “ensuring middle class families have an affordable rent or affordable mortgage payment that’s not going to up-end their budget.” 
Approximately 38.1% of households in Clark County are cost-burdened, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs. More than half of renters in Southern Nevada are cost-burdened. 
Rather than requiring developers to include an affordable housing component in their communities, Harris said she favors working with developers to “see where those types of projects make sense.”
Multi-family housing is “just part of living in a diverse community,” she says of residents who oppose apartments in their neighborhoods. “I have owned homes where we had apartments on the other side of our block wall, and it’s been fine. You’ve got to balance the needs of all our communities to have appropriate housing.” 
The southwest part of the valley, which includes District F, needs improved roads and other infrastructure, she says, and “development is still underway.” 
Asked if developers should bear a greater burden in providing parks and other infrastructure, 
Harris pivoted to the county’s “poor judgment decisions” that led to its decision to agree to pay an $80 million settlement with Rhodes’ Gypsum Resources for attempting to thwart its development and avoid a larger potential judgment.
“Just to put it into perspective, it’s $15 million to build a fire station. I don’t know how much it is to build a park, but certainly that money could have been better spent on amenities for the community,” she said. 
Harris declined to say whether Nevada’s property tax cap, passed by lawmakers to alleviate concerns of rising property tax bills during the real estate boom that preceded the Great Recession, should be lifted or adjusted to prevent lost revenue to local governments.
In 2023, the Current reported assessed value in Clark County had increased by more than $30 billion in the preceding decade.  Property tax revenue did not keep pace.
The abatements have caused Clark County and other governments to turn to other sources, such as sales taxes and fees, to pay for public safety. Both place a disproportionate burden on low-income residents. 
“Since I haven’t seen budgets, I can’t speak particularly to all of that, but I think property taxes are part of the housing affordability equation,” Harris said. 
She says she’s unfamiliar with the details of Lombardo’s housing initiative, which provides subsidies to buyers of market level housing who earn up to 150% of area median income, but does not address the dearth of low-income and extremely low-income units.
Harris says she is “100%” supportive of the Campus for Hope, a partnership of the state and casinos to provide transitional housing and other services to the unhoused in Southern Nevada. She cites “a really great model” called A Brighter Way in Maricopa County, Arizona. “They have a campus where people can come and spend the day, and they also have housing for people that want to live in housing, recognizing that not all homeless want to live in a structure.”
Harris has lived in Southern Nevada since 1999. In 2001 she testified on behalf of the Coalition for the Protection of Marriage, an anti-gay marriage group, against a bill that would have allowed people in same-sex relationships to designate a non-spouse to deal with issues such as illness and medical care. She also contributed $3,000 to the organization. 
Her positions on LGBTQ+ issues, she says, have since evolved.
“During my time at the Legislature, as I learned more about the different interests of people in the community, I came to be  respected and had a very productive relationship with the LGBTQ trans communities,” she said. “They’d be in my office on a regular basis, and saw me as an advocate. I don’t know how anybody’s political perspectives don’t evolve once they begin to understand the larger community and the complicated issues that people face in their daily lives.”
Harris, who currently teaches at UNLV’s Boyd School of Law, served in the state Senate from 2014 to 2018, when then-Gov. Brian Sandoval appointed her as the first woman to chair the Gaming Control Board.
In March of 2018, the Wall Street Journal made long-reported but largely ignored stories of Steve Wynn’s alleged pattern of sexual intimidation too awkward for casino regulators to sweep under the carpet any longer. 
“Sexual harassment continues to be one of the most frequent complaints raised in the workplace,” Harris, then the newly-appointed chairwoman, wrote in a memo to all licensees.
Harris invoked Regulation Five, the “morals clause” of state gaming regulation — which states any act deemed “inimical to the public health, safety morals, good order and general welfare of the people of the State of Nevada, or that would reflect or tend to reflect discredit upon the State of Nevada or the gaming industry” may be grounds for action against the licensee.  
She proposed a checklist of items to be completed by licensees on an annual basis, to ensure compliance. The Gaming Commission, after significant delay, adopted the recommendations in 2020, under Gov. Steve Sisolak, who named a replacement for Harris after she had held the job for only a year.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ClarkCountyGovCtr_RondaChurchill_007-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-11-04 08:00:33.361585

For the past several years, the increases in tax collections by the state have continued to decline as subsidies from the federal government decline and sales tax revenues decrease. (Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)The growth in tax collections declined in 2025 and the trend is expected to continue for 2026, according to a report from the Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama.
The report said that revenues for the General Fund and the Educational Trust Fund budgets increased 3.5% and 2.5% respectively for the year after several years of rapid growth,
“Tax revenues flowing into Alabama state government returned to a more normal rate of growth in 2025, after several years of unusually high gains,” PARCA said in a statement that accompanied the report. “Revenue flowing into both the General Fund and the Education Trust Fund grew at about the rate of inflation.”

A message was sent to PARCA on Monday seeking additional comment.
Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, the chair of the Senate Finance and Taxation General Fund Committee, overseeing the General Fund, said in an interview Monday that he was not surprised.
“I think I could say that ‘I told you so,’’” he said. “We expected this. The only question was when and by exactly how much. We actually expected this a little bit sooner and we expected it to be worse. We expected interest rates to be further down. So far we have had a little bit of a break on that.”
Tax collections for the ETF reached almost $11 billion for the year while revenues for the General Fund budget totaled $3.6 billion, continuing the trend of increasing revenues going back to 2015.
That growth, while positive, marks the third straight year of declining revenue growth for the General Fund. Two years ago, revenues had increased by almost 17%. Last year, the increase declined by more than half, to about 7% before declining by half once again for 2025.
Revenues for the ETF touched almost 21% in 2022, due to a strong economy and federal COVID aid, before breaking even in 2023 and then increasing only slightly for the next two years to 2.2% for 2024 and 2.5% for 2025.
Much of the growth in the General Fund budget revenues stemmed from the interest in deposits because of supplemental funding from the federal government amid the coronavirus pandemic. The interest gained from that subsidy, along with increases in the interest earned from the Alabama Trust Fund, bolstered the General Fund budget.
Alabama earned a higher interest rate on its accounts after the Federal Reserve increased interest rates to address inflation after the pandemic, which then triggered an increase in the interest rates on the accounts of the state. However, the trend is expected to reverse in the coming years.
“Inflation has cooled, and the Federal Reserve has begun to lower its target interest rates. Budget surpluses are decreasing, and most of the extra federal money in state accounts is being spent,” the PARCA report said. “As interest rates continue to decline, revenue from interest will retreat.”
According to the report from PARCA, the interest income earned was at its peak in 2024 but declined by $52 million for the current fiscal year. The interest income from the two sources combined was $630 million, which comprised about 14% of all revenues that feed the General Fund.
The revenues that comprise much of ETF, sales and income taxes, remained largely stagnant from the previous year. The amount of sales tax collected, which is almost 25% of the ETF, increased by only 2.4% for the year even though Alabama reduced the state sales tax on groceries from 4% to 3%.
The largest component of the Educational Trust Fund budget, income taxes, increased by 6%, bringing in about $7.5 billion. That total increased by almost $230 million as the unemployment rate in the state remains low at about 2.9%, which is lower than the national rate at 4.3%.
However, some in Alabama remain out of the workforce as its labor force participation rate continues to lag behind other states at 58%, which ranks fourth from the bottom.
“Thus, Alabama still has untapped potential to draw more discouraged workers into the workforce to meet demand,” the report states. “By doing so, the individuals and the state would benefit from higher earnings and tax revenues.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Statehouse-0747-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-04 07:16:31.610328

(Getty Images)The Indiana Public Retirement System is divesting from holdings in Hong Kong worth almost $170 million, more than two years after lawmakers banned investments in Chinese interests.
Divestment from public equity assets should be complete by December, according to materials for INPRS’ Friday board meeting, and the agency is working to update performance benchmarks.
INPRS asset managers have already pulled out of fixed income holdings, per the board book, while benchmarks for those assets had “no exposure” to Hong Kong and didn’t need updates.
The packet says those changes came “following recent clarification” of 2023’s Senate Enrolled Act 268. It mandated divestment from a wide range of Chinese or Chinese-controlled companies and products, and blocked future investments in those entities.
The law, which went into effect in May 2023, directed INPRS to identify all its investments in restricted entities before June 30 that year, plus annually thereafter. The agency is required to complete divestment “as soon as financially prudent,” but is also subject to statutory deadlines.
The Indiana Public Retirement System’s board book, compiled for an Oct. 31, 2025 meeting, describes divestment efforts related to Hong Kong. (Screenshot)
 
The law’s timeline stipulates divestment of at least 50% within three years after an investment in a restricted entity is discovered, 75% within four years and 100% within five years.
INPRS celebrated shedding its $1.2 billion worth of investments in Chinese and Chinese-controlled entities last year — four years ahead of that schedule.
But the agency wasn’t counting its holdings in Hong Kong, Indianapolis Star Deputy Opinion Editor Jacob Stewart revealed in a September column. Stewart, who previously worked as a press secretary for the Indiana Senate Republican caucus, argued those investments pose a “clear national security risk.”
INPRS cited Hong Kong’s “separate constitution,” according to Stewart.
The law’s author, Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown, noted that document still calls Hong Kong an “inalienable part” of China. His intent was that the ban apply to Hong Kong, Stewart wrote.

Here’s some races we’ll be watching closely:
Minneapolis mayor
Mayor Jacob Frey is seeking a third term, facing a tough challenge from Sen. Omar Fateh, DeWayne Davis and Jazz Hampton.
Read the Minnesota Star Tribune’s profiles of Frey, Davis and Hampton.
The Reformer profiled Fateh last month.
Fateh, who is the strongest challenger to Frey, has promised to bring a democratic-socialist agenda to City Hall, including an income tax — which would require consent from the state Legislature — and rent control. Fateh, who once favored defunding the police until backtracking, has also promised to protect Minneapolis immigrants from federal law enforcement; he signed a petition that calls for Minneapolis to arrest masked federal agents.
Frey has governed during two terms of crisis, from the pandemic to the police murder of George Floyd and its aftermath. The city has struggled to come back to life since the pandemic, suffering from stagnant population growth and high commercial vacancies and resulting property tax increases on homeowners. Frey’s case for another term includes falling crime rates, relatively low rent increases compared to other large cities — thanks to an apartment building boom — as well as green shoots in Uptown, downtown and other neighborhoods.
Minneapolis voters will use ranked-choice voting, allowing them to rank candidates in order of preference. Voters don’t have to rank every candidate.
St. Paul mayor 
If Minneapolis has suffered a mild case of lethargy in the wake of the pandemic, St. Paul has more of a full-blown infection.
The city has lost two grocery stores, including its only downtown grocer. Rent control that passed in 2021 with the support of Mayor Melvin Carter seems to have eroded development, even as rents often increased more than the 3% the law allows due to various carveouts.
Key neighborhoods like Lowertown and the Midway have endured high commercial vacancy rates and nuisance crime. Population growth citywide has stalled and residential property taxes have spiked in recent years.
Carter is a charismatic, dynamic figure who has overseen a steep drop in gun crime, and his reelection seemed all but certain just a few months ago.
But Rep. Kaohly Her, Carter’s former policy aide, jumped in the race in August and has put up a stiff challenge, promising competency and vibrancy.
Her came to the United States as a three-year-old refugee after the Vietnam War and would be the city’s first Hmong-American and first woman mayor.
As in Minneapolis, St. Paul voters will use ranked-choice voting, allowing them to rank candidates in order of preference. Voters don’t have to rank every candidate.
Special Senate elections 
GOP Sen. Bruce Anderson of Buffalo died in July, and Democratic-Farmer-Labor Sen. Nicole Mitchell resigned after a lengthy criminal saga that resulted in a first-degree burglary conviction.
Prior to the two vacancies earlier this year, Democrats controlled the Minnesota Senate 34-33.
Rep. Amanda Hemmingsen-Jaeger is running as the DFL candidate for Senate District 47, which includes Woodbury and part of Maplewood. This seat was formerly held by Mitchell.
Hemmingsen-Jaeger was first elected to the Minnesota House in 2022. She has a science background, holding degrees in cell biology, genetics and environmental policy. She’s worked for the departments of Public Safety and Human Services.
Senate District 47 leans blue, but it may be competitive in a low-turnout special election to replace a disgraced Democrat.
The Republican candidate is Dwight Dorau, an Air Force veteran and a teacher in the Junior ROTC program at Johnson High School in St. Paul. Dorau is a retired colonel, and he served in Afghanistan. In 2022, Dorau lost his bid for the District 47 seat to Mitchell by 18 percentage points.
Michael Holmstrom Jr. is running as the Republican candidate for Senate District 29, which includes Buffalo, Monticello, Delano and Annandale. This seat was formerly held by Anderson.
Senate District 29 is a safely red district.
Holmstrom is a small business owner from Buffalo and a longtime Wright County GOP volunteer. On his campaign site, Holmstrom said he’s had years of “pro-life activism” and committed to “defending girls’ sports and standing with parents as the primary decision-makers in their children’s education.”
The Democratic candidate is Louis McNutt, an equipment mechanic for the Minnesota Department of Transportation. McNutt is also a union leader with AFSCME Local 221. He has made cost of living a centerpiece of his campaign for Senate.
School levies 
As Axios reported last month, Minnesota is host to about 44 general operating school levies — allowing the district wide latitude in how to spend the money — up significantly from the 30 that are typically on the ballot across Minnesota in an off-year election. About 50 additional ballot measures will fund school expansions and upgrades to security and technology and other specific uses.
In St. Paul, voters are being asked to support a $37.2 million property tax increase — costing the median homeowner about $500 a year. Without the increase, the district says that “services that families and students value, such as transportation, extracurriculars and additional academic supports, will be reduced.”

The divisive and powerful 9/11-era vice president was also a devoted husband, avid outdoorsman and close advisor to his daughter, Liz Cheney. 
The post Dick Cheney, Wyoming oilman and former vice president, dies at 84 appeared first on WyoFile .","Dick Cheney, the Wyoming oilman and politician who was widely considered to be the most powerful vice president in America’s history, died on Monday. He was 84. 
Cheney, who grew up largely in Casper, served as Wyoming’s sole U.S. representative in Congress from 1979-1989. It was among his many roles in Washington. At age 34, he became the youngest presidential chief of staff in history when President Gerald Ford appointed him to the post. He served as secretary of defense under George H.W. Bush, and years later joined the ticket of George W. Bush to become vice president, serving two terms.
He and his wife of 61 years, Lynne, continued to live part-time in Jackson, and often hosted family there. Later in his life, Cheney became a close political advisor to his eldest daughter, Liz Cheney, who followed in his footsteps with a career in politics — and one that also grew polarizing.
Cheney was famously in D.C. as terrorists attacked America on Sept. 11, 2001, the defining event of his career. With President Bush in Florida that day, Cheney presided over the chaotic and terrifying early hours of the attack from the Presidential Emergency Operations Center located underneath the White House — authorizing military force against civilian airplanes. He later became the chief architect of the war on terror. 
While Cheney had admirers who respected his clear-eyed decisiveness, formidable intelligence and enduring patriotism, he also had detractors. The latter camp decried the surveillance and interrogation tactics implemented under his leadership as blatant civil liberties violations, and portrayed him as a Darth-Vaderesque figure — a sinister, secretive force orchestrating behind the scenes of the Bush administration. 
In a nod to that, Cheney once showed up dressed as the “Star Wars” villain for a “Tonight Show” interview with Jay Leno. That, friends say, is an example of his sense of humor and proof that he was far more complicated than he was portrayed to be.
“He was fun and he could be funny, but he was also very serious,” said Judy Legerski of Lander, who has known Cheney since she worked on his first congressional campaign. “He was just a good, solid person. And a real guy.”
Friends remember Cheney as a cool-headed man of steely loyalty and deep consideration for others. He was a devoted husband and father, an avid fisherman and an accomplished outdoorsman. (He did find himself the subject of jokes after accidentally shooting an acquaintance during a 2006 hunting trip.) He wasn’t one for small talk, but if engaged on the right topic, he would expound at length. 
“Dick’s one of the smartest people I’ve ever known in my life,” Legerski said. “His abilities of analysis were remarkable. You could ask a question, and he’d answer it like he’d done a research study on the topic two days before.”

Cheney was even-keeled and straightforward, a scholar of American history who loved dogs and was never one for the drama.  
“He looked you right in the face if you had something to say,” remembers John McConnell, who was Cheney’s speechwriter in the White House. “He kind of had a way of tilting his head and listening to you, and he just was always great to work with. He was the most considerate and appreciative person I’ve ever worked for.”
He was hard-working and deeply committed to serving the country, said Steve Hadley, who served with Cheney at the Pentagon then in the White House as national security adviser. 
“I would hope that [Americans] would recognize him as a man of integrity and talent, who loved the country, who put service to the country as his top priority, and was a terrific vice president in being supportive of the president and doing what the president needed him to do in order to keep this country safe,” Hadley said.
Cheney is survived by his wife, Lynne, daughters Liz and Mary, and several grandchildren.
Early life
Richard Bruce Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska on Jan. 30, 1941 to a family of New Deal Democrats. His father was quiet, his mother high-spirited and convivial. His family moved to Casper when he was 13 after the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Soil Conservation Service reassigned his father to a new post.
As an adolescent, he played sports, explored the high plains with his brother, Bob, and developed a fishing addiction. Though a voracious reader of history, he was never a great student. In high school, he met and fell in love with Lynne Vincent, a bright and pretty student who was the state champion baton twirler. During their senior year at Natrona County High School, he was class president and she was homecoming queen. (The school’s football field now bears his name.)
Though a bit aimless, Cheney was advised by Casper oilman Tom Stroock to apply to Yale. Stroock assured Cheney the elite East Coast university was interested in geographic diversity. Cheney was accepted and awarded a full scholarship. 
But after arriving in New Haven, Cheney fell in with a group of boys more interested in a good time than good grades, according to his memoir, “In My Time.” After two false starts, Cheney failed out. 
He returned to Wyoming to “work in the tools” as a union member on jobs like installing electrical transmission lines. The work, which was physical and could be dangerous, paid well, but Cheney fell deeper into drinking with his work buddies. He was arrested twice for driving under the influence. The second arrest became a crucial fulcrum point in his life.

“Lynne, after spending a semester in Europe, had graduated summa cum laude from Colorado College,” Cheney recalled in his memoir. “And I was sleeping off a hangover in the Rock Springs jail.”
Determined to turn his life around, he stopped frequenting bars and enrolled at the University of Wyoming. In 1964, Lynne accepted his marriage proposal. They were married in August that year, and Cheney turned his focus to a career and fatherhood.
Politics 
Cheney studied political science at UW, and got his first taste of political machinations as an intern in the Wyoming Legislature. Though he and Lynne had both planned to become college professors, his interests led him instead into politics. His first job came during the Nixon administration in 1969, when then-Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity Donald Rumsfeld hired Cheney as a congressional relations aide. That was the beginning of a decades-long mentorship and working relationship with Rumsfeld. 
When Rumsfeld became President Gerald Ford’s chief of staff in 1974, Cheney acted as his deputy. And when Rumsfeld was bumped to secretary of defense in 1975, Cheney was promoted to fill the chief of staff vacancy. 
After Ford lost his re-election bid to Jimmy Carter in 1976, Cheney decided to run for office himself. Not long after he moved Lynne and their two daughters back to Casper, he set his sights on the state’s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. That’s when Legerski met him. 
“Dick and two others were running on the Republican primary, and at the time, I was, for whatever reason, a hot political commodity around here,” Legerski said. “So each of these three people came and talked to me, and after talking to them, I determined that Dick was the guy I would support.”
She was impressed with his intellect and demeanor, she said.
That first primary, when Cheney vied against Ed Witzenburger and Jack Gage for the GOP nomination, was the toughest of his six campaigns for House, Cheney recalled in his memoir. After many previous years in D.C., one of his major tasks was convincing residents that he was in touch with them. He embarked on a dizzying tour of Wyoming diners, radio stations and town halls.

He was campaigning in Cheyenne in June 1978 when he awoke in the middle of the night with tingling in his left hand. Cheney, 37 at the time, was having a heart attack. 
He was treated and released with instructions to rest. He quit smoking and began to eat healthier. Meanwhile, Lynne filled in on his campaign events. After winning the primary, he beat the Democratic challenger. 
Cheney was re-elected five times, serving until 1989. 
He honed his national security knowledge, assembled a team of Wyoming staffers and worked alongside Republicans such as Newt Gingrich and Phil Gramm. Cheney served as House Minority Whip and chairman of the House Republican Conference.
Among his legislative achievements, he was particularly proud of the 1984 Wyoming Wilderness Act, which added nearly 1 million acres to the state’s wilderness areas. Cheney worked closely with fellow Wyoming congressmen Alan Simpson and Malcolm Wallop to pass the legislation.
The campaign heart attack, however, would be the first of a string of health troubles to plague Cheney. He experienced a second heart attack in 1984, and a third in 1988. He underwent quadruple bypass surgery, suffered a fourth attack in 2000 and received a ventricular assist device implant in 2010. In 2012, at the age of 71, he received a heart transplant, which bought him several more years of life.
Road to veep  
Cheney left the House in 1989 after President H.W. Bush appointed him secretary of defense. In that post, he oversaw Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm — key phases of the Gulf War. After Bill Clinton’s presidential election, Cheney took the opportunity to do some fishing, plying blue-ribbon waters from British Columbia to Oregon and New Zealand.  
Then he went into the private sector, working as chairman and CEO of the energy juggernaut Halliburton, headquartered in Dallas. The proximity allowed him to get to know George W. Bush, who was governor of Texas. Bush’s camp first asked Cheney to run Bush’s presidential campaign, which he declined. 
They came back with a new request: help search for a veep. Cheney agreed. Early efforts, however, were fruitless. Bush eventually persuaded Cheney to accept the post.

Legerski remembers where she was — riding the elevator at Little America in Salt Lake — when Cheney called to give her the news. “And I said, ‘Dick, I remember you telling me you were never hitching your wagon onto someone else’s star.’ And he said, ‘When your president asks, the only answer is yes,’” she said. “And that’s the kind of guy he was.”
The decision vaulted him into the national spotlight, where every aspect of his life was under scrutiny. That included his views on gay rights. Cheney’s daughter, Mary, had come out as gay to the family years before, and he supported her. When asked in a debate about gay marriage, he was careful, answering that while people should be free to enter any relationship they want, gay marriage should be left to individual states, not subject to federal policy.
Famously, the Bush v. Gore election was controversial, with the U.S. Supreme Court settling the recount dispute in Bush’s favor in December 2000. It was a bumpy start for Cheney, who had suffered another heart attack during the prolonged recount process. It also foretold a difficult era. 
Less than a year later, terrorists attacked America on Sept. 11. That morning, a special agent burst through Cheney’s office door, hoisted him by his belt and hustled him down to the emergency operation room, telling Cheney an unidentified aircraft was heading toward the White House. 
As with the rest of the country, 9/11 left indelible impacts on Cheney. He became determined to quash terrorists and their supporters with whatever tools of national power were accessible. 
“I think that had a searing effect on him,” said Pete Williams, a former NBC news correspondent who worked as Cheney’s press secretary for seven years. “I think he felt that virtually anything that was conceivable to prosecute the war on terror, he was willing to consider.”

In the years that followed, Cheney was criticized for authorizing controversial counterterrorism policies, promoting the inaccurate claim that Iraq was linked to 9/11 and helping to expand executive power. Critics said Cheney committed war crimes, citing the country’s use of domestic spying, torture and indefinite detention. 
“He never flinched when the going got tough, or when the criticism became heated as it did,” McConnell said. 
The actions also stem from Cheney’s interpretation of the job, Hadley said. “I think he would say that the first responsibility of the president and vice president was to keep the nation secure, and he took that very seriously.” 
Other factors led to Cheney exerting power in ways beyond previous VPs, who had mainly been figureheads. Unlike Bush, Cheney possessed decades of foreign policy, White House and congressional experience. Bush delegated meaningful tasks to him, which meant he served as a kind of chief operating officer for the president, exerting major influence in policy decisions.
As a vice president, Cheney divided the public in unprecedented fashion. People either viewed him with deep admiration, or as a secretive and corrupt man who orchestrated a dark chapter in America’s history — and not much in between. 
The latter view was made manifest in “Vice,” a 2018 film starring Christian Bale as Cheney, a cunning and ruthlessly ambitious sociopath. 
Reconciling the man and the reputation 
Those who knew Cheney personally are adamant that the “Vice” character couldn’t be further from the truth. 
“The last thing I would describe him as is taciturn or sour,” said Williams. “He was thoughtful, he was serious, he was highly focused. I very quickly realized that Dick Cheney did not do small talk … but I found him to have a great sense of humor, a very self-deprecating sense of humor.”
When it came to the war on terror, Williams said, “I think he felt that was the right thing to do to save the country.”

Legerski can see why Cheney could come off as remote. “I think in some ways, his gravitas was off-putting to some people,” she said. But she remembers a warm and considerate family man. The first time Liz Cheney ran for Congress, Legerski remembers, one of the drawbacks was that she wouldn’t be available to chauffeur her daughter to rodeos. 
“So Dick got a truck, and he hauled [his granddaughter] and her horse to all the summer rodeos,” Legerski said. He adorned the pickup’s trailer hitch cover with an image of Darth Vader.
Cheney largely disappeared from the public eye until the aftermath of Jan. 6. Republican support of Cheney and Liz fractured after the younger Cheney became a prominent critic of Donald Trump’s actions related to the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection. Cheney backed his daughter.
He had a refreshing straightforwardness, McConnell said. 
“He had high expectations, but he was always fair, easy to deal with in the sense that you knew where you stood with him,” he said. McConnell remembers getting irritated when Cheney would be attacked in the press. Cheney seemed to accept it as part of the gig, and was too busy doing his job to spend much effort refuting the flak. McConnell often wondered if Cheney took the heat so that Bush didn’t have to.
“He wasn’t out there to improve his own image, he was there to serve the president and the country,” he said.
In a 2014 article in Stanford Medicine about Cheney’s long-standing heart issues, Cheney told the publication that before his transplant, he had confronted his mortality. 
“I thought about it, I guess, I was at peace,” Cheney said in the article. “I had come to that point where I fully expected that I had lived a wonderful and remarkable life. I had a tremendous family. I had everything a man could ask for.”

Soon after, dozens of women spoke out about a Capitol culture that was often more frat house than statehouse, sparking a reckoning that predated the #MeToo movement by two years.
House leadership promised change, rolling out reforms meant to clean up the culture: mandatory harassment training, an ombudsman for interns, bans on fraternization, and outside investigators for complaints.
The goal, as then-Speaker Todd Richardson put it, was to ensure “interns, staff and (legislators) can have a workplace where they are treated with respect.”
It’s worth emphasizing one word in that quote: workplace.
Elected officials may grab the headlines, but hundreds of staffers work in that marble building every day, doing the unglamorous jobs that make state government function. It can be a strange environment — part political circus, part pressure cooker — but it’s still a workplace.
And the same rules of respect and professionalism should apply.
Last year brought another reminder that those lessons never seem to stick.
That time, the scandal wasn’t about sexual harassment, but about alleged retaliation and intimidation by a powerful lawmaker, with nonpartisan legislative staff describing a “culture of fear” where employees who raised concerns about mistreatment or impropriety faced punishment.
Different behavior, same disregard for workplace norms.
The point was underscored again last week when the House Ethics Committee convened to investigate a text message sent by freshman Democratic Rep. Jeremy Dean to a fellow lawmaker during a contentious special session in September.
The message was explicit, crude and wildly inappropriate for a professional setting. Dean apologized publicly, calling it a lapse in judgment. His party leaders stripped him of committee assignments, and he awaits punishment by the Ethics Committee.
To his credit, Dean didn’t deny or deflect. His willingness to apologize and face consequences marks progress from a time when such behavior might have been ignored or excused. But the fact that a message like his was sent at all shows how far the Capitol still has to go.
Was Dean’s text on the same level as the harassment scandals of 2015 or the retaliation accusations that dominated headlines last year? Of course not.
But it’s part of the same pattern — a culture that too often forgets this is supposed to be a workplace. In nearly any other job in America, sending an obscene message to a colleague would get you fired.
No one is calling for Dean’s expulsion. But the episode serves as a fresh reminder that all those reforms from 2015 were just the starting line, not the finish. Policies and training set expectations, but they can’t legislate basic respect.
Every scandal, every whisper of intimidation or disrespect, chips away at public trust. If lawmakers can’t model professionalism inside the Capitol, why should voters trust them to manage the state?
So here’s a refrain worth repeating until it finally sticks: the Capitol is a workplace. It’s long past time for everyone under its dome to start acting like it.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Rooted & Rising, a food center and Hunger Task Force partner, has provided nourishment to people living in Milwaukee’s Washington Park neighborhood for over three decades. The lapse in federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, known in Wisconsin as FoodShare, that began on Saturday is increasing desperation, according to staff. Over the last week, Bill Schmitt, executive director of Rooted & Rising, told the Wisconsin Examiner, “197 households came through the food center…And that’s about a 60% increase over what we would usually see.” 
On Friday, Gov. Tony Evers declared a state of emergency in Wisconsin due to the lapse in federal SNAP funding.

By Monday afternoon people from more than 50 local households had already arrived at Rooted & Rising to pick up canned goods and  locally grown produce. Schmitt said the numbers on Monday showed a sustained spike. 
Rooted & Rising provides food once a month, or every 30 days, from noon to 4 p.m., in a neighborhood where, according to the food center’s website, the unemployment rate exceeds 15% and 50% of households live below the poverty line. 
“We know a lot of people came out last week,” Schmitt said, referring to the over 60% spike the pantry saw just before  SNAP benefits were cut off. “We’re just trying to keep pace with the demand and make sure that people still have a dignified, respectful experience here and they’re not having to wait too long.” 
Rooted & Rising’s shelves are stocked with assorted canned goods, boxes hold ripe fruits and vegetables and freezers preserve perishables including meat. People sit in chairs while staff buzz past carrying boxes and help load bags into cars. First-time visitors must present an I.D. and a current piece of mail.
On Monday, elderly people and parents with small children visited the food center, gathering  enough food in their carts to last three days or so. “It’s families just like yours and mine really,” said Schmitt. “It is primarily working families. And people are fitting in visits to the food center with their work schedule when they can, or someone’s coming on their behalf. And we know across the state, it’s 700,000 individuals that rely upon these benefits. And the majority of those families…They’re trying to make ends meet.” 
While there was a rise in the number of families visiting the food center at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Rooted & Rising has seen a more recent uptick over the last year. In addition to the regulars, many people are either new families or people who hadn’t visited the food center in quite some time. “Our assessment of it is like wages just aren’t keeping pace with inflation,” said Schmitt. “There’s obviously been a sustained period of inflationary pressure in the economy more broadly, and subsequently we’ve seen, I mean, even before this government shutdown, our numbers were considerably higher than the year previous.”

Prior to last year, Rooted & Rising would see between 250-350 households a month. In October,  517 households came to the food center for assistance. 
“It is both the actual impact of the delayed food share benefits going out, but really it’s also like the uncertainty of it that we all know in our own lives,” Schmitt said. 










So last week, we had the busiest week in the history of our food center in anticipation of these food benefits not going out.


– Bill Schmitt, executive director of Rooted & Rising.


Leah Boonnam, 33, comes from one of those new families. Monday was the third time she’d come to Rooted & Rising.  She started coming to the food center back in the summer. “It’s a long story,” she said after loading groceries into her car. “I’m a widow. My husband passed a few years ago. So we don’t get FoodShare, I don’t get anything like that. We live off the survivors benefits. And so we’ve had to move a lot, like downsize.” 
A friend told Boonnam to check out the food center, which has been a big help to her family. While she works various jobs, Boonnam’s husband was her family’s main provider. “My plan is to finish paying off my debt to school so I can return and finish my degree, my masters,” she told the Wisconsin Examiner. “However, when I started my program, my husband had passed. It was right at the start of COVID and everything. So, he was the one that was the major breadwinner for our family.” Boonnam said she works hard, but “nothing compares to having two incomes in a household.” 
“I wish people didn’t feel so bad about having to come here,” she added. “This is a really beautiful thing that is available to us. I mean, this is such a help.”

”A lot of the fresh organic stuff that they get here is from the food pantries, and these are local businesses that are helping to support local people,” Boonnam said.
Another visitor, a friendly 48-year-old man who only wanted to be identified by his first name, Isaac, said he’d been coming to Rooted & Rising for about six years. “It’s very important because things are getting hectic and people don’t have no other options,” he said of SNAP.  If food assistance programs were to halt completely, Isaac said he worries  “crime might raise, or a lot of chaos.” He hopes that after the current federal shutdown is over, states will “plan ahead and think ahead,” grow food bank networks and provide “things that can assist folks who are in crisis. … We’ll make it, just a little more tender love and care.”
Bonny Walters, an older woman who has helped out at Rooted & Rising for more than 30 years, has seen the numbers of people needing the food center “increase a lot,” she said.  She hopes that even if people don’t help out at a food center, they understand that the need is real. 
With the future of SNAP still up in the air and the government shutdown continuing, Schmitt said the generosity of neighbors is more important than ever. Across Milwaukee County, food drives are being held to help provide a cushion for local residents who rely on FoodShare to survive. So far, over $74,000 has been raised — enough to provide over 222,000 meals. The Brewers Community Foundation made a $10,000 donation. Local elected leaders have criticized  the Trump administration for using hunger and food security as a political bargaining chip in Washington D.C.

Schmitt explained that Rooted & Rising, as part of Milwaukee County’s emergency food network, is designed to meet the emergency nutritional needs of families on a monthly basis. “We do not have the capacity, or the resources, or even the physical space or stocks to fill the gap of the loss of FoodShare,” he said. 
“There’s a really visceral situation when you’re talking about people in your communities not having enough to eat and like, skipping meals, or you know, going hungry sometimes, too,” he added. “It’s crazy to think about that — in the wealthiest country in human history that this is an issue that we’re confronting right now. But, people have really been stepping up and we’re going to continue to rely upon that generosity of our community members and partners to kind of recognize that this is a unique moment, and one that requires all of us to work together and kind of meet the moment, meet the need of our fellow community members.”

Deputy Secretary of State Aghogho Edevbie and Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum attended the forum hosted by The People’s Coalition, a progressive group that advocates for justice, equity and sustainability. Invited but not attending the forum due to a work commitment was former Michigan Sen. Adam Hollier of Detroit, who is also seeking the Democratic nomination.
Byrum and Edevbie were both asked what their top priorities would be as secretary of state, should they secure the nomination and go on to win against their eventual Republican opponent.
Edevbie said he was running to fight for democracy and to make the elections system accountable to each Michigander. Byrum, who frequently pushes back on election dis- and misinformation on social media, said she, too, was running to help protect Michigan democracy against the threats of voter suppression and voter apathy.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The conversation quickly turned to the most pressing of those threats – the rise of American fascism and authoritarianism during the first year of President Donald Trump’s second term in the White House.
Byrum said she would not sit idly by while Trump and his followers “attack” the ballot access gains seen in Michigan over the past few years, and that includes any attempt to roll back the changes made by Proposal 2 of 2022, which created new processes that made it easier to vote.
Trump signed an executive order in March promoting the tenets of the Safeguard Voter Eligibility [SAVE] Act, which would require proof of citizenship to register to vote. Republicans in Michigan are attempting to get a constitutional amendment passed in 2026 requiring the same in the Great Lakes state.
Michigan Democrats, advocates vow to fight Trump election order: ‘We’ll see him in court’

Byrum said it would be a priority to stand against those attempts as secretary of state. She added that she did so in 2012, when then-Secretary of State Ruth Johnson, who now serves as a Michigan state senator, attempted to push measures requiring proof of citizenship to vote.
“That disenfranchises voters and does absolutely nothing to make our elections any safer or secure,” she said. “That’s what I continue to plan to do, to stand up and speak out [against] those who try and disenfranchise our voters.”
Edevbie touched on Trump’s executive order to reprogram election machines across the nation, and said he had meetings with other deputy secretaries of state and the White House directly, asking the administration difficult questions about its plans as it pursued that goal.
He said he worked closely with Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel to craft a multi-state lawsuit that stopped the order in its tracks.
“The fact that Trump is going to have people trying to chase after undocumented individuals in our cities, sending ICE after people, maybe putting them at polling locations. All of these challenges are going to stress our system,” Edevbie said. “But suffice to say, we are coming up with a plan to be ready to ensure that every single person in the state still has access to absentee ballots, still has access to early voting, and still has access to voting on Election Day.”
Still, the state needs to think about the long-term threats on the horizon, and that’s why he champions a Michigan Voting Rights Act, predicting that federal voting rights would expire soon in the face of legal threats. 
Of note, the U.S. Supreme Court said recently that it would set a Louisiana gerrymandering case up for reargument to decide if Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act is still constitutional.

Section 2 of the act bans the use of race in crafting new legislative and congressional district lines during the decennial redistricting process. The section is in play again amid the backdrop of Republican states scrambling to redistrict their states to give the GOP a stronger advantage in a gridlocked Congress, and as Democrats seek to do the same as a defensive response.
“We have to be prepared to still protect the rights of every single Michigander,” he said.
Election security, which Republicans have used – along with the misinformation on the 2020 election – as a justification to pursue citizen-only voting measures, was also discussed.
Edevbie said election security was critical and was one of the key components of Proposal 2.
“We’ve seen all activity for MAGA folks who are literally trying to disrupt our vote. And I’m going to continue that fight every single day,” he said. “I think we also have to realize that there are a lot of different obstacles to voters’ confidence, and so I want to, as secretary of state, have a streamlined and uniform process for reporting returns.”
Edevbie said that when clerks report election returns, he wants everybody to understand how they’re coming out, what ballots are being counted, and what ballots are being reported.
“Whether it’s early voting or absentee, and so there’s that full clarity, so that no one doubts our election system,” he said.
Byrum said the idea of election security was top of mind for her in the upcoming election, as she previously served on Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s election security task force.
“When we talk about early returns and having returns quickly … It is not always about quickness, but it is always about the safety and security of our elections,” Byrum said. “Those unofficial results, they were brought to the county and then read in. And so we need to make sure that although we would like instant results, we have to maintain our focus on keeping our elections safe and secure.”
Both were asked about their stance on accepting large or corporate political action committee, or PAC, donations, now and into the future if one were to be the nominee. In that same vein, the candidates were asked to discuss how they would use their role to address the outsized influences such donations have in state and local campaigns. The moderators specifically called out the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, and lobbying from the state’s large regulated utilities.
Byrum did not touch on AIPAC, whether she would accept corporate political action committee money or their overall influence, but did say that she worked to ensure Ingham County residents had a clear view of spending in local races through a computer program that let people track who was giving to which candidate and how that money was spent.
“That’s been live for two years,” she said. “I think it’s important that we make sure the information is available, first and foremost, in an easy and understandable way for people to see.”
Edevbie said he was the only Democratic candidate in the race who has pledged not to accept corporate political action committee money. He also said it was important for Michigan to reform its campaign finance system, because it is, in his view, corrupt. Edevbie used the example of last year’s lame duck session, when Democrats, even though they held a firm majority in both chambers of the Legislature, hit a snag on legislation that bucked the wishes of larger corporate interests.
“We have to focus on why that happened. There are these things called leadership PACs, where every single elected official and our legislators can have numerous leadership PACs,” he said. “And Lee Chatfield, as former Speaker of the House, who’s now been indicted, had dozens of leadership PACs. … I want to get rid of that and limit anybody to one leadership pack altogether.”
Edevbie also said there was too much “dark money” in our politics, which corporations and other interests can use to insert their agendas into the political process without disclosing who they are. He said he would fight for real disclosure laws with teeth, and would support long-gestating Freedom of Information Act reforms to get a clearer view into the Legislature and the governor’s office.
Among the last questions were more pointed queries on the citizenship proposal, but also the ranked choice voting proposal that is currently out for signature gathering. 
Byrum was among county clerks who last month issued a rare statement against the ranked choice proposal, citing timeliness issues related to election certification and delays in the recount or audit process. That position oddly also aligned with that of the far-right election denial group Pure Integrity Michigan Elections.  
Regardless, Byrum said at the forum that if that proposal gets enough signatures to reach the ballot, and it wins the day, she said she was confident that clerks across the state would be able to implement it as seamlessly as possible. Byrum said she was also against the citizens-only voting proposal because it would, in her view, do nothing to make elections safer or more secure. 
Edevibe was caught in an odd position with the question because, as deputy secretary of state, all of those petitions have to come before him and Benson. In that vein, he could not take a formal position on either. Still, he said he opposed the concept of requiring proof of citizenship.
“I oppose that concept with everything, because ultimately the Republicans are trying to pick and choose their own voters, and that is something that is definitely not appropriate,” he said.

We have our work cut out for us, but we are determined to keep pushing for solutions to our housing crisis.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Marc Mihaly: Talking about more housing affordable to Vermonters.","This commentary is by Rep. Marc Mihaly, D-Calais. He is chair of the House General and Housing Committee.


It’s no secret that we have a housing emergency in this state — there’s not enough housing and what’s available is beyond the reach of most Vermonters. Our efforts to address this crisis have only just begun.
The absence of affordable housing makes it hard for businesses, schools and local governments — well, just about everyone — to find and keep new employees. It contributes to our homeless problem. Young people and families can’t move to Vermont. This creates a ripple effect that exacerbates the cost of our health insurance and our property taxes that pay for education. 
As the chair of the Vermont House of Representatives committee that works on housing issues, I spend my days (and my nights) thinking about this problem.
While addressing our housing needs is daunting, I am encouraged by the progress we’ve already made. Last session, we passed a bill that addresses many key housing issues that the governor signed. The bill was the result of testimony from people across every sector, state agency, trade, alliance and industry that is engaged in housing. It was heard at hearings over the course of more than two months. 
No one bill can solve the housing problem and certainly not all at once, but this law makes a modest start. The law: 

makes it easier to finance housing and related infrastructure;
provides funding to develop housing that lower income and middle-income Vermonters can afford to rent and buy;
provides for studies to enable us to legislate promotion of prefabricated modular housing;
includes assistance to mobile home parks and owners; and
creates opportunities to acquire and rebuild abandoned and dilapidated housing.

But, and it’s a big “but,” we’ve just started. There’s so much yet to be done. The shortage of truly affordable housing stymies our chance at serious economic growth, so we’ve got to act and do so quickly.
Success requires that we work on several fronts. We need to find more ways to fund housing. The market is broken; it costs double what Vermonters can afford to produce a house or apartment.
Developers are hesitant to build because they can’t produce a house or apartment at a price the average Vermonter can afford. We need to work creatively to find more public and private capital to assist in reducing the price of new houses and apartments. 
We don’t just have a money problem; we have a workforce challenge. We must help swell the ranks of the building trades. Only with more carpenters, electricians, plumbers, and heating and ventilating contractors, will we be able to build the housing we need.
As it stands now, even if we found the money to make housing affordable, we don’t currently have enough people to build the units Vermonters need. We  must fund and implement training programs and encourage young Vermonters to join the building trades. 
These efforts are only the start of what we have to do. This legislative session, we will also look at:

Ways to address permit reform to make it easier to get government permission to build homes and apartments, and more difficult for a few opponents to draw out appeals of permits for years when there’s no good reason for the opposition.
How to make it easier for towns to turn abandoned homes into real housing. 
Addressing the short-term rental proliferation in a way that both respects local conditions but ensures we keep our housing stock primarily for long-term occupancy by Vermonters. 
Find ways to make it easier and cheaper to buy and own mobile homes, the least expensive housing in Vermont. 
Find ways, as difficult as it might be, to make it attractive to be a landlord in Vermont while ensuring that tenants have true security.

The legislature is ready to take on these issues. I’m encouraged that the governor signed our first bill and has made statements that indicate he cares about housing. But words, whether from the Legislature or the governor, aren’t enough.
We have our work cut out for us, but we are determined to keep pushing for solutions to our housing crisis.

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Members of the Indiana Black Legislative Caucus and multiple community advocates gathered Monday inside the Statehouse rotunda to oppose Republican efforts to redraw Indiana’s congressional maps before the next census.
The rally came the same morning that GOP legislative leaders announced they won’t take up redistricting until December, postponing any action until weeks after Gov. Mike Braun called the General Assembly to reconvene Monday, Nov. 3. 
Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray said the delay “makes the most sense” logistically and financially, given that state lawmakers will technically meet during the regular legislative calendar.
Inside the Statehouse, speakers called the proposed mid-decade redistricting “unethical” and “morally corrupt,” warning it could weaken representation for Black, Latino and urban communities.
The two districts being targeted cover much of Indianapolis and northwest Indiana and currently have Democratic representation.
“The maps that shape our district also shape our futures,” said Rep. Earl Harris Jr., D-East Chicago, who chairs the Indiana Black Legislative Caucus. “Redistricting isn’t just a technical process — it’s a moral one. It determines resources in our communities and how voices are heard and how voices are counted.”
‘This is not the will of the people’
The two-hour event, dubbed “Democracy Doesn’t Get Redrawn,” featured Hoosier faith leaders, civil-rights groups and advocates from across the state, including the NAACP, Common Cause Indiana, the African American Coalition of Indianapolis and Indivisible Northwest Indiana.
Several speakers tied the renewed redistricting push to national GOP efforts led by President Donald Trump.
“Did any of you call for this, as citizens of Indiana? No. Did any of us as leaders call for this? No. This call came from outside the house — outside the state,” said Willis Bright, chair of the African American Coalition of Indianapolis.
“The idea for doing this has come from people who are eliminating means for health care for all of our people around the state of Indiana,” he continued. “It’s from people who are eliminating means for quality and equitable education for children. It is for people who have weaponized — politicized — independent organizations to go after people who don’t like what they stand for.”

Karla Lopez Owens, a Latino community advocate and attorney, noted that district lines are historically redrawn on a 10-year cycle, after every census. The current congressional maps were finalized in October 2021.
“What we’re seeing right now is unprecedented. This is not the will of the people. … We live in a democracy, not a dictatorship,” she said. “Those procedural safeguards are meant to give the public a chance to provide feedback, and these procedures are meant to be followed.”
Faith leaders framed the issue as a spiritual one, too. 
“When lines are drawn to lock some people out, injustice sneaks in,” said Rev. David Greene, president of the Concerned Clergy of Indianapolis. “When communities are split to weaken their power, democracy begins to crumble.”
Megan Robertson, executive director of Indiana Conservation Voters, said redistricting under federal political pressure betrays Hoosier values: “We’ve got folks in Washington, D.C., who are terrified of losing power and willing to cheat to win. That’s not how we do things in Indiana.”
Calls to ‘take action’
Julia Vaughn, executive director of Common Cause Indiana, urged Hoosiers to keep contacting lawmakers, saying multiple polls have shown opposition to mid-decade mapmaking. 
“These districts belong to us — not the Republican National Committee,” Vaughn said. “Mid-cycle redistricting is not OK for Indiana.”
She further warned about the dangers of political interference in the state’s redistricting process and stressed that the core values of American democracy “have never been under more stress.”
“For the past 20 years, we’ve had a supermajority drawing districts here in Indiana. It should be of no surprise to anyone that many of us feel under represented in our state,” Vaughn added. “We don’t need new maps. We need fair maps. Let’s stand united and stop this.”

Democrat U.S. Rep. Andre Carson, whose Indianapolis district is the only majority-minority district in the state and one Republicans are seeking to flip, appeared via video message. 
“I’m in D.C. working for you, but Trump and his allies want to tip the scale so Congress represents their interests, not ours,” he said in a prepared statement. “They want to erase Black, Latino and Asian voices, but we’ve fought for our rights before — and today, that fight continues.”
Braun officially called lawmakers back for a special session last week to consider redistricting after national Republicans urged GOP-controlled states to redraw congressional boundaries before 2026.
The Senate announced Monday that it will complete its legislative business by Dec. 12. The General Assembly will then reconvene again on Jan. 5 to resume the annual session.
But Harris said that when legislators reconvene later this month, it should be to tackle issues such as child care, housing and food security — not to redraw political lines.
“Hoosiers deserve maps that reflect who we are,” he said, “not political manipulation.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)I’m hopeful that Gov. Kevin Stitt’s selection of Oklahoma’s next Secretary of Education will be transformational.

In case you missed it, Stitt recently announced that his previous education secretary, Nellie Tayloe Sanders, would be stepping down. He said he’d appoint Daniel Hamlin, an academic with a higher education background, to serve in the role.
After rereading so much of Hamlin’s academic research about topics such as standardized tests, charter schools, chronic absenteeism, segregation and whether raising test-driven expectations has worked, I find myself impressed by his balance and nuance. He brings all sides into discussions about education.
While I suspect that he and I might disagree on an unknown number of things, Hamlin strikes me as an example of the social science we need to bring back to public education. I view his research as objective and neutral. I’m especially impressed by his commitment to responding to new evidence as it emerges.
Moreover, Hamlin leads The Leadership & Policy Center for Thriving Schools & Communities at the University of Oklahoma. The center promotes both traditional leadership models, and innovative practices for tackling entrenched social and educational problems. The center supports the team efforts necessary for addressing “student health and safety, family engagement, school climate,” and chronic absenteeism.
I read Hamlin’s Principal Conversation and Teacher Vitality: An Empirical Analysis in Low Performing Schools as the antithesis of the venture philanthropists’ approach to improving schools by blowing up the existing systems in the hope that transformative change will rapidly fix our schools.
In contrast to the corporate reformers’ mass firings, market-driven reformers repeatedly claimed that the problem with low-performing schools is that educators have “low expectations,” and accept “excuses” for poor student performance. Hamlin though documents the need for trusting relationships between administrators and teachers.
He noted how external pressure and control in high-challenge schools with unpredictable environments and intense work demands “can leave teachers in low-performing schools frustrated, exhausted, and depleted of authentic energy. Those conditions explain why low-performing schools are likely to have higher teacher turnover, lower qualified and less experienced teachers, and increased stress.”
These poor working conditions and teachers’ psychological distress are made worse when administrators engage in controlling conversations, or top-down, and compliance-oriented conversations designed to regulate teachers’ behaviors. When principals listen selectively in order to redirect teachers, the stress imposed on teachers is likely to spread to students.
On the other hand, when principals engage with teachers using Transformative leadership conversation with “deep listening, and affirming language to generate sensemaking and learning dialogue,” teachers benefit. As a result, students are more likely to be excited and interested in learning, increasing student performance.
Hamlin’s research, however, challenged the idea that creating the proper school culture can, by itself, solve chronic absenteeism.
In addition, he found that states which set high performance test standards have not been successful in increasing students’ outcomes by raising expectations. In 2017, Hamlin concluded, “the primary driving force behind raising the bar for academic proficiency is to increase academic achievement, and it appears that education leaders have not figured out how to translate high expectations into greater student learning.”
This is an especially important issue today when think tanks have convinced too many legislators that “proficiency” is “grade level,” meaning that as few as 13% of Oklahoma City Public School third grade students read at grade level.
But maybe the single most important issue where Hamlin will have to weigh in is the issue of school choice.
Hamlin tackles the question as to why charters tend to have greater parental involvement than public schools. Is it the result of the “preexisting attributes” that families bring to charter schools, or the cultures that charters cultivate? Hamlin concludes that school cultures are created by outside and inside influences.
Hamlin also cites evidence that charter schools have advantages because choice schools benefit from students from families that have socioeconomic advantages. They also benefit from “more effective and reliable social and professional networks.” This “challenges the idea that all students face a level playing field within a school choice system,” he found.
Hamlin has also offered proposed solutions regarding the increased segregation that school choice worsens. He’s written in support of new approaches that “might” influence school integration.  These schools, that Hamlin calls “equity-by-design” are relatively new, and “it is unclear how far reaching these schools can be in addressing racial and socioeconomic school segregation.” To be scaled up, they would “conceivably need to provide multiple supports to families.”
Given Oklahoma’s failure to invest in what it takes to provide equity for students in high-challenge neighborhood schools, it’s hard for me to conceptualize how we could invent charter systems that help reverse segregation by choice. On the other hand, charters are not going away, and Hamlin makes a good case that his plan could increase integration.
His approach reminds me of the early 1990s when the American Federation of Teachers supported charters, and before school privatizers launched their extreme attacks on public schools, teachers and unions. Back then, if someone like Hamlin brought his proposal to the table, I suspect we could have come together, and invested in equity-by-design schools.
Similarly, I’m betting that our new Secretary of Education could play a major role in terms of breaking free from a quarter of a century of attacks on holistic instruction for all, and build schools worthy of the 21st century and our children.

An estimated 3,529 households that have applied for assistance still await help with heating costs, though officials estimate the need is much higher.
The post Low-income Wyoming homes still without heating assistance as temperatures dive and federal shutdown drags on appeared first on WyoFile .","Temperatures are plunging across the Equality State, and thousands of low-income households are without heating assistance due to the federal government shutdown, now entering its fifth week.
The federally funded Wyoming Low Income Energy Assistance Program stopped approving new applications when its funding ran out Oct. 15, but continues to accept applications so that qualified candidates will receive help as soon as Congress approves a spending bill.
State LIEAP officials had OK’d assistance for 1,168 households before the pause on approvals, guaranteeing some level of reimbursement toward natural gas and electricity bills for the 2025-26 heating season, according to officials. However, the Wyoming Department of Family Services, which manages the LIEAP program, has received an estimated 3,529 applications since mid-October that cannot be approved until the federal government shutdown ends and the program receives an appropriation.
“Of those applications, 222 have indicated that they are in a crisis situation, such as running out of fuel or having their utilities disconnected,” DFS spokesperson Kelly Douglas told WyoFile via email on Monday.
“There is no way that my organization, with the level of need that is in this community, can make up for the absence of LIEAP.”Kelly Wessels, Community Action Partnership of Natrona County
The program assisted 8,236 households last season.
Local organizers who help those in need apply for LIEAP and other assistance say they’re flooded with inquiries. They’re concerned that the absence of heating cost help will compound hardships for already vulnerable Wyomingites.
“Being cold is hard,” Community Action Partnership of Natrona County Executive Director Kelly Wessels told WyoFile. “You can be subject to other illnesses, then you’re not eating because you don’t have access to supplemental food, and so you’re compromising people in multiple ways.
“People are scared,” she added.
Community Action Partnership and other local organizations are working hard to coordinate resources to help fill gaps in the absence of federal assistance, Wessels said, but there simply are not enough resources to meet the need.
“The request for my agency’s assistance has gone up exponentially,” Wessels said. “We have had an extreme turn up in individuals who normally would be served by LIEAP, particularly your seniors and your disabled, who are experiencing shutoff notices, who have been shut off and who are in desperate need of utility assistance.”
She added, “There is no way that my organization, with the level of need that is in this community, can make up for the absence of LIEAP.”

Wyoming LIEAP typically begins offering “crisis benefits” to qualified households to help avoid disconnections, fill empty propane tanks and provide fuel for wood- and pellet-stoves on Oct. 1. It begins reimbursement assistance for utility natural gas and electricity bills after Nov. 1.
Both renters and homeowners can qualify for the program, but must meet the income requirement of no more than 60% of the state median income level. The amount awarded is based on several factors, including energy needs, income and family size. The program prioritizes households with children 5 years old and younger, residents who are 60 and older, as well as residents who are disabled. 
The U.S. Senate reconvened Monday and is scheduled to vote Tuesday on a House-passed bill to reopen the federal government, according to national news outlets. Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barrasso, in a post on the social media platform X on Monday, continued to blame congressional Democrats for the shutdown.
In addition to Wyoming LIEAP, several utility companies that operate in the state provide home heating assistance via Energy Share of Wyoming, which is designed to help “people in hardship circumstances with energy related emergencies,” according to the organization’s website. But the program doesn’t typically begin accepting applications until Dec. 1. DFS is encouraging those in need of support with heating costs to continue to apply to the LIEAP program and to reach out to Wyoming 211 by dialing 2-1-1 for assistance determining qualifications and how to apply.

The state’s budget shortfall to build and fix roads keeps getting bigger, but lawmakers can’t find a stable revenue source, columnist Kerry Drake writes. 
The post Wyoming’s fear of tax increases puts our highway system in jeopardy appeared first on WyoFile .","Dear readers, can I briefly take you back to February 2014? I realize many of you might want to return there for real and stay, given the state of the world today, but I have a special reason for this imaginary time travel experiment.

Opinion

Things were looking pretty good for Wyoming then. The state had a budget surplus of $238 million heading into the legislative session, plus $1.7 billion banked in a “rainy day account.” Lawmakers had tackled a pretty big problem the year before by raising the state fuel tax by a dime per gallon.
Just like today, tax increases weren’t popular. But the 14-cent per gallon tax on gasoline and diesel was the lowest in the country and hadn’t been raised since 1998. In 2013, the state had about a $100 million shortfall for its highway construction and maintenance budget.


Legislators didn’t think they could raise the whole amount by increasing the fuel tax, but they passed a bill that got them part of the way. The dime-per-gallon hike to 24 cents brought in $47 million to build and fix state roads, $16 million for county roads, and $8 million for local roads and state parks.
In February 2014, the Wyoming Department of Transportation asked then-Gov. Matt Mead for $50 million from the general fund to catch up with its backlog of road-building and maintenance projects.
Mead was a strong supporter of the fuel tax increase the year before, which took some political courage. I recall it was the No. 1 area of criticism from voters and his opponents in his re-election campaign. 
But the governor balked at the Wyoming Department of Transportation’s $50 million request, which I saw as short-sighted given the state’s fiscal situation. This was my “Drake’s Take” after he told the department no:
“Given the importance to our economy and the health of our people in maintaining a safe roads system, the failure of our government to address our highway problems when we have the funds to do so is inexcusable.”
Let’s return to the present. I still agree with myself — I usually do — and contend that Wyoming’s decision not to invest in our highways when we’ve had opportunities to do so is the primary reason WYDOT is now facing a $400 million annual shortfall in state highway funding. That would be a big deal in any state, but let’s not forget Wyoming roads must withstand months of brutal winter conditions each year. Anyone who’s driven on an icy Wyoming road knows what’s at stake.
The Joint Transportation, Highways and Military Affairs Committee voted 7-5 against sponsoring a fuel tax increase. A working group developed a draft bill to raise the tax by a dime — 5 cents in 2026 and another nickel in 2028 — which was whittled down to just 5 cents, but that was still too much for the panel.

Someone may sponsor a bill during the upcoming legislative session, but in a budget year, which requires two-thirds support to be introduced, it has no chance. Even if it could make it past the far-right Freedom Caucus that controls the House, the notoriously anti-tax Senate would kill it.
There’s no way to accurately determine how much lower today’s WYDOT shortfall would be if the Legislature had been willing to pass another fuel tax hike since 2013, but I think it’s safe to say the figure wouldn’t have ballooned to $400 million a year.
In 2019, WYDOT’s highway budget was only $79 million underwater. A bill to index the fuel tax to the rate of inflation — a popular strategy in other states — died when it wasn’t assigned to a committee.
Wyoming lawmakers blew their chance to keep pledges not to raise taxes out of the political equation. Legislators wouldn’t need to explain their votes every year, because a variable-rate fuel tax structure would allow the state to automatically raise sustainable gas tax revenues long-term.
Even a three-cent-per-gallon increase the next year couldn’t pass, though its main proponent, then-Rep. Tim Hallinan, R-Gillette, promised it was so small “it won’t hurt anyone.” To no avail, he tried to explain that the 3 extra cents would at least allow the state to keep up with inflation through 2022, when the issue could be addressed again.
In the 2022 session, the Transportation Committee considered two proposals to boost highway funds, and only one was a tax increase.
The more conventional measure would have increased fuel taxes by 5 cents in each of the next three fiscal years. It would have raised an extra 
$22.5 million in FY 2023, $44.9 million in FY 2024 and $67.4 million in FY 2025. 
But it never got out of the starting gate as the House leadership wouldn’t hold a vote to introduce it.

The most intriguing, out-of-the-box suggestion was made by then-Rep. Jerry Obermueller, R-Casper. He convinced the Transportation Committee to sponsor a Senate bill to divert mineral severance tax monies that normally go to the Permanent Mineral Trust Fund and earmark them for highways ($60.9 million) and community colleges ($26.1 million).
That one did get an introduction vote but fell six votes short in the Senate.
Improving the state’s highway infrastructure is a goal that legislative leadership likes to claim as a priority, but the track record over the past dozen years proves it actually isn’t even on their radar.
So what happens next? Will Wyoming be staring at an $800 million highway budget shortfall by the end of the decade, or can the Legislature find a way — through fuel tax hikes or other means — to finally provide a stable revenue source?
After the latest fuel tax increase failed to get out of the Transportation Committee, Co-chair Sen. Stephan Pappas, R-Cheyenne, suggested lawmakers may be forced to cover highway costs with general fund dollars.
If the Legislature can’t find the political courage to raise taxes, implement an indexing system to cover inflation, or divert Permanent Mineral Trust Fund revenue streams to highways, the general fund may indeed be the only place to go. But there’s so much competition for those monies, I fear the highway funding crisis will continue to spiral out of control.
Remember our initial experiment, when we pretended to go back to February 2014? That relatively small $50 million WYDOT request denied by the governor would have come from the sacrosanct general fund, which was apparently too important to be raided for highways.
In my experience as a Wyoming-watcher, the state often repeats its mistakes or fails to recognize them as mistakes. If we don’t want to be remembered for having the nation’s most treacherous roads or biggest collection of potholes, we need to get our act together.

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)In February 2024, the Idaho Legislature debated a bill that would’ve probably repealed Medicaid expansion.
Without the program — which expanded the public assistance program to more low-income earners — John Barnes told lawmakers, “I may not be here.”
Only parts of that bill eventually made it into a sweeping Medicaid cost control law that passed this year.
But with all the cuts coming to Idaho Medicaid, Barnes said he still worries he’ll lose Medicaid. 
“When I do have chest pain or something, and go to the ER, and then I worry, ‘Is this gonna be the time they send me a bill that I can’t pay?’” he told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. 
The federal government shut down after a health care clash. In Idaho, the stakes are high.

In the coming weeks and years, a slew of cuts will hit Idaho Medicaid and health care: to doctor pay cuts, reforms from a state law this year, federal cuts from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” and potentially expiring insurance subsidies. 
And many advocates say everyone will be affected, not just the nearly 346,000 Idahoans on Medicaid. 
Advocates for hospitals, nursing homes and Medicaid patients paint a similar picture. The cuts, they say, will create a ripple effect that strains the state’s health care system — predicting more people will become uninsured, some medical providers might close, and private insurance rates will rise as hospitals try to offset the costs of caring for uninsured people.
“All of these cuts are creating this perfect storm,” said Idaho Voices for Children Senior Policy Associate Hillarie Matlock. “We’re going to see that access to care for every Idahoan go down.”

 The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ paved the way for Medicaid cuts Idaho wants

For years, Idaho Republican state lawmakers have wanted to control Medicaid’s rising budget, which is now at nearly $5 billion in mostly federal funds. 
In March, all 90 Republicans in the Idaho Legislature and Gov. Brad Little approved House Bill 345. The law proposed sweeping policy changes to rein in Medicaid’s costs — calling for work requirements for able-bodied adults on Medicaid expansion, private companies running benefits, and much more. 
But Idaho needs federal approval for many of those changes. In the past, the state didn’t succeed.
Months later, Republicans in Congress and President Donald Trump paved the way with the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” signed into law in July. 
The federal law overlapped with some of the Medicaid policies Idaho wanted, like work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks. But it prevents Idaho from paying providers as much for Medicaid services as state lawmakers had hoped to. 
It’s also the biggest Medicaid cut in the program’s history, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The law also created a $50 billion five-year rural health fund.
 As federal cuts build on Idaho’s, doctor says ‘people will die’

Over the next decade, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” is expected to cut federal funds for Idaho Medicaid by $4.3 billion and reduce Idaho Medicaid’s enrollment by as much as 40,000 people, estimates from the group Manatt show. Another 58,000 Idahoans are at risk of losing Medicaid expansion coverage because of the bill’s work requirements, Idaho Voices for Children estimates. 
“The bottom line is, people will die. And I can’t stand for that,” said Dr. Angela Bangs, a family doctor in Boise.

After she finished speaking at last week’s protest of the federal health cuts near the Idaho State Capitol, she joined a small crowd sitting in front of 80 numbered fake tombstones. The graves were meant to represent the number of Idahoans who will die each year from the cuts, based on a 2014 study of how health insurance access prevents deaths. 
The protest echoed what doctors said about the stakes of expanding Medicaid, and repealing it. 
Barnes, who told state lawmakers he would be dead without Medicaid, has been on Medicaid expansion since 2021, soon after he got out of prison. 
He still lives in a sobriety house in Boise. He works 16 hours a week, based on advice he said his doctor gave him. 
Lately, he’s had chest pains, shortness of breath, and his stomach hasn’t been digesting food well. He’s planning to go in for screenings, and probably an MRI.
“Are these procedures gonna be paid for?” Barnes said. “I gotta be able to afford it. I’m just scared that I’m not gonna be able to get the treatment.”
 Idaho will cut doctor Medicaid pay rates in weeks, which could prompt providers to close

In August, another cut came to Idaho Medicaid.
As the state’s tax revenues lagged, Gov. Little ordered budget cuts across state government, prompting Idaho Medicaid to cut provider pay rates by 4%. 
Those cuts could last until at least June 2027, as Little permanently extended state budget cuts. 
In the coming weeks, Idaho is planning to officially claw back those 4% pay cuts from payments, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter told the Idaho Capital Sun in an email.
Some health leaders worry the pay cuts will push providers to close. 
“I’ve never been concerned that one of our hospitals was going to close,” said Idaho Hospital Association Vice President for Government Relations Toni Lawson. “And I’m very nervous right now.” 
 Providers aren’t breaking even on many Medicaid treatments, hospital leader says

Medicaid, which insures around one-fifth of all Americans, already pays less than what it costs health care providers to give out services. 
As Idaho permanently extends governor’s budget cuts, Medicaid will keep provider pay cuts

Because providers are constantly not breaking even when they treat Medicaid patients, they’re often shifting the costs onto private insurance companies, Idaho Hospital Association CEO Brian Whitlock said. 
“Our health care system is built on a system of patches to address this issue of our starting point of an under-reimbursement; a reimbursement that doesn’t cover the cost to deliver that care,” he said, pointing to complicated state and federal financial structures to pay hospitals more than Medicaid reimburses.
“You don’t fix it by cutting more,” Whitlock said. “But that’s exactly the position that we find ourselves in.” 
Idaho long-term care facilities can’t cut staff pay, because they are already losing workers, Idaho Health Care Association Executive Director Robert Vande Merwe said. Their only way to offset the cuts is to cut staff, he said, and some rural facilities might close. 
That means people will probably be stuck at the hospital for longer, he said, because there’ll be less long-term care beds available. 
“When people stack up at the hospital and the hospital doesn’t get paid for weeks or months, we with insurance all pay for it. Because they will have to increase their private pay charges,” Vande Merwe said. 
That “just shows the fragility of our health care system,” he said.
 One of the first cuts coming is an end to 24/7 kids care

With all the Medicaid cuts coming, Dr. Brian Birch said he can’t grow his children’s health clinic.

In January, an Idaho Medicaid program that paid doctor’s offices to be available 24/7 to help consult kids about health issues will end. 
The program, called Healthy Connections, was meant to avoid unnecessary trips to the emergency room. The state’s Medicaid cost reform law cut it. 
He hopes the Legislature will restore the program next year. But for now, he’s playing it safe. 
“I can’t grow an organization with this much uncertainty and with these payment cuts because it puts us at extreme risk of going out of business,” Birch, who leads the Treasure Valley Children’s Clinic in Meridian, said in an interview.
Some doctor’s offices are more worried. 
Many might have to limit how many Medicaid patients they treat, and some may stop taking Medicaid altogether, according to a survey by the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Idaho chapter. At least two are “assessing the viability of remaining in business,” the survey found
 



 When each Medicaid cut and policy change takes effect: A timeline

Congress and President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” signed into law in July, and the Idaho Legislature’s House Bill 345, signed into law in March, made sweeping changes and cuts to Medicaid. And their policy changes had some overlap.
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare is “on track to submitting federal authority for all provisions of” the state law “on time as required by the law,” agency spokesperson AJ McWhorter told the Idaho Capital Sun in an email. 
Changes from the two laws will take effect over the next few years. 
Here’s some of what’s coming for Idaho Medicaid:

24/7 kids’ care ends: On Jan. 1, 2026, an Idaho Medicaid program that paid primary care doctors’ offices to have round-the-clock availability to manage kids’ health issues will end. Idaho’s law called for this to end. 
More eligibility checks: Starting Dec. 31, 2026, people enrolled in Idaho Medicaid expansion will need to start renewing their eligibility for the program more often, according to KFF. Eligibility checks will happen twice a year, instead of the typical once a year. Both the federal and state laws called for this change.
Work requirements: Starting as late as Jan. 1, 2027, people on Medicaid expansion will need to prove to state officials that they are working or volunteering at least 80 hours each month, or are exempt from the work requirements, according to the health policy research group KFF. Both the federal and state law called for Medicaid work requirements. But the federal bill set a firm deadline, while Idaho’s law directed the state to ask the federal government for permission by July 1, 2026. 
Private companies could run Medicaid benefits: By 2029, Idaho hopes to shift all Medicaid benefits to being run by private companies, which are commonly called managed care organizations. Idaho’s law called for this change, which is meant to stabilize Medicaid funds by shifting to managed care, the most common Medicaid structure across the U.S. The bill directed Idaho to end the state’s use of a managed care-like model in which doctors act as benefit managers, which is called value care. 
Co-pays: The timeline for Idaho to require people enrolled in Medicaid to essentially pay copayments, also known as cost sharing, is unclear. The state law called for this. The federal law called for cost-sharing for adults on Medicaid expansion starting Oct. 1, 2028, according to KFF. 


The impact of Idaho’s Medicaid reform law isn’t yet clear.
The law could save $15.9 million this fiscal year, the bill’s fiscal note estimated. But the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare isn’t sure how the bill will impact Idaho Medicaid costs and enrollment.
“The department is waiting on further guidance from” the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services “concerning work requirements and other law changes to define enrollment projections,” McWhorter told the Idaho Capital Sun in an email.

A company with connections to the cryptocurrency industry is considering drilling for natural gas near the Deep River north of Sanford in Lee County, North Carolina.
If approved, the project would be the first commercial well drilled into the Triassic Basin, a natural gas repository underlying North Carolina and other Eastern Seaboard states.
Deep River Data, based in Alamance County, is interested in accessing gas from Butler Well No. 3, just south of U.S. Highway 421 near the Lee-Chatham county line, according to emails obtained under public records law.
Company adviser Dan Spuller, who is both a crypto entrepreneur and a natural gas landman, contacted the state Oil & Gas Commission in September about applying for a drilling unit, a parcel of land where drilling would occur. He said the natural gas would be for a data center to power “AI workloads,” not crypto mining. Both applications are energy-intensive, running server farms around the clock to power streams of computer computations.
“We want to submit a packet that is complete on first impression—avoiding delays and making the Commission’s review as straightforward as possible,” Spuller wrote.
Duke Energy recently projected data centers could add nearly 6 gigawatts to demand in North Carolina, which has prompted the construction of new natural gas plants and pipelines, major sources of planet-warming methane and carbon dioxide.
Methane, which leaks upstream from well heads, pipelines and compressor stations, traps 86 times more heat over 20 years than carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas, which power plants emit when burning fossil fuels.
Nationwide, some data centers have not only tapped into the grid but revived shuttered coal and nuclear plants for their power. The Lee County project would tap into the natural gas reserves in the Deep River Basin, which spans 150 miles over 11 counties in central and southern North Carolina.
Spuller told Inside Climate News the company will use conventional drilling, rather than fracking, to produce the gas. Fracking is a particularly destructive type of extraction. It requires horizontal drilling beneath the ground and often uses toxic chemicals mixed with large volumes of water injected at high pressures to crack the shale formations and free the gas trapped within small fissures.
Fracking is legal in North Carolina, but has never been deployed. Lee County enacted two-year fracking moratoria in 2017 and in 2019; both have expired.
“We are evaluating whether the well can safely and efficiently produce gas using conventional methods,” Spuller said. “It remains in a pre-feasibility phase—we are still evaluating whether development is even viable. Nothing has been approved, permitted or built.”
Butler Well No. 3 was drilled vertically in 1998 to a depth of 2,655 feet, according to a 2011 report by the North Carolina Geological Survey. The well lies within a geological region of black shale and old coal deposits, a legacy of the area’s mining history.
“The Oil and Gas Commission must look carefully at this proposal to exploit the gas well near the Deep River, as well as those who want to develop it,” said Therese Vick of the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League. “It is incumbent on the commission to do its due diligence. Having worked with communities in Lee and Chatham Counties for over a decade, my concerns are many.”
In addition to Butler Well No. 3, there is a second natural gas resource in Lee County, known as Simpson Well No. 1, pictured here. Companies have also explored the gas in the Simpson Well, but it has not been commercially drilled. Credit: NC DEQ
Depending on their size, data centers can also consume enormous amounts of water to cool their computer servers. The project would be less than a tenth of a mile from the Deep River and Patterson Creek.
Spuller said water use “would be minimal” and that “there are no plans to withdraw water from the Deep River.”
The project could tap into groundwater or a public water main that runs along the north side of U.S. Highway 421.
The company is considering closed-loop systems and other sustainable options, he said. Some closed-loop systems, however, use more energy to run the coolers.
The project will likely need standard utility interconnections, Spuller said, such as electricity, fiber and “basic access roads typical of small-scale data facilities. There are no heavy-industrial or extraction components proposed.”
The state Geological Survey noted that Butler Well No. 3 is located within three and a half miles of a 6-inch distribution line to the Sanford Industrial Park, “which has large volume gas users.”
Stephanie Stephens, the Deep River Riverkeeper, said she’s concerned the project could be a harbinger of more data centers along the Carolina Core, an area that includes Sanford and is targeted for economic development.
“We would like to be choosy about the types of industry that come in,” she said.
The proposed data center would also be near the new Boone Trail kayak and canoe access site.
The Deep River is a troubled waterway. Nearly 23 miles are on the federal impaired waters list, and it contains 1,4-Dioxane, a likely carcinogen, discharged from the City of Asheboro’s wastewater treatment plant. Another 131 miles of tributaries to the river are also impaired, state records show.
“We already have a polluted river,” Stephens said.
Lee County records show Butler Well No. 3 is on a 643-acre forested tract owned by Ed Myrick of Pompano Beach, Florida. However, Dan Butler, who lives in Southern Pines, purchased the mineral rights beneath that property in 1975 from the previous land owner, Weyerhauser, the timber company.
Butler owns more than 2,700 acres of mineral rights in Lee County, state records show.
Since 1998, several companies have conducted exploratory drilling of Butler Well No. 3. However, given the comparatively small amount of gas and lack of a pipeline to transport it, they determined it wasn’t economically feasible and abandoned their projects.
Butler is a third-generation oil and gas developer. His grandparents were born in western Pennsylvania, where he owns “oil wells being drilled by the hundreds in the Alleghany State Forest,” according to a transcript of his comments at a 2012 Legislative Research Commission meeting.
Butler’s father, Howard, was the superintendent of the Coal Glen Mine in Chatham County in 1925 when it exploded and killed 53 men.
It’s uncertain whether the property, which currently allows residential and agricultural uses, would need to be rezoned. There are no provisions for data centers in Lee County’s current unified development ordinance, said County Zoning Administrator Thomas Mierisch. The UDO went into effect in 2006, before data centers and cryptomines “were really a thing,” Miersch said.
Spuller became a registered landman in North Carolina in 2021, according to state Department of Environmental Quality records. In this capacity Spuller can negotiate business agreements for exploration or development of natural gas.
Although Deep River Data officials also work for other cryptocurrency interests, Spuller said the project would not be a cryptomine. “It is envisioned as a modular data-infrastructure project” that would include AI workloads and other compute-intensive research, he said.
Deep River Data was incorporated on April 30, according to the North Carolina Secretary of State business registry. The company’s officers work in cryptocurrency: Spuller, Dan Fisher and Gerald Wilkie, Jr. A separate Wilkie-run enterprise, HM Tech, which operates out of a large, blue warehouse on South Maple Street in Graham, is listed as a “managing member” of Deep River Data.
HM Tech is a bitcoin mining facility and repair center. Two other top executives, Alun Williams and Murray Stahl, are with Horizon Kinetics, a New York-based investment firm whose funds include cryptocurrency.
Wilkie was among 55 cryptocurrency company representatives who signed a letter in 2022 to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan disputing the industry’s environmental harm. Two dozen congressional Democrats had previously sent a letter to Regan expressing their “serious concerns regarding reports that cryptocurrency facilities across the country are polluting communities and are having an outsized contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.”
Wilkie signed the letter in his role as founder and president of HMTech.
“There are no pollutants, including carbon dioxide, released by digital asset mining,” the cryptocurrency companies wrote. “Associated emissions are a function of electricity generation, which is a consequence of policy choices and economic realities shaping the nature of the electrical grid. Digital asset miners simply buy electricity that is made available to them on the open market, just the same as any industrial buyer.
“It is imperative that elected officials in the United States recognize that bitcoin … is the most important financial, economic, and accounting innovation in the history of humanity.”
Wilkie did not respond to an email and voicemail from Inside Climate News requesting an interview.
In addition to Deep River Data, Spuller is the executive vice president of industry a?airs for the Blockchain Association, headquartered in Washington, D.C. However, Deep River Data is separate from that work, he said.
Earlier in his career, Spuller worked as the communications director for former Republican Gov. Pat McCrory’s inaugural committee. Spuller parlayed that connection for a marketing position at the state Department of Commerce, according to his LinkedIn page, where he worked closely with the Office of the Commissioner of Banks to help negotiate and pass the North Carolina Money Transmitters Act of 2016.
Former Lt. Gov. Dan Forest appointed Spuller to the North Carolina Blockchain Initiative in 2019, where he was a co-chairman and member until this year. From 2016 to 2020, he led membership and growth at the Chamber of Digital Commerce.
On Oct. 20, Spuller, representing the Blockchain Association, and Eric Peterson, senior government affairs manager at Kraken Digital Assets Exchange, appeared before the first state House Select Committee on Blockchain and Digital Assets.
They were advocating for legislation favorable to stablecoin, which is considered less volatile than other types of cryptocurrency. It can also be used to transfer funds between different crypto tokens.

Spuller was urging the passage of House Bill 92, the North Carolina Digital Assets Investment Act. It would authorize the state treasurer to invest a portion of public funds in the digital assets, study employment employee investment options, and evaluate the creation of a state-level digital asset reserve.
This measure passed the House earlier this year, but is still waiting for Senate approval.
“Hopefully they will pass it because I think that would also send really a fantastic message to the global economy that our state’s open for business,” Spuller said. “There’s no reason not to pass that. That would be on my wish list.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AdobeStock-Crypto-Mining-44446865-scaled-1-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-11-04 06:18:25.791930

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht/Tennessee Lookut)The Tennessee Attorney General’s Office argued Monday against removing the National Guard from Memphis, claiming the governor has authority to mobilize them even without action by the legislature or local government bodies.
The claims countered a challenge in Davidson County Chancery Court by Democratic state lawmakers and Memphis officials who say Gov. Bill Lee violated state law and the Constitution by mobilizing troops for police work as part of the Memphis Safe Task Force.
Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Moskal did not decide Monday whether to grant an injunction that would remove the National Guard from Memphis. 
Moskal said several times in the hearing she has seen no written order from the governor to send troops to Memphis and had only heard about a press release to deploy National Guard personnel to Shelby County as part of the Memphis Safe Task Force, which was done following a memo by President Donald Trump.
Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, three state lawmakers, a Memphis City Council member and two Shelby County commissioners sued the state after Harris declared a state of emergency in Shelby County caused, in part, by the influx of inmates into the county’s judicial system.
Joshua Salzman, attorney with the Democracy Forward Foundation, which is representing the plaintiffs, told the court, “The governor’s unilateral decision to deploy troops to militarily occupy an American city is as unlawful as it is shocking.”
Tennessee lawmaker says AG omitted, altered Guard deployment opinions

The deployment is also “causing ongoing, irreparable injury to the plaintiffs and to their constituents” with Memphis’ streets being patrolled by soldiers, he said.
The Constitution allows National Guard troops to be deployed only in cases of rebellion or invasion, and those must be approved by the legislature and requested by the local governing body, he said. Salzman acknowledged Memphis has suffered from crime, but he said there was no sudden emergency that demanded the National Guard deployment, only a post by Trump on Truth Social.
Arguing the state’s case, Assistant Attorney General Cody Brandon claimed the court has no authority to stop the governor from deploying troops because he is the commander-in-chief of the state’s army and can determine when they should be used.
He also cast doubt on Harris’s claims that the Guard deployment is costing the state financially, because their mobilization is being funded by the federal government.
Brandon also said the Guard has helped the task force, a coalition of state and federal agencies led by the U.S. Marshals Service, make hundreds of arrests as a “force multiplier” to reduce violent crime, even though its main duty is patrolling streets.
The legal fight centers, in part, on whether the Tennessee National Guard is a “militia” or an “army.”
A Tennessee governor’s use of a militia is restricted under the state law and the state Constitution. 
State law constrains the governor’s use of a militia for civilian enforcement and requires cities and counties to request the governor’s deployment of the Guard. Neither Memphis city officials nor Shelby County officials have requested the National Guard. 
Brandon claimed that the National Guard is an “army,” not a militia, and therefore unrestrained by the restrictions set out in state law and the constitution.
Memphis is among a handful of American cities — Los Angeles, Portland and Chicago — that have seen a surge in federal law enforcement, including members of the National Guard, ostensibly to combat crime and apprehend immigrants without lawful status.  
Tennessee is the only affected state with its governor welcoming the federal presence.

A day earlier, Judge Terry Doughty, a Trump appointee – who in the past several months has split with the administration on some significant immigration-related cases – ruled that the government’s detention of Carlos Guerra Leon was unlawful because the federal government had previously agreed that he would not be subject to deportation for at least another year.
According to his attorneys, Guerra Leon came to the country at age 10, “after suffering abandonment and neglect at the hands of his father.” Two years later, in absentia and without his knowledge, a judge ordered him deported. But in late 2022, still in the United States, he was granted Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, a humanitarian program for undocumented immigrants “who have suffered parental abuse, neglect, abandonment, or similar mistreatment,” offering them a chance at permanent residence, Guerra Leon’s attorneys wrote in a court filing.

Because of a visa backlog, he could not immediately apply for a green card and was granted deferred action status, pausing his removal for four years. His status does not expire until December 2026.
Nevertheless, according to his attorneys, in early August,  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested him without a warrant while he was on his way to work in New York and transferred him to the Jackson Parish Correctional Center in Jonesboro, a privately managed immigration lockup where he has since been held.
Though the Trump administration this year stopped restricting deferred action under the Special Immigrant Juvenile Status program, that doesn’t impact people who had already been granted deferred action, Guerra Leon’s attorneys argued. Doughty agreed.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and ICE “fail to cite any authority that allow the removal of Petitioner when deferred action status is still in effect,” Doughty wrote in his decision last week. “This Court holds that without terminating Petitioner’s deferred action status, Petitioner cannot be removed.”
ICE did not respond to requests for comment.
Following Thursday’s order, attorneys at the National Immigration Project and the ACLU of Louisiana rushed to Jonesboro to pick up their client.
In court documents filed early Friday morning, his attorneys said when they arrived at the detention center at about 10 p.m. on Thursday, facility staff refused to release the young man to them outside of the hours of 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., despite Doughty’s order for immediate release. Attorneys filed a motion to hold the Trump administration, including New Orleans-based ICE officials, in contempt of court.
Attorneys were finally able to take Guerra Leon with them on Friday morning, making the five-hour drive from Jonesboro to the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport in Kenner, where he caught an evening flight to be reunited with his family in New York.
At the airport, Guerra Leon remained mostly silent, at moments flashing a shy, nervous smile through round cheeks, as attorneys presented travel documents to the airport’s Transportation Security Administration staff. During the screening process, Bridget Pranzatelli, staff attorney at the National Immigration Project, rested a hand on Guerra Leon’s back or whispered encouragement to keep him calm.
Waiting to go through the security checkpoint, Guerra Leon smiled as he took a call from his mother Daysi Guerra Leon. He said he was most looking forward to reuniting with her.
Once attorneys escorted Guerra Leon to the airport gate, Pranzatelli texted Daysi Guerra Leon she would see her son soon.

Sears,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/11/04/moore-forges-ahead-with-redistricting-effort-announcing-advisory-commission/,Maryland's Democratic governor is moving forward with an effort to redraw the state's congressional districts despite opposition from a key legislative leader of his own party.,"The eight current congressional districts in Maryland could look a lot different after a new panel appointed by Gov. Wes Moore completes its work. What is unclear is if lawmakers will be called into a special session to consider a mid-cycle redistricting bill. Maryland Matters illustration.Maryland’s Democratic governor is pressing forward with an effort to redraw the state’s congressional districts, despite opposition from a key legislative leader of his own party.
Gov. Wes Moore (D), in a statement released to Maryland Matters, announced the formation of a five-member Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission, to be led by U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.). It is the latest move to redraw Maryland’s eight congressional districts with an eye toward eliminating the last Republican district.
“My commitment has been clear from day one — we will explore every avenue possible to make sure Maryland has fair and representative maps,” Moore said in the statement. “This commission will ensure the people are heard. I thank those who have raised their hands to lead this process, and I am confident in their ability to gather the views and perspectives of a broad range of voices throughout the state.”
Moore said the commission is charged with making recommendations to the governor and General Assembly on improving how the state’s eight congressional districts are drawn and ensuring “fair” congressional maps.
Those claims aside, the effort is part of a national battle for control of the House of Representatives before the 2026 midterm elections.
Maryland, like other states, redraws its congressional district lines every 10 years, following the decennial Census reports on population shifts.
But Texas, at the urging of President Donald Trump (R), redrew its districts earlier this year to make the map more friendly to GOP candidates next year. Other red states followed with mid-decade redistricting, and Democratic leaders in blue states have responded in kind.
California voters on Tuesday could move toward a map that would add five Democratic seats. Other states – including Maryland — are under pressure to follow suit. House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) has been calling Maryland lawmakers to press the issue, along with longtime Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th).

Alsobrooks will lead a five-member panel that includes former Attorney General Brian Frosh and Cumberland Mayor Ray Morriss, all appointed by Moore. Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) and House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) or their designees would round out the commission.
“We have a president that treats our democracy with utter contempt. We have a Republican Party that is trying to rig the rules in response to their terrible polling,” Alsobrooks said in the statement from Moore’s office. “Let me be clear: Maryland deserves a fair map that represents the will of the people. That’s why I’m proud to chair this commission. Our democracy depends on all of us standing up in this moment.”
Currently, seven of Maryland’s eight congressional districts are held by Democrats. As recently as two decades ago, those eight seats were split evenly among the two parties in a state where registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans 2-1.
Moore said last week that he continues to consider calling a special legislative session to take up the issue of redistricting ahead of the 2026 General Assembly session, but Tuesday’s announcement makes no mention of a special session.
Such a session would come despite opposition in the Senate to any mid-decade redistricting plan.
The announcement Tuesday is the latest in a political standoff between Moore, a rising star in national Democratic politics, and Ferguson over redistricting. Ferguson said last week he opposes mid-cycle redistricting and said it could backfire on Democrats.
“Simply put, it is too risky and jeopardizes Maryland’s ability to fight against the radical Trump Administration. At a time where every seat in Congress matters, the potential for ceding yet another one to Republicans here in Maryland is simply too great,” he wrote in a confidential letter sent to his 34-member Democratic Caucus.
The legislature approved the current congressional map in 2022. The next one would normally be approved in 2032, after the 2030 Census.
The governor’s announcement highlighted a division within his own party. While Ferguson is opposed, Jones, the House leader, appears ready to join Moore.
Moore said his commission follows a model used by Gov. Martin O’Malley in 2011. The panel, which is expected to meet this month, will solicit public feedback on the state’s current congressional maps and make recommendations, which could lead to legislation and a special session.
But where O’Malley’s committee held a dozen meetings over three months, Moore’s panel simply does not have that kind of time.

There’s roughly 10 weeks until the start of the 2026 legislative session on Jan. 14. Besides the looming holidays, many lawmakers are expected to take part in panels at the Maryland Association of Counties winter conference from Dec. 10-12.
A special session, if there is to be one, could fall around the first week of December, after lawmakers return from Thanksgiving and before the end of the year holiday lull.
Redistricting could have the potential to upend the state elections process.
Currently, the filing deadline for candidates is Feb. 24. New congressional maps would have to be approved in time to allow candidates to file in the appropriate districts. Map changes might require lawmakers to push back the primary election scheduled for June 23.
Federal law requiring ballots be mailed to overseas voters 45 days before the election will limit how late a primary can be held. And Maryland’s Nov. 3 general election cannot be changed. Those ballots will be mailed Sept. 19. Prior to that mailing, ballots must be certified and printed.
That sets up a scenario where the latest a primary election could be held is late July or early August — peak vacation season.
Further complicating matters are the almost inevitable state and federal court challenges that could delay implementation of the new districts.
And the possibility of a referendum challenge could also delay the maps. If lawmakers opt to pass new maps using emergency legislation, a referendum challenge would not become effective until after the primary.
And while the probability of a successful referendum challenge is low, should opponents succeed against the emergency bill, the consequences could be severe. The successful challenge would likely invalidate the map under the challenged law and could leave Maryland without congressional representation pending new maps and a special primary and general election.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)In 2023 and 2024, Tennessee lawmakers passed back-to-back multibillion-dollar tax cuts for businesses, pushing the state to rely even more on its sales tax to fund government spending.
Nearly every state economist who presented to the Tennessee funding board Monday noted this tax burden shift as officials considered how to project the state government’s future budget. 
“We are more dependent on sales tax than historically we have been,” said Jeff Bjark, the director of research with Tennessee’s Department of Revenue, to the board.
Tennessee is one of the lowest-taxed states in the nation, according to a 2024 report from the think tank ThinkTennessee. But the same report also found that in Tennessee, lawmakers have steadily shifted more of the tax burden from corporations to people, resulting in low-income families having a “higher tax burden than wealthier families and businesses.”
Sales taxes are considered “regressive” taxes and under the state’s sales tax-heavy system, low-income families pay a higher proportion of their income in taxes than any other income group, ThinkTennessee found. 
Nearly two-thirds of Tennessee’s $21 billion tax revenue comes from sales tax. The state’s average sales tax rate of around 9.6% is the second-highest rate in the U.S., according to the Tax Foundation.
Tennessee business tax reductions put onus on sales tax revenue

Don Bruce, a professor of economics at the Boyd Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Tennessee, told the board that its business tax collections would continue to fall this year as the government adjusted to the corporate tax cuts.
Joseph Newhard, an assistant Professor of Economics at East Tennessee State University, said the business tax cut situation provided “uncertainty,” making it difficult to project how far the revenue would fall. 
Tennessee’s funding board meets every November to hear an update of the state’s economy from academics and federal and state officials. The board is tasked with using that information to project how much revenue the state will generate in future years, the first step in Gov. Bill Lee’s 2025-26 budget. It  will make an official projections on Nov. 24.
Overall, the economists were optimistic about Tennessee’s outlook, noting that the state continued to outpace the U.S. average in gross domestic product growth and had lower unemployment than the national average. 
All the economists acknowledged concerns about President Donald Trump’s tariffs, but noted the tariffs have yet severely impacted Tennessee’s economy.

Staff and volunteers worked through a typical lunch break to meet demand, maneuvering shopping carts full of food to their awaiting recipients. By the end of the day, the food bank served about 2,200 people, according to Weston Edmunds, the food bank’s director of marketing and communications.
Half said they were impacted by the SNAP funding pause.

Angel Rojas came with her mother and 3-year-old son to pick up food, which included frozen meat, a 2-pound bag of rice, bottles of fruit punch and various produce. Rojas said she typically receives about $600 per month in SNAP benefits at the beginning of the month and tends to make a trip to the food bank later in the month when that money is gone.
She has seven children, and the ones in public school are getting breakfast and lunch through the state’s universal school meal program, but she worries about how to provide enough for everyone without SNAP.
“How am I going to make ends meet for the holidays? What bills will I have to skip to make sure there is food in the fridge for the kids?” she said.
Approximately 600,000 Coloradans rely on SNAP benefits each month, and advocates expect many of those people to turn to local food banks to get groceries. That will put increased demand on an already stressed system.
“SNAP is a really important safety net. We’re supposed to be the safety net to that safety net, but then it just disappeared,” said Monica Buhlig, the chief impact officer for Food Bank of the Rockies.

Court orders
The Trump administration announced in late October that it would not fund SNAP in November due to the ongoing federal government shutdown.
On Friday, however, two federal judges in separate rulings ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to use money in contingency funds to pay for the program during the shutdown. The Trump administration said Monday that it would partially fund SNAP, but it is not clear when that money will trickle down to individual people. It could be weeks.
The government shutdown began Oct. 1 and has persisted into November as U.S. Senate Democrats and Republicans have failed to agree on a short-term spending measure.

– Angel Rojas, at the Weld Food Bank


Haysel Hernandez, a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Human Services, said the state will issue payments “as rapidly as possible” once they get federal guidance. That guidance could include a requirement to recalculate how much each household is eligible to receive.
“In circumstances where the federal government provides a full month of funding, we anticipated that the issuance of payments would take up to 10 days. However, as the compliance report indicates that (the federal government) will be making partial payments, CDHS will need to implement certain system modifications to process the correct amounts,” she wrote in an email.
‘I’m scared’
Food banks across Colorado saw new clients from atypical demographics over the weekend, Buhlig said.
“People are really looking to find food, not knowing all the resources available to them, and just trying to find food where they can,” she said. “What I’m keenly aware of is that when you’re new to the system, navigating geography, different hours of operation, different days of the week is complex.”

Sarah Temple frequented the Weld Food Bank when her 9-year-old daughter was first born but has relied on SNAP in recent years to supplement her income. She said she receives a little over $900 per month for herself and three children.
“When I found out the SNAP thing was going to happen, I didn’t know what I was going to do. And then the food just dwindled down in my freezer, so now I’m here,” she said.
Temple recently lost her job and plans to rely on her church’s food pantry this month as well.
“When we have our SNAP benefits, we go to Costco and stock up. It can last two months with meat, vegetables and ice cream once in a while for the girls if we can afford it,” she said. “But now I’m scared to the point where I can’t even talk.”
Last week, the state’s Joint Budget Committee approved up to $10 million in extra funding for the state’s food banks. State leaders are also encouraging people to donate directly to Feeding Colorado at feedingcolorado.org/donate.

Wilson, who works out of the foodbank’s Lewiston office, is among the thousands within the nonprofit world who are trying to clean up what the politicos in Washington are doing – or in this case – not doing. She’s working with some 400 nonprofit partners in the Gem State to get the word out about where people can find food. In the short term, the foodbank’s supply is stable, and assistance is available for those who need it.
How long that stability lasts is another question.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has sent notice that as of Nov. 1, benefits under Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the food-stamp program) will be disrupted. SNAP helps more than 132,000 people in the Gem State with groceries every month.
SNAP has taken a hit on multiple fronts. The Big Beautiful (budget) bill that was passed by Congress shifts some of the SNAP funding from the federal government to the states, which could take $4 million, and perhaps more, from the general fund. That news comes at a time when Idaho lawmakers are considering what to do about the state’s budgetary shortfall. Wilson can easily justify the need.


Find food assistance in Idaho

Listings on the site include the phone number, as well as the days and hours that the specific food pantries are open. Call ahead to confirm hours of operation.


“There is no way that foodbanks can make up for the loss of funding from SNAP,” she says. “For every one meal served by a foodbank, there are nine served by SNAP.”
But a delay with SNAP is not the only issue at the forefront of the shutdown, according to a memo from Randy Ford, president and CEO of the Idaho Foodbank.
“In addition to SNAP, payroll for 11,000 federal workers (including active military) across Idaho may be affected,” he said. “This ripple effect will be felt throughout our local economies, food pantries and health care systems. The longer the shutdown lasts, the more families will feel the strain. We are preparing to handle an increase in need and are hoping for a resolution soon.”
If news reports are accurate, Republicans and Democrats are nowhere close to ending the political stalemate.
“The shutdown is coming at a time when people are struggling. We had 4,000 visits a month to our food locaters – people who are trying to find ways to get help. And it’s not easy for Idahoans, who are proud people, to ask for help,” says Wilson.
“And this isn’t people who are homeless, or refusing to work,” she says. “In Idaho, there are so many good people who are working, but struggling to make ends meet. Forty-one percent of Idahoans fall into that category. People can be doing all the right things and still struggle.”
Food banks were ‘operating on fumes’ even before SNAP chaos

It’s no wonder why, with $400,000 being a benchmark for “low-cost housing” and anything under $2,000 a month being the measure for “affordable” rent. Then there are the unexpected medical costs, higher costs for groceries and gas and education expenses.
Now, we’re in the midst of a government shutdown where some people who are living paycheck-to-paycheck suddenly are not getting paid or, worse yet, are deemed “essential” and are forced to work without pay.
Of course, that’s not the problem of the folks who have decided that shutting down the government is preferable to working out their differences. Members of Congress continue to get paid.
“This is not about politics, it’s about people,” Wilson says. She’s correct, and Ford has his eyes in the right direction.
“At the Idaho Foodbank, we are already taking proactive steps to ensure no one goes hungry,” he says. “With the help of supporters, we are mobilizing our network of over 400 partner pantries, securing fresh, nutritious food and preparing to meet a rising demand for assistance.”
Good for the Idaho Foodbank and all that the people there do.

Patrick Morrisey probably thought he was doing something good to help people who will not receive their SNAP benefits because of the ongoing government shutdown.

Patrick Morrisey announces that the state will donate another $2.5 million to the state's two food banks on Friday, Oct. 31, 2025 in Charleston, West Virginia. (Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Gov. Patrick Morrisey probably thought he was doing something good to help people who will not receive their SNAP benefits because of the ongoing government shutdown.
The state had found $13 million that “had come in from the COVID era and that had been sitting there” that it could donate to the state’s two food banks, he said. However, instead of just giving that money to the food banks, he “challenged” residents to donate money as well, and said the state will match the funds up to $13 million.
“West Virginians in the past have shown that they come together during times like this,” Morrisey said. “We take care of our neighbors. We roll up our sleeves. We get things done. So today, I’m calling on all of us across West Virginia — individuals, families, businesses, people who care about the needy in our state, to step up. 
“We want to come together, and we want to help the people who might need that assistance or not be able to gain access to their SNAP benefits.” 
Yeah, West Virginians come together when our water has been poisoned and flooding has destroyed homes. We come together when there’s natural disasters and chemical spills. And I’m sure there are amazing people already donating, and will continue to do so even after the state chips in. Such people already help to keep our food banks stocked. 
But why is he asking taxpayers to donate more money in order to free the money we’ve already paid in taxes? Why is he holding our money hostage? 
Helping the hungry shouldn’t be treated like a pledge fund drive.
The West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy sent out an action alert last week stating that while they appreciate Morrisey committing additional funding, “food banks can’t replace the nearly $50 million” in SNAP funding that helps feed about 275,000 West Virginians — that’s 16% of our population. 
Who does Morrisey think will donate? The 275,000 people who use SNAP benefits? Or the approximately 22,900 federal employees who are currently working without pay?
In previous shutdowns, the the Department of Agriculture used funds to keep SNAP running, but had refused to do so this time, leaving states in a hard place. To be fair, Morrisey isn’t the only governor asking his constituents to help since the federal shutdown threatened funding for the federal food assistance programs. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, activated his state’s disaster relief fund, typically used for hurricanes and floods. He said the state legislature would need to reconvene to appropriate the state’s surplus tax revenues and reserves. But other governors, Democrats and Republicans, are managing to take a more proactive approach.
California has set aside $80 million in state funds, and in Minnesota, the state will divert $4 million to food pantries. 
Nevada will send $38.8 million to its food banks, and Louisiana is going to use $150 million monthly to help continue to provide SNAP benefits for its residents. 
In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said she would “fast-track” $30 million in state emergency food assistance to supplement SNAP benefits.
In Virginia, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency, meaning the commonwealth can use its own funds to temporarily pay for SNAP benefits.
While food banks are a wonderful resource, one reader emailed us and mentioned one drawback.
“Not to be ungrateful, but food banks offer lots of nutritionally unhealthy food,” they wrote. “SNAP benefits allow me to choose wisely.”
On Oct. 23, Morrisey announced he expedited $1.1 million to the state’s food banks in anticipation of the delayed SNAP benefits. On Wednesday, he posted on X that the state gave the food banks an additional $5 million to prepare for the Nov. 1 cutoff. Then Friday, he announced that the state gave an additional $2.5 million, bringing the total up to $8.6 million — more than half of the $13 million available.
But perhaps some of the state’s $338 million surplus could help temporarily fund some SNAP benefits. Or some of the $1.39 billion in the Rainy Day Fund? The state has used the money in the past to help with flood relief, so why not stop hunger?
Morrisey, asked if the state would give the entire amount if private donors didn’t raise $13 million, posted his answer on X.
“We believe we will provide the whole $13 million regardless of how many private sector dollars come in, unless the government opens right away and the money isn’t needed. However, we really want to stretch these state monies and raise private sector donations to provide a much greater cushion for people in need. If some portion of the state’s $13 million is matched, that will provide much more relief to people who are hungry for a longer period of time. $20-25 million will provide people benefits for a number of weeks.”
That money already isn’t being used, and food banks always need donations. It’s not possible to donate more than needed to a food bank.
West Virginia is already an unhealthy state. Food insecurity — being worried about running out of food before there’s money for more — can cause real medical issues, like diabetes and high blood pressure. Research has found a link between food insecurity and delayed development in children, as well as asthma, anemia, hyperactivity, anxiety and aggression. A study found food insecurity in pregnancy is associated with medical complications such as preeclampsia, preterm birth and NICU admission. 
Making sure West Virginia’s food banks are appropriately stocked is the least you can do, Governor. Ask them how much money they need each week, and find that money. Don’t let West Virginians starve.

Ever since Franklin Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law 90 years ago during the depths of the Great Depression, the political right has relentlessly derided and sought to undermine anti-poverty programs of all kinds.
Some of this effort – think of Donald Trump and the brigands on the make with whom he surrounds himself – is just plain old, run-of-the-mill greed. As they see it with crude, near-term accuracy, less money going to aid average Americans leaves more for them to plunder.
For others, the reasoning is weirdly and perversely ideological. This is the self-described “libertarian” crowd that clings stubbornly to the delusional notion that helping average Americans to remain middle class through public structures and systems somehow cultivates indolence and immorality. Think of Ronald Reagan’s fairy tales about “welfare queens” and the efforts of groups like the Heritage Foundation and John Locke Foundation to oppose everything from Medicaid to subsidized school lunches.
Both of these patterns are on stark display right now at the national level in the ongoing effort to decimate the Affordable Care Act and SNAP food assistance.
Meanwhile, here in North Carolina – a place where the legislature’s Republican majority long fought Medicaid expansion tooth and nail and has slashed everything from public education to affordable housing to aid for hurricane victims – the latest target is, of all things, a modest program that funds legal aid programs known as IOLTA.
As NC Newsline’s Brandon Kingdollar reported recently, IOLTA — is an ingenious system devised decades ago and employed across the country in which the separate bank accounts that attorneys long maintained to hold client funds in trust for brief periods (and that did not generate meaningful interest on their own) were instead pooled into a single large account that generates millions of dollars each year for the public purpose of funding legal aid.
It’s an inventive, win-win tactic that helps tackle an outsized societal need without using public tax dollars – the dearth of attorneys available, willing and capable of helping the millions of North Carolinians who need, but cannot afford, civil (as opposed to criminal) legal assistance. Think of women seeking to escape domestic violence, consumers ripped off by loan sharks, tenants illegally locked out of their homes, people with mental and physical disabilities denied services to which they are entitled, and hourly workers wrongfully underpaid by their employers who would, ordinarily, have no chance of finding a lawyer willing to take their cases. Rural “legal deserts” are among the areas that benefit the most.
Unfortunately, for the thousands of people of modest means who benefit from them, IOLTA funding and legal aid programs more generally have always been a bee in the bonnet of the political right. Not only does legal aid for people of low income offend their notions of societal order and “merit,” they do something that makes many conservatives even crazier: they fund lawyers who can occasionally win important legal and policy reforms. Think of a class action suit to validate the rights of a group of underpaid farmworkers or, God forbid, lawyers representing the rights of immigrants facing deportation.
And so it is that Republicans at the North Carolina legislature – with the assent of their most reliable of rubber stamps, state Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul Newby – recently enacted a law to bar the state IOLTA program from making grants during the current fiscal year that commenced July 1.
As a result, millions of dollars that would have gone to support legal aid programs – programs that even under the best of circumstances operate on a shoestring and are able to handle only a tiny fraction of the eligible clients who seek their help – are frozen. The cuts are already having a big and destructive impact. Last month, Legal Aid of North Carolina – one of IOLTA’s biggest grant recipients – announced it was closing offices in two of the state’s neediest communities: Rocky Mount and Pembroke.
In defense of their action, the legislative authors of the funding freeze have dredged up the old chestnut long employed by legal aid opponents that IOLTA funds have been funneled to “leftist groups with leftist ideologies.” It’s the same bogus claim made by those who would defund environmental protection and mental health programs because the professionals they employ tend to – surprise, surprise! – identify with the plight of their clients.
What’s more, as is made plain in a pair of powerful recent letters authored by Supreme Court Justices Anita Earls and Allison Riggs and a coalition of dozens of the state’s most prominent private attorneys, this claim is utterly specious. As the letters explain, IOLTA funding for civil legal aid is a critical component in the construction and maintenance of a well-functioning legal system, and the freeze will do much to undermine that cause.
The bottom line: in a nation in which the yawning gap between the wealthy and everyone else continues to metastasize, the IOLTA freeze is just the latest broadside in a longstanding and hugely destructive war on the poor.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/gavel-scales-getty-1024x6831761066498_LEGAL-AID-Logo.jpg,,,2025-11-04 06:18:25.791930

Belying Colorado’s mountainous reputation are millions of acres of farmland, blanketing nearly half of Colorado’s land area. Most of that land is dedicated to the production of cattle and calves, Colorado’s biggest cash crop.
That’s why President Donald Trump’s efforts to increase beef imports from Argentina may hit Colorado so hard. The president is raising the tariff rate quota for Argentinian beef from 20,000 to 80,000 metric tons, allowing four times as much Argentinian beef into the U.S. at low tariff rates. Trump claims that this will lower the cost of beef for American consumers as well as benefit his friend, Javier Milei, president of the economically struggling Argentina. But not only is Trump’s “win-win” logic flawed, his rhetoric masks the real winners and losers of this deal: corporations and American cattle producers.

The multibillion-dollar corporations monopolizing the American beef industry are set to profit from Trump’s Argentinian beef imports. JBS, Cargill, National Beef and Tyson (the “Big Four”) control 80% to 85% of the U.S. beef industry. The Big Four finish, process and package beef that they purchase from independent cattle producers.
Corporate consolidation in the industry has suppressed competition, and as a result the Big Four can dictate contract terms with cattle ranchers and farmers and shape the market, often illegally. Time and time again, the Big Four have been sued for suppressing production, increasing beef prices, and lowering payments to ranchers — they’ve paid 10s of millions of dollars to settle price fixing and conspiracy suits.
One result of corporate consolidation: Cattle producers earn on average only 30 cents for each dollar of beef sold in the U.S., down from 60 cents in 1990. More than half of cattle producers in the U.S. have gone out of business since 1980. 


The stranglehold that JBS, Cargill, Tyson, and National Beef have on the American beef industry isn’t just detrimental to cattle producers. The Big Four have a harrowing record of environmental and labor violations with implications for the entire country. From child-labor scandals in JBS slaughterhouses, to Tyson dumping millions of pounds of toxic waste into American rivers and lakes, to Cargill selling burgers tainted with E. coli in major U.S. supermarkets — these companies treat regulatory fines as a cost of doing business, rather than cleaning up their act. 
Perhaps most egregious is the climate impact of these companies. They emit enormous amounts of methane, a superheater greenhouse gas responsible for about one-third of global warming since the industrial revolution. JBS alone emits more methane than Shell and Exxon combined. The Big Four are roasting the planet, polluting our environment, and harming workers and America’s independent cattle producers to boot. 


Tough economic conditions for American cattle producers, combined with severe climate change-induced drought, and a cattle-parasite outbreak have contributed to record-low herd sizes in the U.S. and high beef prices for consumers. And while the higher beef prices don’t seem to be curbing demand among American consumers, they are a lifeline for U.S. cattle farmers after a stretch of bad years, allowing them to finally pay off some debt.
Cheap imports from abroad will undercut cattle producers, allowing the Big Four meatpackers to pay less for cattle. In fact, the announcement of the lower tariff rate quota has already hurt cattle prices for producers. That’s why President Trump’s efforts to increase beef imports sparked outrage among American cattle producers and instigated a bipartisan delegation of Colorado legislators to oppose the tariff-rate quota increase. 


In addition to harming cattle producers, increasing imports of Argentinian beef is unlikely to benefit consumers. Lower tariffs will reduce production costs for the Big Four, but that won’t necessarily translate to lower prices in grocery stores. More likely, the Big Four’s profit margins will increase, allowing them to take home whatever “savings” Trump promises to the American public.


Ultimately, raising the tariff rate quota for Argentinian beef reveals Trump’s loyalties. He’s supporting Milei and the Big Four — but consumers and cattle producers? Not so much.

Voters in Hinds County also will elect a coroner, choosing from a crowded field of six candidates.
​​A federal three-judge panel ordered Mississippi to conduct special elections for 14 legislative seats this year because the court determined the Legislature diluted Black voting strength when it redrew legislative districts.
The federal panel specifically ordered the state to have special elections for House districts in the Chickasaw County area, Senate districts in the Hattiesburg area and Senate districts in the DeSoto County area.

Four seats are not contested, which means only one candidate filed paperwork to run in the race. Candidates in three of the elections faced contested primary elections, but not a contested general election. But seven races related to redistricting are contested in the general election: six in the Senate and one in the House.
No matter the outcome of Tuesday’s races, Republicans will still retain control of both chambers of the Legislature when lawmakers convene in January for their 2026 session. However, national Democratic organizations are hoping to end the GOP’s two-thirds supermajority control of the state Senate.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Kipp is a former chef who found himself in a Nashville shelter for homeless men after health issues made it impossible for him to continue to work and pay his rent. He was eventually hospitalized and nearly died before slowly climbing his way out of homelessness with the help of service providers who linked him with a housing choice voucher.
I met Kipp while I was following several peoples’ journeys from homelessness to housing for a monthly radio show/podcast I co-produce for Nashville Public Radio called In My Place, which shows that most people we see on our streets are unable to access housing on their own.  
He’s one of thousands of Tennesseans who could be affected by planned federal funding changes to the Continuum of Care (CoC) program —  which allocates homelessness dollars to designated geographic areas in which stakeholders collaborate to build a homeless crisis response system — that were leaked to Politico, a national news outlet.
Tennessee, which has a shortage of more than 127,000 rental units for extremely low-income households, currently receives $43.8 million in federal funding that goes to local service providers who work on ending homelessness. Under the proposed federal changes, local housing programs are at stake, and people like Kipp could lose their housing supports.
The CoC Program is managed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which dictates how these funds are used.
The CoC Program awarded roughly $3.6 billion to CoCs nationwide for the current year. Of those funds, about 87% are dedicated to permanent housing programs and support services. According to Politico, HUD plans to cap this funding allocation for permanent housing programs to 30%.
There is also a possibility that HUD will cut the overall CoC Program funding by about half and shift the remaining program dollars toward temporary housing, which includes emergency shelters and temporary housing.
While we need more dollars for shelters and other temporary units, without also offering more permanent housing, we will create a bottleneck, and eventually more people will spill out onto our streets and into encampments.

Last winter, I met Denny, a 70-year-old man who was sleeping in a Nashville park, but was displaced due to renovations to the outdoor shelter he used. He was legally blind and could not find his way around in another location or in a mass shelter.
Several of us were able to make connections, and his case manager helped him move into a temporary apartment he now shares with others. Thanks to being in that temporary program, he was able to access health services to get the needed eye surgery that enabled him to see again. 
Cutting the CoC Program will limit options for people like Denny, who are not even receiving rental assistance yet. Hundreds of Tennessee seniors rely on the continuation of federal rental assistance programs, or they will be forced to choose between paying for medication, food or rent.
Housing inventory data collected annually by HUD for each of Tennessee’s CoCs shows that 7,469 beds were considered as permanent housing in 2024, or about 5,203 households.
About 3,300 households are placed in permanent supportive housing programs, which offer ongoing rental assistance for people like Kipp and Denny who have disabling conditions.
If those permanent supportive housing programs are capped at 30%, more than 2,300 Tennessee households could be tossed out of their homes by this looming funding change. 
The worst part is that with a renewed focus on forcing people who are homeless and have a disabling condition, such as a mental illness, into treatment facilities or jails, we’ll waste a ton of money.
The federal CoC-funded permanent housing programs are significantly more cost-effective compared to incarceration or a hospital stay. A permanent supportive housing program for people with severe and persistent mental illness costs about $80 per day. In comparison, a jail stay in Davidson County costs $115 per night, and an inpatient psychiatric bed at East Tennessee Behavioral Health has a per day cost ranging from $675 to $2,500.
Tennessee congressional representatives should be prepared to answer questions about HUD and these funding changes. We need to maintain the current funding levels and continue to invest in permanent housing programs that support Tennesseans who are poor, disabled and deserve safe places to live — like Kipp and Denny.

With polls open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m., anyone standing in line by 7 p.m. may still cast a ballot.
On Election Day you may bring one of the state’s acceptable IDs or, lacking one, be prepared to sign an ID Confirmation Statement and cast a provisional ballot. 
If you opt for a provisional ballot, you must submit proof of identity or that statement to your local electoral board by noon on the Friday following the election for your vote to count. Same-day registration is available: if you’re eligible but not yet registered, you may go to your precinct, register and cast a provisional ballot. 
 What’s at stake

This election cycle carries a “everything on the table” feel. 
At the top of the ticket, the Democratic nominee for governor, Abigail Spanberger, faces Republican nominee Winsome Earle‑Sears. 
Spanberger is a former congresswoman and ex-CIA officer who casts herself as a stabilising force amid political turbulence; she holds a double-digit polling lead, per a recent survey by Roanoke College. 
Sears, the current lieutenant governor and an ex-Marine, has portrayed herself as a defender of personal liberties who would continue outgoing Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s conservative policy agenda.
In the lieutenant governor contest, Democrats nominated state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond. If elected, she would become both the first Muslim and first South Asian American to hold statewide office in Virginia. Hashmi faces Republican radio show host John Reid, a figure whose campaign has been mired in internal GOP strife.
The attorney general’s race pits Republican incumbent Jason Miyares against Democrat Jay Jones. A text message scandal involving Jones has reshaped what some previously considered the Democrats’ easiest statewide pickup.
Meanwhile, control of the House of Delegates remains up for grabs. Democrats entered the election with a slim 51–49 majority, leaving little room for error in a year when both parties view Virginia as one of the nation’s most competitive legislative battlegrounds.
 Key House battlegrounds

Among the swing districts to watch is House District 22, anchored in northern Prince William County, where Republican incumbent Ian Lovejoy faces Democrat Elizabeth Guzmán. The two clash over data-center growth, reproductive rights and cost-of-living pressures.
In District 75 in suburban Chesterfield and Prince George counties and the city of Hopewell, longtime GOP Del. Carrie Coyner is locked in a rematch with Democrat Lindsey Dougherty, with education and health-care messages framing the contest.
In District 82, the rematch between Republican Del. Kim Taylor, R-Petersburg, and Democrat Kimberly Pope Adams could tip the balance in the House — Taylor narrowly won the prior election by only a few dozen votes, making this district a microcosm of the statewide battle. 
These contests are drawing national attention and resources. Democrats, for instance, poured more than $400,000 into key House races early in this cycle, signaling the nationalisation of what has historically been a purely state-level fight. 
 The drama behind the campaigns

Beyond the candidates and numbers, this election has been overshadowed by scandal and intra-party upheaval. On the GOP side, Reid’s campaign was shaken in spring when a Tumblr account — allegedly tied to the Republican — featuring explicit images of men surfaced, prompting Youngkin to ask Reid to step aside. 
But Reid refused, declared he “will not back down,” and the subsequent fallout exposed fractures within the Republican party. 
On the Democratic side, Jay Jones’ unexpectedly public and ugly text-message exchange from 2022, in which he fantasised about shooting a political rival in the head, ignited national media attention and raised questions about candidate vetting and campaign discipline. 
Republicans seized the moment, repeatedly pressing Spanberger to withdraw support for Jones — a pressure she resisted. 
The sole debate between Spanberger and Earle-Sears, held at Norfolk State University, saw struggle lines drawn over abortion, tax policy and the broader character question looming so large in this year’s cycle.
Layered atop those dramas are real-world policy issues that have entered the flesh of the election, not just the talk. For months, the federal government’s funding disruptions slowed SNAP and Medicaid payments in Virginia, putting financial strain on households and elevating economic security into a live political issue. 
Similarly, federal contract layoffs and idle civil-service jobs in the D.C.-metro region added urgency to the campaign messaging about job stability and state-federal alignment. 
Summer’s protests against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation actions in Virginia communities also heightened discussion around immigration policy, community trust and enforcement priorities. 
 The implications for governance

The outcome of Tuesday’s voting may pivot Virginia for the next two years or longer. 
Should Spanberger win the governorship and Democrats retain or expand their majority in the House, they would achieve a governing trifecta — potentially ushering in bold policy shifts on everything from tax reform to climate and public-education investment. 
It would also enable Democrats to press ahead with a slate of constitutional amendments to enshrine key rights — including the proposed amendment establishing a fundamental right to reproductive freedom in Virginia’s Constitution.
Similarly, the party is advancing resolutions to repeal the state-constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and affirm the right to marry regardless of sex or gender, and to restore voting rights automatically for people who have completed felony sentences. 
Conversely, if Republicans reverse their legislative losses and hold the governorship or pick up even one statewide office, they would extend the influence of the Youngkin-era framework and dampen an ascendant Democratic momentum.
In the House of Delegates, slight swings matter — flipping three to five seats in suburban districts could determine committee control, legislative agenda and whether bills pass or stall. It is why both parties have treated this cycle’s contests as far more than “off-year” elections.

RICHMOND, Va. — Some airports are experiencing an increase in flight delays and cancellations amid the government shutdown that furloughed workers or required them to work without pay.
Over 11,000 Federal Aviation Administration employees were furloughed, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation federal government shutdown plan. Over 13,200 air traffic controllers will work without pay.
Virginia is one of the states with the highest number of air traffic controllers, with approximately 1,110 employed, according to May 2023 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Overall, the federal government employs 147,358 Virginians, according to the Partnership for Public Service.
The Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, employs 64,000 workers which includes essential workers who must work without pay. TSA stated it has not yet experienced delays in operation due to callouts.
TSA and other federal workers saw their first zero paycheck on Oct. 24, according to Forbes.
“TSA will continue operations to keep the traveling public safe,” a TSA spokesperson stated. “While TSA is prepared to continue screening about 2.5 million passengers a day, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports. We kindly ask for our passengers’ patience during this time.”
The FAA slows traffic in some airports to mitigate issues with staffing shortages, according to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy.
Virginia airports, including Dulles and Richmond international airports and Roanoke-Blacksburg Regional Airport say there have not been significant impacts, such as abnormal delays due to the shutdown.
“To date, the essential federal workers at RIC including TSA, FAA, and USCBP, have remained on the job,” stated Troy Bell, spokesperson for Richmond International Airport. “The airport wishes for a speedy resolution so the shutdown can end.”
Flights to and from Richmond were delayed 52 times on Oct. 27, according to Flight Aware, a flight tracking platform. Roanoke-Blacksburg Regional Airport experienced 15 delays. There were 133 at Dulles International Airport.
Nationally, Southwest Airlines saw 34% of flights delayed, American Airlines 29%, Delta Air Lines 22% and United Airlines 19%, according to Reuters.
These three airports have not seen much fluctuation in overall delays in the past two years, according to the DOT.
 Mike Christine is the eastern regional vice president for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. There were already staffing shortages prior to the shutdown. The biggest concern during the shutdown is air traffic controllers not being paid, according to Christine.
Delays can also be attributed to other factors, such as weather conditions and changing airline schedules, which are unrelated to the shutdown, Christine said.
“I think right now in the government shutdown, there’s so much focus on air traffic control,” Christine said. “It’s just putting a spotlight on how fragile our system is.”
Current delays and cancellations are not out of the ordinary, but things could change if the shutdown continues, said Christine Hardenberger, owner of Modern Travel Professionals.
“There’s always delays, there’s always cancellations,” Hardenberger said. “That’s just part of air travel today, but we haven’t seen any sort of spike since the shutdown.”
TSA saw a 7% increase in unscheduled absences of TSA agents from the previous year during the late 2018 to early 2019 government shutdown, according to the Partnership for Public Service. This caused an increase in the time travelers spent in airport security lines.
The media focuses on air travel during the shutdown because it impacts many people. However, travelers should not be concerned, according to Hardenberger.
“I think travelers need to be aware that things could change at any time and so they need to plug into more direct sources of information,” Hardenberger said.
Federal workers continue to ensure traveler safety. They will eventually feel the strain of a slower, less efficient system since employees are working without pay, according to a spokesperson for Airlines for America, an industry association.
“We urge elected leaders to act with urgency and in good faith to identify a solution that will reopen government,” the Airlines for America spokesperson stated. “Travelers, the shipping public and the dedicated federal employees who protect and maintain our nation’s aviation system deserve continuity.”
The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act was passed in 2019, following the 34-day government shutdown that started in 2018. The legislation guarantees retroactive pay for federal employees impacted by a shutdown.

Washington Gas’ Net Zero Energy Homes Initiative.“
This was a head-scratcher. Gas as part of a net-zero energy home? Do we need to define our terms? 
Natural gas is a product that Washington Gas sells to customers in Northern Virginia, D.C., and Maryland. I’m pretty sure we’re talking about the same stuff: fossil fuel, mostly the potent greenhouse gas methane but also small amounts of propane, ethane and butane, extracted by fracking using hazardous chemicals and then transported by pipeline to be burned in homes and businesses. The process emits carbon monoxide and other unpleasant pollutants as well as the planet’s number one greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide.
So far, so good – or bad, depending on how you feel about fossil fuel pollution. 
Now, a net-zero energy home is one that produces more energy than it consumes, usually from electricity generated by solar panels. Heating and appliances are typically electric to take full advantage of the solar. A home that’s heated by gas, and maybe also has a gas stove and water heater, can’t run on electricity from solar. Making the home net-zero means installing a whole lot of solar that the home can’t use to “offset” the very polluting fuel that it does use, with all the extra electricity going out on the grid. 
But at least in Virginia, you won’t get approval from your electric utility to install a solar facility that produces significantly more electricity than the house consumes. Waving the Washington Gas ad in the face of your electric company will not change the result. 
The ad, in other words, is offering Virginians the impossible. 
That sums up the problem facing the gas industry in this era of rapid technological change and climate crisis. How does it remain relevant? 
Washington Gas chose to do what any business does when faced with a superior competitor: call in the marketing team. Sure, it’s not likely that any of their customers will actually try to make their home net-zero energy while using fossil fuel-burning appliances, and thereby face a rude awakening from their electric utility, not to mention the bless-your-hearts of their more knowledgeable friends. But it allows the company to pretend it’s part of the solution. (Since they’re stretching anyway, they can also pretend that corporations are our friends, and unicorns are real.) 
Washington Gas is not alone in attempting a charm offensive. Just this year, the gas industry formed a new advocacy group, the Natural Gas Coalition of Virginia. Its press release states that its aim is “to provide decision-makers with trusted resources and insights, highlighting natural gas’s contribution to grid stability, economic development, and daily life.” It doesn’t say anything about contributing to net-zero energy homes, but then, it also doesn’t mention its contribution to global warming.
Quite the contrary. The press release claims that burning gas has helped lower CO2 emissions in Virginia. Let’s be clear, though: our utilities haven’t lowered CO2 emissions by burning more gas, but by burning less coal. Fossil gas is still one of the top emitters of carbon in its own right. Our utilities could have lowered emissions much further by replacing coal with zero-carbon renewable energy. 
The focus on carbon emissions also conveniently leaves out methane’s direct role in global warming. As a greenhouse gas, methane is 80 times more potent than CO2 across a 20-year time period, and its leakage from fracking wells, pipelines, storage and other infrastructure makes “natural” gas at least as great a contributor to global warming as coal. 
But hey, every dirty industry needs a brand refresh now and then. It wasn’t long ago that the gas guys saw themselves as part of the fight against global warming. They called their product a “bridge fuel,” with the implication that they would go away quietly once carbon-free alternatives were ready to take over. 
Soon, though, the addition of horizontal drilling to fracking operations made fossil gas cheaper, more plentiful and more lucrative. Suddenly industry executives began to speculate that their product was no longer a bridge, but a destination. 
(The first time I heard that line tried out at a conference, I guffawed. ‘What’s the destination?’ I asked, ‘Cleveland?’ I have since come to regret that slur on Cleveland, which I understand has become a very nice city in the decades since I lived in Ohio. Fracking, on the other hand, is still the same dirty industry.) 
Maybe the most disconcerting thing about the Natural Gas Coalition of Virginia is that its members include not just gas companies, pipeline operators and the American Petroleum Institute, but also Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power. As public utilities, shouldn’t our electric companies at least pretend to be fuel-agnostic, if not full partners with Virginia in its quest to decarbonize?  
Dominion, however, has seized the moment to build a lucrative gas-fired peaker plant in Chesterfield, jiggering the numbers and pretending it had secured an independent review when it had not. It is even funding its own astroturf group, the Virginia Energy Reliability Alliance, in an effort to make it appear the project has loads of supporters in the face of strong, sustained opposition from loads of detractors.  
In their defense, sort of, Dominion and APCo show themselves highly sensitive to shifts in political winds, so their current enthusiasm for gas may be partly a sop to Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Our Republican governor talks about “all of the above” and “increasingly clean” energy but acts like a brand ambassador for methane. You would not know from his advocacy that fossil gas already makes up 70% of the state’s electricity supply and is responsible for a lot of the increase in our electric bills. At a time when even Trump’s Department of Energy says diversifying energy sources is critical to reliability and resilience, Virginia hardly needs more fossil gas.

Indeed, the wisdom of diversifying our generating sources was proved recently when APCo told the SCC it wants to lower residential rates by $10 per month due to lower fuel costs. APCo specifically cited its investments in renewable energy, which use no fuel.
Nevertheless, the Youngkin administration recently announced a partnership with gas pipeline operators and infrastructure companies “to increase natural gas power generation to meet unprecedented growth.” The press release cites a need for “more baseload power generation” (that is, gas) due to Virginia’s “economic momentum – driven by record job creation, population growth, advanced manufacturing, EV adoption, and more.” 
“And more”: that would be the data center industry, the one driver that’s actually responsible for the growth of electricity demand. The press release was crafted to avoid mentioning the industry that’s fast achieving pariah status in Virginia. While residents bemoan the impact of data centers on communities, drinking water supplies, and their utility bills, Youngkin celebrates “unprecedented growth.” 
And then there’s the kicker. To meet that growth, the press release says, the new partnership plans a study that “will identify locations between Roanoke and Bristol where new natural gas pipeline infrastructure can support new power generation facilities.”
I can only imagine how enthusiastic folks “between Roanoke and Bristol” will be to be singled out for yet another gas pipeline slashing through rural Virginia, this one solely in the service of Big Tech. 
No wonder Youngkin avoids connecting the dots for us. Maybe he should hire Washington Gas’ marketing team, and start pretending we can use the gas in net-zero homes.

Read additional coverage of the November 2025 election in Maine here.

	Without any key state offices up for reelection, this November’s ballot centers around two statewide referendum questions. Question 1 will ask voters if they want to make several changes to election law, including requiring identification to be shown at the polls. Question 2 will ask voters if they want to institute a red flag law to expand who can initiate the process of having firearms removed from someone who poses a danger to themselves or others.
Maine Morning Star has details on everything you need to know, such as same-day voter registration and where political leaders stand on the proposed election law changes. 
You can also check our Voter Guide for additional information before and after you cast your vote. Here are a few reminders to get the day started:
Find your polling place
The Maine.gov website offers a voter information lookup feature to find polling places and a sample ballot. 
Enter your home address to search for your unique information. Polls open between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. and close at 8 p.m. You can find specific hours for your location on the Upcoming Elections page on the Maine Department of the Secretary of State website.
Not too late to register to vote 
If you haven’t registered to vote, it’s not too late. You can register at your city hall, town office or polling place. All you need is an ID and proof of residency, such as a utility bill.
People who are unhoused may register to vote, even if they don’t have a traditional address. Instead of residency documentation, they can provide a physical description of their residence to their municipal clerk under oath.
What’s on the ballot?
Tuesday’s ballot will feature two statewide referendum questions, in addition to a plethora of local initiatives and offices. 
To find what is on your specific ballot — such as local referendum questions and municipal candidates — you can enter your address on the Vote 411 website. 
Question 1
The first statewide referendum question will read: “Do you want to change Maine election laws to eliminate two days of absentee voting, prohibit requests for absentee ballots by phone or family members, end ongoing absentee voter status for seniors and people with disabilities, ban prepaid postage on absentee ballot return envelopes, limit the number of drop boxes, require voters to show certain photo ID before voting, and make other changes to our elections?” 
The proposal seeks to modify a variety of election laws in the state, such as banning pre-paid return postage for absentee ballots and prohibiting voters from requesting absentee ballots by phone or through family members.
The proposal would also repeal the current provision in statute allowing immediate family members to drop off ballots for each other and roll back ongoing absentee voting, which allows voters to automatically receive absentee ballots. This option was implemented last February for voters over the age of 65 who self-identify as having a disability.
Additionally, the petition would remove the option for municipalities to get approval for multiple ballot drop boxes, instead only allowing one.
Question 2
The second question will ask voters if they would like to implement what’s known as a “red flag” law in the state, in addition to the existing yellow flag policy. Both are forms of extreme risk protection orders, which are used to temporarily confiscate firearms from someone who poses a risk of danger to themselves or others. 
On the ballot, it will read: “Do you want to allow courts to temporarily prohibit a person from having dangerous weapons if law enforcement, family, or household members show that the person poses a significant danger of causing physical injury to themselves or others?”
The referendum proposes allowing a family member, household member or law enforcement officer to file a petition, along with an affidavit of facts, for an extreme risk protection order if someone is suspected of posing a significant danger to themself or another person. That protection order would prohibit the person from purchasing, possessing or controlling a “dangerous weapon.” 
A court would be required to schedule a hearing within 14 days of when the petition is filed. If the court finds the individual does pose a significant risk of causing physical injury, the court must issue an order prohibiting them from purchasing, possessing or receiving a dangerous weapon for up to one year. The person would need to immediately surrender any dangerous weapons in their possession to law enforcement.
A person could request to have the order terminated if they can show evidence that they no longer pose a risk of physical harm. Conversely, an order can also be renewed for up to one additional year.
Petitions
There are two statewide citizen initiative petition campaigns that could be collecting signatures at the polls Tuesday.
One seeks to create legislation to establish universal health care coverage in the state. The petition specifically asks for the legislative committee in charge of health care and insurance matters to come up with a bill by 2028.
The other would require schools to separate teams, locker rooms and bathrooms by biological sex, mandating transgender students to play on teams and use facilities aligning with their sex assigned at birth. It would also introduce some coed teams.
Each petition will need about 68,000 signatures by early February to make it onto the 2026 ballot. The number of signatures required represents 10% of the total votes cast in the last gubernatorial election in 2022.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire’s system of public schools could look dramatically different in the next five years under a Republican proposal moving forward to reduce the number of school administrative units. 
The idea, presented last week in a report by a key study committee, would dramatically alter the structure of public schools in the state, after years of Republican concerns that districts are spending too much money on superintendents and other high-level officials.
Under the proposal, the state’s 107 school administrative units would be reduced to 12 — one for each of New Hampshire’s 10 counties and two more for Manchester and Nashua, the two largest cities. Those new SAUs would be run by elected administrators and would handle “business functions,” which would include human resources, transportation, food services, payroll, and more. Individual school districts and school boards would retain control over “academic functions,” which would include curriculum, hiring decisions, and discipline. 
The report calls on the consolidation plan to be implemented by the 2029-2030 school year. All five Republicans on the committee signed off on the report, with both Democrats opposed. House Republicans plan to bring forward a late bill ahead of next year’s session, said Rep. Dan McGuire, an Epsom Republican, in an interview. 
Republicans say the proposal is a necessary correction to decades of fragmentation of school administrative units, as towns have increasingly sought to break away from larger SAUs and create their own units. They note an analysis by Edunomics, a Georgetown University research group, that found New Hampshire schools saw a 58% increase in spending from 2013 to 2023, despite a decline in both enrollment and National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) reading and math test scores over that period. 
“I wish the Legislature was not in the position that it is where it has to step in and do something to address the out-of-control spending for locally made decisions,” said Sen. Keith Murphy, a Manchester Republican, who added that he wanted to change other laws to reduce the amount of administrative responsibilities placed on schools. 
But Democrats say the committee’s recommendation is too hasty, and that the idea of mandatory consolidation needs further study.
“More than one thing can be true at the same time. Being sympathetic to taxpayers and concerned — greatly concerned — about the cost of education does not cancel out the need to look at consolidation very, very deliberately, so that whatever plan is proposed, if any, does not diminish the quality of public education,” said Rep. Hope Damon, of Croydon. “And I do not think that this committee has thoroughly done due diligence to achieve that end.”
Currently, New Hampshire public schools have several layers of administration. Principals oversee individual high schools, middle schools, and elementary schools. School boards oversee school districts, which are made up of schools in one town or multiple towns. And superintendents oversee school administrative units, which merge one or more school districts into one overarching unit with combined administration.
The result is a three-tiered system in which different layers execute different functions. Republicans’ proposal would consolidate some of those functions into county-wide administrators, decreasing local control. But it would also send other functions down to the school district — and school board — level, potentially increasing it. 
“The majority thinks that over the years we have ceded control of education to superintendents who do not directly answer to the voters,” the committee’s majority states. “We believe we can achieve cost savings and at the same time return local control of academics to our elected school boards where it belongs.”
The committee’s plan is broadly inspired by Eric Pauer, an engineer and president of the School District Governance Association of New Hampshire, a conservative-leaning organization dedicated to imposing more parental oversight over school budgets and curriculum.
Pauer, the spouse of Rep. Diane Pauer, a Brookline Republican, pitched to the committee the idea of keeping curriculum and policy decisions at the local, school district level, while combining administrative tasks across the county. 
The idea also follows a 2025 bill, House Bill 765, which proposed consolidating SAUs. Sponsored by McGuire, the bill had a short life; the House Education Policy Committee recommended it be killed, 18-0, and the full House unanimously voted it down. At the time, Republican representatives objected to the idea of making superintendents elected, rather than appointed by school boards. 
To Pauer, the idea would split up responsibilities, allowing for specialization. Some responsibilities would benefit from an economy of scale, he said.
“The current SAU structures are very expensive and continue to grow in size and budget, and they’re largely unchecked,” he argued at an Oct. 2 committee meeting. “The costs are greatly outpacing inflation. Administrative overhead is not providing sufficient value to students.” 
But the system would still give parents a say over fraught issues such as curriculum and course content, he said. “(It’s a) win for school boards, principals, taxpayers, and, most importantly, the students,” he said.
Supporters of consolidation argue it could also help defray a major cost for districts: special education. By moving the administration of individualized education programs (IEPs) to the county level, the expense could be better spread out. “This specialization would particularly benefit smaller districts and spreads their financial risk over a larger population,” the report states. “It would, however, significantly change the size of county budgets.”
But representatives of school boards and superintendents are skeptical. Speaking before the committee, Barrett Christina, executive director of the New Hampshire School Boards Association, said most school board members appreciate having more localized superintendents, and that taking those away could erode local control.
Mark McLean, executive director of the New Hampshire School Administrators Association, acknowledged that administrative costs have increased, but said that is because of new responsibilities put on superintendents around student mental health, emotional well-being, and learning loss, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic. A county-wide administrator could struggle to meet those challenges, McLean argued. 
And Democrats said the committee did not have time to adequately price out the impact of consolidation, and did not do enough research into states that have implemented similar plans. They raise potential issues with school principals facing higher workloads, a reduction of direct superintendent-to-parent engagement, and a lack of specialization available for districts with unique needs. 
They challenged the assumption that consolidation could lead to savings, arguing that Maine and Vermont had experienced higher transportation costs when they attempted to consolidate.
And Democrats argued the proposal is a direct attack on local control, and one that could be unpopular. The recent splintering of school administrative units indicates that residents are more likely to prefer smaller SAUs to larger, county-wide ones, they said.
In the end, Democrats said they would support a bipartisan joint legislative commission to continue studying the issue, but urged closer vetting. “Rushing into any consolidation process without much more extensive evaluation and preparation would be irresponsible,” they wrote in a minority report.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0697-1024x570.jpg,,,2025-11-04 05:17:00.833675

(Photo by Stephanie Keith/Getty Images)In its quest to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, the Trump administration wants to let states police themselves when it comes to educating students with disabilities, a move many teachers and parents fear will strip away crucial federal oversight and deny vulnerable children the services they’re guaranteed under law.
In October, the Trump administration fired nearly all the employees in the U.S. Department of Education office that’s responsible for enforcing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the landmark federal civil rights law that guarantees students with disabilities the right to a free and quality public education. A federal judge blocked the layoffs a few days later, in response to a lawsuit filed by federal workers unions.
In addition to making sure states and school districts follow the law, the office distributes billions in federal funding to help states educate students with disabilities such as autism, deafness, developmental delays and dyslexia.
The court ruling halting the layoffs is likely just a temporary setback as Trump proceeds with his broader mission of closing the federal department. Trump and Education Secretary Linda McMahon have said their goals are to reduce bureaucracy and return more education responsibilities to the states.
Neither the Department of Education nor the White House, which are operating with fewer communications officers because of the government shutdown, responded to Stateline requests for comment.
Congress has never fully funded special education at 40% per-pupil costs promised to states under IDEA. Funding has fluctuated over the years; in 2024, it was about 10.9%. Federal IDEA funding is expected to continue, though without federal oversight from the Education Department.
Disability rights and education advocates worry that most states don’t have the resources — or, in some cases, the will — to adequately police and protect the rights of students with disabilities.
More states guarantee students the right to school-day religious instruction off campus

Some states in recent years have failed to provide adequate special education services, prompting investigation from the feds. Just 19 states meet the requirements for serving students with disabilities from ages 3 through 21, according to the most recent annual review from the Department of Education, released in June.
“Shifting all of that to the state and away from the feds is not something we’ve been able to wrap our heads around,” said Quinn Perry, the deputy director of the Idaho School Boards Association.
“Our state education department are excellent people, but that is a huge, drastic shift in workload they’d have to do on compliance,” she said, adding that Idaho is already facing a budget shortfall.
In Iowa, Democratic state Rep. Jennifer Konfrst, the former House minority leader, said she’s concerned that without federal oversight, the state would not hold schools accountable for providing special education services. She pointed to state lawmakers’ willingness to pass Iowa’s relatively new school choice program, which directs taxpayer funding to private school tuition but does not require private schools to provide services to students with disabilities.
“There are no provisions with private school vouchers that they have to provide special education,” she said. “Those kids are left at the public schools, which have been underfunded.”
Funding gaps
IDEA passed 50 years ago this month. Before then, education for children with disabilities depended entirely on where they lived.
They were often refused admission to public and private schools that lacked the resources or the will to properly educate them. Some had to forgo education entirely, while others were shut away in poorly equipped institutions that prioritized containment over learning.
In 2022-2023, about 7.5 million students — 15% of the kids in public schools — received special education services under IDEA, according to the most recent data available from the National Center for Education Statistics, the federal agency that collects education data.
The law requires public schools to provide a “free appropriate public education” in the least restrictive environment from birth through age 21 to children and youth with disabilities. That education includes services such as additional time to complete school work, assistive technology, or even a one-on-one aide.
Some supports, such as providing large-print materials or giving a student extra time to complete a task, are low-cost. But others can be expensive for schools to provide. For example, an American Sign Language interpreter might cost $50,000 a year, said Perry, of the Idaho school boards group.
And a recent Idaho state report noted that it costs upward of $100,000 per year to educate some special education students.
Educators there are already pushing for additional funding to help fill a gap — $82.2 million in 2023 — between available state and federal funding for special education and the amount that school districts actually spend.
The state report also found that, unlike the neighboring states of Oregon, Utah and Washington, Idaho doesn’t provide additional state funding for special education beyond the base per-pupil amount allocated by the state.
The federal government currently covers less than 12% of the costs of special education services nationwide, leaving state and local governments to foot the rest, according to the National Education Association, a labor union representing 3 million educators nationally. Without federal oversight, critics fear, nobody will hold states and school districts accountable for not spending enough.











We still have a federal mandate to provide services to these kids.


– Quinn Perry, deputy director of the Idaho School Boards Association



In some states, limited state funding means a disproportionate financial burden lands on individual school districts. On average, local districts are responsible for $8,160 per special education student per year, according to a report released last year by education nonprofit Bellwether that studied funding across 24 states.
The situation is so dire in Idaho that the state superintendent made special education funding her key issue for the state’s upcoming legislative session. She requested $50 million to help close the special education funding gap.
It’s an issue affecting school districts across the nation, said Perry.
“Just because [the feds] are shifting responsibility to states does not alleviate the fact that we still have a federal mandate to provide services to these kids,” Perry said. “IDEA is still the law of the land and your school district is still mandated to meet this law, but with perhaps a sprinkling in of chaos and, in a state like ours, still a gap in funding.”
At times, that funding gap has prompted some states to cut corners.
Rationed services
After a 15-month probe, the U.S. Department of Education found in 2018 that Texas had effectively rationed its special education services, capping the share of public school students who could receive those services at 8.5% of a district’s population, regardless of need and in direct violation of IDEA.
The feds also found that some Texas school districts intentionally identified fewer children as eligible for special education services if the number of those students exceeded the 8.5% threshold.
Though Republican Gov. Greg Abbott subsequently released a statement criticizing local school districts, educators and advocates blamed state legislators for recommending the caps as a way to control special education costs.
“Texas had about 5-7% of students who needed special education but were unilaterally denied it because the state decided that was too expensive,” said Lisa Lightner, a special education advocate and the mother of a student with a disability.
“Without this federal oversight, who’s to stop them from doing that again?”
Just last year, the Department of Education released Virginia from an ongoing investigation it had been under since 2019 for repeatedly failing to resolve complaints by parents of special education students.
The feds found the state had no procedures to ensure a timely resolution process for the complaints, leaving parents with little recourse when their students weren’t receiving needed services.
The federal monitoring ended in December 2024 after Virginia’s education department took corrective measures, including creating its own monitoring division, requiring additional educator training, and changing how the state handles complaints.
Trump’s DEI ban in K-12 schools, higher ed ruled ‘unlawful’ by federal judge

This year, states including Indiana, Iowa, Kansas and Mississippi were cited by the Education Department for not having systems in place that are “reasonably designed” to identify districts not complying with IDEA.
“No state gets it perfect all the time, but some states are better at it than others,” Lightner said.
Her home state of Pennsylvania has robust state oversight of special education, she said, but added that parents in some other states are panicking.
“There’s a societal mindset in some places that kids who need special education are never going to amount to anything, that they’re a drain on resources. Some people even think [allocating additional funds for their education] is giving them an advantage over other kids,” she said. “It’s an old-fashioned mindset that still exists in a lot of state leaders.”
States take notice
Some state lawmakers, troubled or encouraged by the Trump administration’s stance toward public education, have already filed their own legislation.
Republicans haven’t talked much about special education oversight, but even those at the state level have embraced the larger goal of shrinking the kind of regulation embodied by the Department of Education.
In Texas, state Rep. Andy Hopper, a Republican, filed a bill in February to abolish the state’s education agency.
“President Trump has called upon every level of government to eliminate inefficiencies and waste,” Hopper said in a statement announcing the bill, which later died in committee. “Texans pour billions into this state agency with the expectation that it will somehow improve education, but have been consistently and profoundly disappointed in the results.”
Alabama state Rep. Barbara Drummond, a Democrat, filed a bill in March to study how the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education would affect public education in Alabama.
Alabama parents are among those who sued the federal agency earlier this year over cuts to its Office for Civil Rights, claiming that investigations into alleged civil rights abuses in schools against students with disabilities and English learners have halted since Trump took office. Drummond’s bill also died in committee.
Since August, McMahon has been on a “Returning Education to the States” tour of all 50 states. She began it in Louisiana, the only state whose recent fourth-grade reading scores showed a significant increase compared with pre-pandemic levels, according to a large, congressionally mandated survey of educational progress across the states.
“There’s no one-size-fits-all in education,” she told reporters during her stop at a Baton Rouge school in August. “What works in one state may not work in another state.”
Federal law already gives states and local districts exclusive control over their own curriculum and education standards; the U.S. Department of Education can’t tell states what to teach, nor how to teach it.
Louisiana U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, a Democrat, expressed concern that the dismantling of the Department of Education would remove the kind of federal oversight that has, in the past, protected students’ civil rights when state and local governments didn’t. On his podcast in August, he pointed to the need for federal intervention during the Jim Crow era when Southern states tried to maintain segregation in schools.
“We were protected to be able to have an education because of the federal government,” said Carter, who is Black. “When you start taking those protections away, that’s damning for our country and it’s a huge step in the wrong direction.”
Lightner, who has 182,000 followers on her Facebook page, said parents who comment on her posts often debate the merits of the Trump administration’s shift on special education.
But Lightner said she hasn’t seen evidence of a cohesive plan to improve special education.
“If you blow up a house, even if I gave you a few hundred thousand dollars to build a new one, that doesn’t happen overnight,” she said. “This destruction, it’s going to be years until we’re back to normal. And even ‘normal’ missed a lot of kids.”

Domestic violence survivor Breaunna Nooks remembers how her abuser went with her to every doctor’s appointment. 
“When the nurse quietly asked me, ‘Do you feel safe at home?’ he was sitting right there beside me, watching to see what I would say,” Nooks said during a recent press conference. 
“That day, I realized something — silence was built into the system.”

She reached out to state Rep. Dontavius Jarrells, D-Columbus, with a question — what happens when a domestic violence survivor doesn’t feel safe in the hospital?
That question led Jarrells and state Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania, to introduce the Break the Silence Act. The bill is waiting to be assigned a number and a committee. 
“It builds a consistent statewide standard so every hospital and urgent care in Ohio knows how to respond when abuse walks through the door,” Jarrells said. 
“It turns compassion into action through training, documentation and clear procedures that ensure no survivor is left unseen or unheard.” 
Maria York, policy director at Ohio Domestic Violence Network, explained how the Break the Silence Act would be implemented when a domestic violence survivor shows up at a hospital or urgent care with injuries. 
“The care team takes private time with a patient, interviewing them separately from other family or household members, asking safety-focused questions, and clearly documenting injuries,” she said. 
“If violence is disclosed or suspected, the health care professional offers supportive materials and makes a warm referral to a local program that can help with safety planning and resources.”
York said this approach is consistent with guidance from national experts at Futures Without Violence. 
“Strong partnerships with local domestic violence programs let care teams make warm handoffs, coordinate safety planning and support survivors beyond discharge,” she said. 
Domestic violence survivors typically experience a myriad of responses from medical professionals depending on where they seek treatment, said Amber Howell, a clinical supervisor for Nationwide Children’s Hospital Center for Family Safety and Healing. 
“The Break the Silence Act recognizes that disparity and takes meaningful steps towards building a consistent statewide standard of response,” she said. 
“This legislation is grounded in the belief that safety should never depend on geography, training levels or institutional capacity.”
Ohio Women Against Domestic Network Founder Diana Williams remembers hiding her bruises and said the care she received as a domestic violence survivor depended on where she went. 
“At a neighborhood clinic, I was met with kindness and compassion, possibly because they felt sorry for me or maybe they could relate,” she said. 
“At a hospital, I was met with confusion, with disbelief and no guidance on what to do next. That kind of inconsistency can cost lives.” 
Domestic violence fatalities saw an increase this past year. 
There were 157 intimate partner relationship fatalities in 108 cases from July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025, according to a new report from the Ohio Domestic Violence Network. 
Of this year’s fatalities, 95 were victims and 62 were perpetrators. There were 82 male fatalities and 75 female fatalities. 
The report showed that 84% of all fatalities were a result of gun violence. It said 144 people were shot in 108 cases and only 12 people survived. And 56% of the primary victims killed were people of color. 
Intimate partner violence fatalities happened in 36 of Ohio’s 88 counties in 2025, according to the report. 
Franklin County had the most with 33, followed by Cuyahoga County with 20. 
Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein said his office averages between 5,000-6,000 domestic violence cases a year.
“The health care worker may be the victim’s first line of defense as a catalyst to change their lives for the better,” he said.

Echols and Fitz Johnson are the incumbents. Photos submitted by the candidatesThe results of an unusual off-year special election for two seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission are being closely watched as a key indicator of voter sentiment heading into the critical 2026 midterm election.
Whereas Republicans say they are running on a track record of producing reliable energy, Democratic leaders have framed the PSC election as a referendum on rising energy bills and Republican leadership, calling it the most direct way for consumers to express their policy preferences around utility affordability.
The commission regulates utilities like electricity and natural gas, giving the little-known panel a say over how much Georgians pay for those services and the energy sources used to power Georgia’s grid. The five commissioners serving today are all Republican. 
“If we win on Tuesday, it is going to be the voters telling Republicans, ‘we’re sick of it,’” said Democratic Party of Georgia Chairman Charlie Bailey in an interview Monday.

This year’s election, delayed since 2020 by litigation challenging the commission’s at-large voting system, features two Republican incumbents defending their seats against Democratic challengers who have centered their campaigns on energy affordability and a series of six Georgia Power rate increases in two years. 
A Democratic victory in either or both races would be the first time the party has won a statewide constitutional office since 2006. Even two wins Tuesday would not change the partisan control of the commission, but it would provide significant momentum for the 2026 elections, which include an open race for governor and the reelection bid of U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff.
Georgia’s election is also attracting national attention. Democratic National Committee vice-chair Jane Kleeb dropped into Georgia this week to lend a hand. 
“These Public Service Commission races are so critical, not only for what they’re in charge of with utility and affordability and energy mix, but for next year, when Ossoff is on the ballot, you need that momentum,” Kleeb said.
Republican incumbents lean on ‘reliable’ voters
Republicans, including Gov. Brian Kemp, have campaigned to rally their base, partly by trying to tie Democratic candidates in Georgia to national Democrats and energy policies that tend to galvanize right-leaning voters. 
Fitz Johnson, the Republican incumbent in District 3 who was appointed by Kemp in 2021, has defended Georgia’s mix of nuclear, natural gas, coal and renewables as balanced and the best way to keep energy reliable and rates affordable. He has attributed price spikes to nationwide inflation and the costs associated with the Plant Vogtle nuclear expansion project, which was billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule. 
Both Johnson and Tim Echols, the Republican incumbent from District 2, also backed a proposal this year to freeze Georgia Power base rates until 2028, although the arrangement will not shield ratepayers from bill increases to pay for hurricane cleanup and other costs. Echols said the freeze was a necessary measure for customers to recover from “the vast inflation we have experienced since the pandemic.”
Georgia Republicans say they fear local elections could help Democrats in statewide utilities race

While emphasizing grid reliability and economic development, Republicans have also resorted to identity politics and charged terms, with Echols labeling his opponent, Alicia Johnson, as a “DEI specialist,” based on language she had in her biography. She has rebuffed the attack as a “racist, MAGA dog-whistle,” saying that “it’s a reflection of him, not me.” 
The Georgia Republican Party has also tried to link the two Democratic candidates to New York candidate for mayor Zohran Mamdani and national Democrats like U.S. Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. That move, Georgia Republican Party Chairman Josh McKoon said, is designed to bring out reliable Republican voters who “tend to show up every time there’s an election, (but) that have not shown up this time.”
“That has to do with the fact that there are a lot of voters remaining out there to turn out who will respond to a message highlighting the partisan differences,” McKoon said.
Democratic candidates bank on affordability
Democrats are banking on widespread voter frustration over recent rate hikes. Georgia Power residential customers are paying about $43 more per month since 2023 to cover rate increases, fuel expenses and costs from the Plant Vogtle nuclear expansion, translating to an additional $500 the average customer pays in energy cost per year.
Alicia Johnson, the Democrat running for District 2, is advocating for increased scrutiny of utility spending, more clean energy adoption and greater consumer protections. She has centered her campaign on affordability and reliability, saying that 47% of Georgia’s households face financial “volatility and precariousness.”
The winner in District 2 will serve for five years until 2030.
Peter Hubbard, the Democrat in District 3, is a clean energy advocate who has intervened in PSC proceedings since 2019, where he has served as an expert witness. He has criticized the incumbents’ approval of the series of rate hikes and said he can lower Georgians’ power bills by shifting away from fossil fuels, adopting more renewable energy, along with limiting Georgia Power’s guaranteed profit margin. 
If Hubbard wins, he will only serve one year before having to defend his seat in 2026, when he’ll be up for reelection with Tricia Pridemore, a commissioner since 2018. If the two serve together, they have signaled that they are likely to be at odds with each other. Pridemore posted on social media on Halloween a text she received from Hubbard that called her “Bribemore,” saying that Hubbard called her a “nasty name.”
Hubbard has repeatedly said that he thinks he’d be able to work well with “at least two” of the Republican commissioners not up for reelection if elected and said Saturday while campaigning in Lawrenceville that Pridemore is “not a pleasant person” and often unwilling to listen to expert witnesses. When asked, he did not deny sending the text but said it was “a bad case of an autocorrect mistake.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/psc3-1024x550.png,,,2025-11-04 05:17:00.833675
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-04 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"In CT, it’s getting harder to find candidates to run for local office",Josie Reich,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/04/recruiting-local-candidates-online-politics-civics-education/,Hostile online politics and waning civic engagement — plus the substantial time commitment — have discouraged people from seeking office.,"The Vernon Democratic Town Committee was scrambling to find a candidate to challenge the town’s well liked, six-term Republican mayor, Daniel Champagne. It was June, just five months until this year’s municipal election, and no one had stepped forward. 
“It was like pulling teeth to fill out the slate,” said state Rep. Kevin Brown, D-Vernon. “We were going through a Rolodex of if there’s anybody who knows anybody who would run for mayor.”
With the clock ticking down to November, the committee leaders approached Jeremy Geller, a retiree who serves on the town’s Conservation Commission. Geller, 67, had never dreamed of entering politics. He was enjoying his retirement, biking Connecticut’s rail trails and tending to his garden while keeping an eye on local issues. 
When he was first asked, he was reluctant. Geller enjoyed being an anonymous person. And rising political violence in the news worried him, especially the assassination of Minnesota Democratic state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband.
“There’s such vituperation and tendency even to political violence,” Geller said. “I wondered, well, what do I lose by running? I mean, do I lose my safety?”
For party leaders in towns and cities around Connecticut — and across the country — finding candidates to run for local offices is getting harder. 
There are 39 uncontested races for mayor or first selectman in Tuesday’s municipal elections in Connecticut. Twenty-four Republicans and 15 Democrats are running unopposed. 
Nationally, 70% of elections were uncontested in 2024, according to a Ballotpedia analysis that included all levels of government except the presidency. Connecticut was on par with that average, with 71% of all races unopposed.
Connecticut political organizers, state officials and researchers say a more hostile national political climate and declining civic engagement — on top of the substantial time commitment required of local officials — have discouraged many potential candidates from seeking office.
Connecticut Secretary of the State Stephanie Thomas has sought to address the issue through an educational campaign. Last week, her office launched an online platform to teach residents about how to engage with local politics and policy. The site includes resources about how to run for office.
Joseph Thornton, a spokesman for the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, said he visited ten towns over the past six weeks and every one of them mentioned a problem with candidate recruitment. He said one town official told him she’d like to leave her post but there was no one available to fill it, and she didn’t want to put the town in that position.
“You factor in … all the pressures of the job, late nights 24/7, and you throw in that people are just going to yell and scream at you no matter what you do, it’s not very attractive,” Thornton said.
A big commitment
Holding a public office is no easy job, particularly as political engagement on the local level has waned in recent years while online rhetoric has grown more hostile.
On Connecticut town Facebook pages, commenters call local leaders corrupt, take aim at them with expletives and assign uncharitable nicknames.
“Many municipal officials feel like they’re under attack in the community,” said Elizabeth Gara, executive director of the Connecticut Council of Small Towns. “And it’s not just an issue in local politics, it’s an issue across the nation.”
More than half of local elected officials have experienced threats or harassment, according to a study of over 4,000 of these officials conducted by Princeton University’s Bridging Divides Initiative (BDI) and CivicPulse.
Other BDI research found that local politicians have been particularly on edge in the wake of highly publicized incidents of political violence — among them the assassinations of Hortman and activist Charlie Kirk and the arson of the home of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.
In the first half of 2025, there was a 9% increase in harassment of local officials compared with the same period last year, according to the study, which identified nearly 300 incidents of harassment in the first half of this year.
Nancy DiNardo, former chair of the Connecticut Democratic party from 2005 to 2015, said that during her tenure, residents were generally civil toward people running for office because they often knew them personally or through local communities. 
That may be less of an inhibitor now. 
“We’re seeing it here in Connecticut: a lot of trolling on social media, a lot of hostile, nasty comments on social media, a lot of stalking when you’re out campaigning,” said Patricia Russo, executive director of The Campaign School at Yale University, a nonpartisan organization that trains women to run for office. For some people who might consider running for office, “that is definitely a deterrent,” Russo said.
Benjamin Proto, chair of the Connecticut Republican party, said he first observed online vitriol toward candidates as Facebook was becoming more popular, and he has seen it grow alongside the expansion of social media.
“People will go after spouses, they’ll go after children,” Proto said. “And people look at that [and think], ‘I don’t want to put my family through that. It’s not worth the time, it’s not worth the effort, it’s not worth the BS that I have to put up with to sit on the Planning and Zoning Commission.’”
State Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, has experienced repeated online threats of violence. State Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, and Attorney General William Tong have both been threatened with bombs at their homes.
Windsor Mayor Nuchette Black-Burke said it has been difficult to find people willing to fill Board of Education and constable positions in her town. 
She said she believes political conflicts should not become personal. “Folks that don’t understand that we can disagree on a point, but we can still go down to the local eatery and have a cup of coffee,” Black-Burke said.

Holding office can also be time-consuming, another aspect that keeps people from running.
“Serving as first selectman or mayor is a 24/7 position at this point,” Gara said.
State and federal regulations heap responsibilities on municipal officials, she said. For example, stormwater management requires record keeping and inspections — and compliance takes time and resources, Gara said.
People are busy, she added. In many families, both parents work full time and children are enrolled in several extracurriculars.
Because Connecticut operates without county governments, each town has to manage all of its own resources, from police to schools to the fire department. As communities grow and governments take on more responsibilities, managing it all becomes a bigger job, and elected officials don’t usually have large staffs, Proto said.
[RELATED: CT towns, desperate to fill technical jobs, scramble for workers]
“You began to see government become more complicated, government becoming more expensive, government providing more services at all levels that had to be managed,” he said.
CCM’s Thornton said more state financial support could help overburdened local leaders comply with changing state regulations, and thereby make the positions more attractive. 
Holding public office can sometimes feel like thankless work, especially as engagement in local civic matters seems to be declining. 
Windsor’s Black-Burke said she believes public service used to carry respect in a way it no longer does. But she tells potential candidates that elected office is about something more. “It’s really about building a legacy, building change, trying to be a difference in your community,” she said.
Whom parties recruit for office can also affect civic engagement, said Maresa Strano, deputy director of the political reform program at left-leaning think tank New America. State party chairs tend to recruit fewer women and minorities because they’re seen as less electable, she said. That bias contributes to the shortage of candidates because “there are just fewer of those older, pillar-of-the-community white guys who have a dynasty in that town,” she said. 
“A lot of those people are retiring or dying, and who’s going to take over?” Strano said.
Education is a start
State politicians say that investing in civics education is important to get more people to take part in elections.
“What I’ve learned is that people care deeply about their communities and they want to become more involved, but they don’t know where or how to get started,” Secretary of State Thomas said at an Oct. 27 press conference about the new online educational platform her office launched, Power of Civics.
State Rep. Brown, of Vernon, said a lot of people simply don’t know these local leadership positions exist. Local governance is not always taught, and community members may never interact with their officials or learn what they do, he said.
DiNardo, the former state Democratic party chair, said personal outreach encouraging people to run is crucial. Sometimes it’s as simple as explaining that the effort of campaigning can be more time-consuming than holding the office itself, she said. It all comes down to effort, she added, and town committees often don’t expend energy on elections that seem out of reach.
Proto, the Republican party chair, said sometimes unopposed elections simply mean that residents generally approve of the incumbent, and any challenger may not have much of a chance.
Strano said she sees all the uncontested races in Connecticut as a good way for third parties and young people to get a foothold in politics.
“I think that these third parties would see those uncontested races or vacancies as opportunities to run their own candidates,” Strano said. “Seems like a really missed opportunity on their part.”
She added that these races are a good way for young people to get involved and provide an opportunity to change the makeup and priorities of local government.

Geller, the Vernon retiree, entered his town’s race for mayor in July. He’s a long-shot challenger, but he has focused his campaign on issues he’s passionate about, like health care and housing. And on the trail, Geller said he’s found a positive reception to door-knocking and hasn’t experienced any of the attacks he feared.
Uncontested elections, even for the farthest down-ballot races in the smallest towns, put “power in the hands of the few,” said Rep. Brown.

Macy shows how that machine filled a vacuum left by the demise of local journalism. 
It also followed decades of disinvestment in education. And trade policies enthusiastically backed by Democrats and Republicans that devastated small businesses and working people. And an opioid epidemic that is now an intergenerational affliction. 
There’s also the fact that a lot of more-comfortable people have been scornful without any real understanding of how dire things have become.
A native of Urbana, Ohio, Macy is an accomplished journalist and author. 
In her critically acclaimed book “Dopesick,” she chronicled the way Purdue Pharma addicted vulnerable Americans, devastated millions of families and made off with the profits.

Beth Macy’s new book is about her hometown of Urbana, Ohio, and how much the middle class has been hollowed out. (Courtesy photo by Meredith Roller.)
Macy herself was hardly a product of Urbana’s country club set.
“…I was among the poorest kids in my class, and I felt it,” she writes. “Not just as I delivered newspapers from the back of my ten speed, befriending up and down the class ladder, but also on my block of South Walnut Street, where slurry voices inside our house sometimes pierced the joyful noise of our kickball games and hide-and-seek.”
Macy grew up with her share of trauma in the humble part of town. And she’s spent a career examining what’s happened to the powerless. 
Even so, she wasn’t prepared for what she found in today’s Urbana.
Starting the project, Macy, now of Roanoke, Va., made extended visits to Ohio and did multiple interviews with family members and high-school friends, including the Urbana police chief. 
She saw alienation, misinformation, and desperation that blew her away.
“I think it says we’re living in total bubbles,” Macy said in an October interview. 
“I live in a blue dot in southwest Virginia in a city of roughly a quarter-million people, and my friends think exactly what I think, for the most part. I get along with my neighbors who are of various political stripes, but you know who you can talk to about politics and who you can’t.”
Stepping outside those bubbles can be disquieting.
Macy described being driven around town by a high school friend who was a firefighter. 
He pointed out places where he revived people who were overdosing, a sadly common experience.
“Then he started talking about who was QAnon,” Macy said, referring to a far-right conspiracy theory. 
It claims that President Donald Trump is fighting a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles. Some people believe in it despite an utter lack of evidence — and despite Trump’s obvious reluctance to release investigative files about real-life pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
“It was people I’d known,” Macy said of the QAnon adherents her friend identified. 
“Store owners and nurses and a dear friend who’d organized the class reunion. And then to just hear it out of their mouths and just hatred for the press. I’d say, ‘I’m the press.’ And they’d be like, ‘Oh, you’re OK.’ There were all these far-fetched theories they were comfortable saying to someone they hadn’t spoken to in 40 years. My jaw dropped on an almost hourly basis.”
In her book, she described her friend Karla, a lawyer. She went to dinner one night with four friends, two of whom were her cousins. She told them she’d gotten the COVID vaccine that day. 
“‘We were hanging out, our drinks had come, but we hadn’t ordered yet, and they all got up and left,'” Macy quotes Karla as saying. “‘I said, ‘You guys are joking, right? And they were like, ‘No, we don’t want to get COVID, and you’re actively sloughing off virus at our table.'”
Those stories might help explain why a majority keeps voting for U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, a Republican who lives in Urbana. 
Known for his fiery appearances in committee hearings and on right-wing media, Jordan hasn’t passed a single piece of legislation in his 18 years in Congress.
Unreported hardship
There isn’t just one reason for the wildfire spread of suicidal poppycock. But a big one Macy identified was the decline of her local newspaper. It’s especially painful to her because she worked there both as a delivery girl and then as a reporter. 
During her research trips to Urbana, Macy met and followed young people who, like her, came from the poor side of town. 
They include Silas James, a trans man who grew up having to act as the functional adult in an extremely dysfunctional family. 
An excellent student, Silas faced a titanic struggle figuring out how to go to Clark State College to study welding. 
He didn’t have access to the financial aid Macy and her cohort did, but he’d gotten scholarships. But then Silas also had to find a way to reliably make the 30-minute drive. There were times when it might as well have been 3 days.
Macy said he was far from alone. 
In a community in which nearly a third of kids are chronically absent from school, they also face fallout from the Great Recession, the family-dissolving opioid crisis, and lives lived on social media that can be astonishingly vapid and cruel. 
Even the exceptional kids like Silas find it almost impossible to make a better life, no matter how hard they try. 
Macy said she learned it’s far harder now to climb out than when she did it in the 1980s.

“There’s so many ways to count it,” she said. “I was desperate not to be just anecdotal, so I interviewed the police chief and the fire chief — who runs (emergency medical services) — multiple times just to get hard data. I asked how many mental health calls (a year) did you get when you started in the mid-80s? Forty. How many do you get now? Three hundred seventy. 
“I’m not making that up. I’d tell my friends who are in the professional class in Urbana, and they’d say, ‘Well, isn’t it like that everywhere?’ And I’d say, ‘This is your local community and you had no idea.'”
In her book, Macy writes that while the local paper “used to cover everything from DUIs to city council meetings to fire station fundraisers, readers were now left to rely on press releases and Facebook posts, creating a gaping void in my community’s understanding of itself. People now knew every detail of what their national political candidates were saying and doing, but almost nothing about the lives of their neighbors.” 
Without a healthy local newspaper, better-off Urbana residents had no clue how the other half was living. 
In a group interview, even retired teachers were shocked to learn about plunging rates of attendance and language proficiency among students in their own community.
“With the hollowing out of the middle class you have the country club set and what someone called the ghetto set and neither knows what the other is doing and there’s no real press to report on that,” Macy said.
Hurt dogs bite
None of the problems facing the small-town and rural poor are helped by what Macy sees as a lack of empathy that’s too common on the left. 
She said many urban and suburban professionals don’t see the harm that the 1992 North American Free Trade Agreement did to communities such as Urbana.
At another author’s book-signing, Macy got into a discussion with a prominent photographer, who asserted that Democrats hadn’t done a thing to piss anybody off on the other side.
Telling the woman about her trips back home, “I suggested that maybe she was too insulated to understand the utter rage provoked by globalization, Christian nationalism and rural despair — and how truly nihilistic the American experiment seemed to be turning,” Macy writes in her book. 
“We argued for a bit and then she pushed back hard, as if she didn’t believe me. Finally I threw up my arms and sputtered out the rawest description I could manage on the spot: Hurt dogs bite.”
Macy described how, with the rise of online tribalism and the demise of a journalistic town square, people have been radicalized — to their own detriment. 
A former boyfriend had worked as a journalist, and back then he was one of the most liberal people she knew. But he felt increasingly alienated over not agreeing to every bit of the orthodoxy.
“He described moving away from the Democrats, as he describes it, for  being vilified by his friends,” Macy said. “The Democrats haven’t done everything right by any means. Look at globalization… Clinton said it was a win-win, and places like Urbana will never see it as a win-win.

“It’s not like (her ex) is wrong about everything. But once his community shuts him off, then he finds community on the internet. So when I ask him where he’s getting these whackadoodle beliefs — I don’t ask him like that — he says he’s spending four to seven hours a day reading (what is actually) Russian propaganda.”
Believing Obamacare was a scam, he declined to carry health insurance and was dead at 63.
Hope
Macy’s mother was dying in 2020 — in the midst of one of the most traumatic presidential elections in U.S. history. 
As it happened, Macy was shocked by the information chasm dividing her own family.
A Newsmax-watching sister denied clear election results “as our mother was literally breathing her last breaths. I thought, holy crap, what’s happened to my family, my community and my country?” 
That sister had also spent years denying that her husband — a Christian conservative her preacher whom told her to marry — had molested her daughter from an earlier marriage, Macy writes. Her denial amplified the trauma.
Such trauma is disturbingly common, and has an impact on political discourse.
Macy quoted Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Barbara Kingsolver, who has written extensively about life among the poor in Appalachia. 
“When people are living with a lot of trauma and poverty, it changes their thinking process; they see things more in black and white, all or nothing,” she quoted Kingsolver as saying. 
“My plea is for respect — to think about talking with people who disagree with you and carrying some respect to the conversation because nothing else will work.” 
Macy said that fits well with what the experts she spoke to said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We have to connect the disparate threads in our life,” she said. “We have to build the community. So doing things, meeting new people, connecting them with other people, it’s actually fun. It’s an antidote to despair.”
That includes talking earnestly with people with whom you might not be in perfect agreement. 
Macy described how her Fox News-watching brother traveled from Urbana to Roanoke to see her nonbinary child’s band play.
“Tim didn’t know anyone who was nonbinary, but he loved the music and he loved my kid,” she said. “He asked me questions that weren’t mean-spirited. He taught me that you can ask a hard question. You can extend each other grace.”
As high as she found Urbana’s social siloes to be, Macy said she wants to keep them from fossilizing there and elsewhere. That means taking action.
She’s been doing things like passing out narcan kits and joining the board of a diaper bank. 
“Audrey Lorde said that despair is the tool of our enemies,” Macy said. “I know there are days when you just want to hide, but we’ve got to get out there. As I say in the book, we have to scramble for hope fiercely the way a farm girl wrestles a muddy sow. We have to flex those hope muscles and figure out what we can do and how we can get our voices heard.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-03-at-11.20.12 AM.png,,,2025-11-04 04:57:03.423681

Utilities tend not to be big fans of rooftop solar, which eats into their revenues by reducing customer reliance on the power grid. A new Ohio lawsuit spotlights the tension between utilities and customers over the clean-energy technology.


The case deals with a monthly charge imposed by the city of Bowling Green’s municipal utility on its few customers with solar panels on their rooftops. Customers who use batteries to store surplus solar power pay even more.


Residents Leatra Harper and Steven Jansto claim the charge, which for them amounts to roughly $56 per month, is an unlawful ​“tax or penalty.” When combined with the city’s partial payment for power fed back into the grid, it almost doubles the payback period for their $37,000 solar system, the couple said.


The city argues the fee is needed to make sure other customers don’t subsidize those with rooftop solar. As households that produce some of their own electricity buy less from the utility, they pay less for fixed costs built into its retail rates, such as staffing, grid equipment, and maintenance. The utility would then look to other customers to make up the difference.


The situation echoes ​“cost-shift” arguments that have dogged rooftop solar around the nation. It could also be a preview of a statewide battle to come as the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio gears up to review and revise its net-metering rules, which determine how solar owners are compensated for the energy they send to the grid. Municipal utilities like Bowling Green are not subject to these rules, but the dynamics around the fairness of rooftop solar rates are similar in either case.


For their part, Harper and Jansto installed rooftop solar panels and battery storage at their home in 2019 and 2020 with hopes of lowering their electric bills and cutting their carbon footprint. The investment will eventually pay for itself because they now buy less electricity from the utility while getting some credit for excess fed back to the grid.


“We could get to near net-zero with a cost up front, but with a payback,” said Harper, who is managing director of the FreshWater Accountability Project, an environmental group.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

Residential solar doesn’t just help those who invest in it.


“Rooftop solar helps to provide electricity locally. It reduces overall demand,” said Mryia Williams, Ohio program director for the nonprofit group Solar United Neighbors. That means less wasted energy because the power doesn’t need to travel as far as imported electrons, and it lowers stress on the transmission system as climate change exacerbates extreme weather and energy demand grows.


Energy fed into the grid from homeowners’ renewable energy systems can save other customers money, too.


“The highest demand periods on the grid tend to coincide with times when residential solar power is producing at its peak,” said Tony Dutzik, an associate director and senior policy analyst for the Frontier Group, a sustainability-focused think tank. ​“Those tend to be the times that utilities spend the most money to provide power for their customers.”


The health and environmental benefits of rooftop solar are ​“pretty obvious,” especially when excess energy offsets purchases from inefficient gas-fueled peaker plants, Dutzik continued. Less consumption of fossil fuels lowers greenhouse gas emissions and other pollution that is linked to multiple illnesses and more than 8 million deaths per year worldwide — problems that could worsen in the U.S. as the Trump administration rolls back climate policy.

 What’s fair?

Policymakers have ​“oftentimes undervalued the benefits that rooftop solar can bring, and when you fail to really account for the benefits, you tend to wind up in the situation where people think it’s not fair,” Dutzik said.


Along those lines, Brian O’Connell, utilities director for Bowling Green, said via email that the city adopted its $4-per-kilowatt monthly charge for installed renewable capacity ​“to ensure rooftop solar customers were paying for the electric service they were receiving, and that the rooftop solar customers were not being subsidized by non-solar customers.”


The rationale resembles an argument promoted by ALEC, the American Legislative Exchange Council, since 2014. The Center for Media and Democracy has long criticized the group for coddling the fossil-fuel industry while working to suppress the vote and stifle dissent.


Consumer advocates and some academics have made similar cases in California, whose solar capacity leads the nation for both rooftop and overall.


But Harper and Jansto were surprised when they learned Bowling Green adopted its ​“Rider E” charge roughly six months after work on their home’s renewable energy system wrapped up.


The utility had seemed friendly toward solar: Its website touts the significant share of its power that comes from renewables. Yet while the city aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it does have a long-term ​“take-or-pay” contract to get about half of its electricity from the Prairie State coal plant in Illinois.


Legal and constitutional claims in the couple’s Sept. 19 complaint include unlawful and irrational discrimination. The City of Bowling Green filed its answer on Oct. 14, denying liability and asserting governmental immunity and other defenses.


O’Connell said the $4/​kW rate for the charge resulted from a cost-of-service analysis by the municipal utility’s consultant, Sawvel & Associates. The city charges a general retail rate of about 13 cents per kilowatt-hour for any electricity it sells to customers. However, it credits rooftop solar owners just 7.5 cents per kilowatt-hour for whatever they supply to the grid.


O’Connell responded to Canary Media’s request for information about how the Rider E rate was calculated by sharing two spreadsheets. Each lists total savings or costs for the utility from a rooftop solar customer’s energy production, including what the utility saves by not paying other sources for capacity, transmission, and wholesale energy when customers feed excess power onto the grid.


But the documents don’t detail how the utility spends the solar surcharge. It’s unclear whether the rooftop solar fees are helping pay for the Prairie State coal plant: O’Connell’s response to Canary Media’s question merely noted the city still has to purchase energy from the electric market.


Harper and Jansto’s case will move through legal motions and pretrial fact-finding, called discovery, during the coming months. Meanwhile, advocates worry about the broader questions the case raises.


“We can look at it both ways with who’s supporting whom whenever rooftop solar is installed,” said Williams of Solar United Neighbors. In her view, ​“it’s hard to believe that it’s some sort of subsidized rate,” especially if solar customers get only partial credit for letting others use their excess energy.


Ultimately, Dutzik said, rate systems still should not discourage people from investing in renewable energy for their homes. Indeed, if high fees delay recovery of investments for too long, ​“fewer people are going to get solar,” Dutzik said. ​“And that is going to drive up costs for other consumers.”

(Photo by Ben Palen for Kansas Reflector)Perhaps this native Kansan is biased, but our state’s sunsets in October are something special.
Amidst the green of newly planted wheat fields, the palette of colors from the trees getting ready for their winter naps, and the reds and bronzes of milo fields on the cusp of harvest, those sunsets set the tone. There is something about a sunset, especially so at that time of year when the seasons change, that gives cause for reflection. I have had the opportunities to see the sunsets of autumn all the way from the skyscrapers in New York to the deserts of Saudi Arabia, and while they were sometimes glorious, nothing matches those in Kansas.
For me, October is the month for breathtaking Kansas sunsets. That may be even more so in my case because it is the month of my birth, and the month of my mother’s passing. The memories come flooding back, and emotional moments are recalled.
I will always remember a comment that my mother made to me during one of our regular Sunday afternoon phone calls when I had gone on to Chicago to begin law school. She said that, while the sunset marked the end of another day when I would not be home, it gave her hope that I would return in the following days — at least to visit. That I did, along with helping during wheat harvest for years thereafter. Somewhere tucked away in a dust-covered box of old photographs, many of which are now weathered, is one she took years ago of the sunset near dusk on an October day.
I kept that at my desk for years after I moved to Chicago and then to New York.
One constant about the Kansas sunsets is that they seem to stretch to the horizon, and then some. Some may see only a barren landscape in the vastness of, say, western Kansas, but there is a quiet beauty, and the sunsets magnify that beauty. You just have to stop, listen, look around, and reflect. The reflections that come to mind from those Kansas sunsets run the gamut from heartache to triumph, and every emotion in between those two. They will stay with me for all of the days of my life.
For many of us, we have lost track of little moments that are so important in life. We are caught up in the noise of social media, the insanity and chaos of the current political environment, along with the decline in civility that seems to mark so much of today’s world. We get blinded by all of it.
We forget to pay attention to what really matters.
What does matter is that we have a limited number of days on this earth. How we live matters. We need to listen to those little voices within us that might only be heard when we find quiet moments to take the time to reflect.
A perfect point of reference for me is those Kansas sunsets. They are the calming influence, that moment in time when it is just me, my thoughts, and the vastness of the beauty that they offer. They help to provide perspective, and they remind us that the richness of life is enhanced by quiet moments, contemplating the universe with the backdrop of the Kansas sunsets on a late October afternoon.

(Photo by Susan Tebben/Ohio Capital Journal)Betrayal can be dressed up as bipartisan or best-case scenario, but it is still betrayal. 
Ohio Republicans picked off two more congressional districts to gerrymander, in defiance of the Ohio Constitution and the clear will of Ohio voters. 
They framed their con as a “compromise” with Ohio Democrats who defended their complicity in disenfranchising thousands of Toledo and Cincinnati voters as the best possible outcome.
This is not what democracy looks like. This is what partisan preservation over democratic representation looks like.   
No wonder people have clocked out of politics. Can’t blame them for thinking their vote isn’t worth a fig if self-dealing politicians don’t respect it or the law.
Ohioans voted twice to end the egregious practice of contorting electoral district boundaries for political gain— like the gerrymandered sham just approved at the expense of voters in two of Ohio’s largest cities.
Over 70% of voters approved constitutional amendments in 2015 and 2018 precisely to prevent what the Ohio Redistricting Commission did last week. 
Ohioans demanded a level playing field in the redistricting done every decade based on the results of the decennial census. 
They voted to amend their constitution to outlaw political subterfuge that skewed the boundary lines of state legislative and congressional districts to loop in decisive shares of desired voters and dilute the influence of disfavored voters to handily win elections. 
An overwhelming majority of Ohio voters called that deliberate manipulation of district maps cheating and wanted it stopped.
Yet the doubly gerrymandered congressional map hastily approved (without public input) by the redistricting commission Friday dilutes the voting power of big swaths of the electorate in diverse metropolitan communities. 
It grossly betrays Ohioans who trusted their elected representatives to honor the anti-gerrymandering mandate in the constitution by upholding the law. 
Citizens were sold out by ruthless partisan operators determined to steal power any way they could. Silenced in a shameful affront to self-rule. 
But here’s the thing: The redistricting reform amendments passed by voters were drafted by the same legislators behind Ohio’s 2011 gerrymandered maps who never intended to give up control or create fair, competitive districts. 
In the 2020 redistricting process, Ohio Republicans repeatedly defied the constitution and the Ohio Supreme Court with rigged voting maps that illegally gave disproportionate power to one party over the other. 
Now they have done it again with a congressional district map even more gerrymandered than the last. 
They manipulated the maps of two congressional districts, held by incumbent Democrats, to unfairly tip the scales and boost the GOP’s chances of retaining its U.S. House majority next November. 
Their dirty deal, cut behind closed doors with Democratic commissioners, drew higher ratios of Republican voters into Ohio’s 9th and 1st districts to overpower diminished shares of Democratic voters and neutralize their ability to sway elections. 
Controlling Republicans on the panel hailed their bipartisan swindle as proof that the voter-approved redistricting process worked. 
Commission Democrats, who agreed to throw U.S. Reps. Marcy Kaptur and Greg Landsman under the bus with Republican-leaning districts, fished for praise for staving off a worst-case scenario.
 A pox on them all for weakening the collective voting strength of their fellow Ohioans in a self-serving “compromise” rationalized as a political means to an end not policy to advance the public good.

Toledo’s Kaptur, long targeted by Republicans for defeat, got the poorest bet for survival in the new congressional map of the 9th District in northwest Ohio. 
Extreme gerrymandering turned her already red district into a much redder one that will be formidable, if not impossible, for the 79-year-old Democrat (who won her last race by less than 1 percent) to capture in 2026. 
The urban constituency in Landsman’s Cincinnati-based 1st District will be converted into a marginalized minority in a newly jiggered map that scooped up more heavily GOP counties to change the southwest district from one favoring Democrats to one favoring Republicans. 
What happens in the 2026 midterms is anybody’s guess, of course, but there is little doubt about what happened this fall in Ohio and why. 
It is no secret that the GOP fix was in on redrawing congressional maps from the get-go. 
Republicans held all the cards. They planned to steal at least two more U.S. House seats through unconstitutional gerrymandering to score points with the convicted felon in the White House and expand GOP dominance in the state. 
Democrats stooped to a trade-off that saved a third district from being included and insisted it was better than nothing.  
But nowhere, it seems, did the equal voting rights of every Ohioan take precedence in the infuriating redistricting charade that flagrantly disregarded the letter and spirit of the constitutional amendment which explicitly barred partisan gerrymandering      
The result is disenfranchised citizens whose voting power to choose their own representatives has been sacrificed to gerrymandered winning at all costs, damn the democratic consequences.
 Shame on both Republicans and Democrats for breaking faith with Ohio voters on their most fundamental right of self-governance to wield partisan leverage in a political war for control. 
Call it what it is — an epic bipartisan betrayal.

Littman held a strong lead in the race for mayor in early returns. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Jared Littmann’s nearly two-year campaign to become Annapolis mayor appeared to be paying off Tuesday, when he held a commanding lead in early election night returns.
Littmann, a Democrat, had 4,291 votes compared in unofficial results to 1,798 votes for local Republican businessman Bobby O’Shea. The city’s Board of Supervisors of Elections said the counting of mail-in ballots will begin Thursday and election results are scheduled to be certified Nov. 12.
Even with a large lead, Littmann smiled but was calm amid dozens of supporters who shook hands and hugged him during an election night gathering at Level on West Street. Visitors included Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd), state Sen. Pam Beidle (D-Anne Arundel) and Del. Dana Jones (D-Anne Arundel).
“No matter what happens, I have a plan for what’s most likely going to happen, and I have a plan for contingencies at plan B, plan C,” Littmann said.
If he ultimately wins, Littmann has said he wants to complete the city dock project, keep the city in good financial order, improve communication between city government and residents and create a youth council.
Littmann, a small business owner who manages K&B Ace Hardware in the city with his wife, received nearly 2,600 votes in the September Democratic primary over longtime City Council Alderwoman Rhonda Pindell Charles, who got 1,271 in her unsuccessful bid to become the city’s first elected Black mayor.
It took six days for election officials to certify the results from primary election.
O’Shea, who ran unopposed in the Republican primary, relaxed Tuesday night with supporters at Blackwall Hitch in Eastport.

Besides being fiscally responsible and being public servants for everyone, O’Shea said during the campaign that city leaders need to better understand the cause and effect when they pass laws.
“When all of a sudden these things happen, the results aren’t what you think because they haven’t thought it through. We end up with a cluster,” O’Shea said. “Then after we do all this, we don’t enforce or regulate the laws. I’m sorry, that’s not how a city should work.”
Judy Schwartzberg, who opened The Big Cheese in Annapolis with her husband about 30 years ago, said of O’Shea at the election night gathering, “He’s a good man. He has a good name. He will do good for the city.”
With less than 90 minutes before polls closed at 8 p.m., voters such as Joseph Swit and Samantha Watts cast their ballots at the Eastport-Annapolis Neck library.
Swit said housing was one of the issues he wanted to see the next mayor deal with. Watts said the next mayor should support education, especially with Annapolis High School designated a community school this school year.
“We voted for Littman,” Swit said while holding Watts’ hand. “I think he had a more concrete plan for expanding housing options in the city.”
The winner of the mayor’s race will replace current Mayor Gavin Buckley (D), who is term-limited from serving a third, four-year term.
City Council races
The city also had contests in six of eight city wards. In the closest race Tuesday night, Ward 1 Alderman Harry Huntley (D) was trailing unaffiliated candidate Tom Kriek by 10 votes, 576 to 566.

(Stock photo by hapabapa/Getty Images)Maryland will put up $62 million to cover funding for the SNAP food assistance program for November, after the federal government announced Monday that it would only cover about half of the federal program for the month of November.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced the payments Monday to fully cover benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is nnormally funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But he stressed that the state funding is only a temporary solution and said it’s still up to the Trump administrati0n to keep those dollars flowing long term.
“We will continue to do everything in our power to protect our people in these difficult times,” Moore said in a written statement. “But no state can fill the enormous gap created by Donald Trump and his administration. It’s time for the federal government to do its job and fully fund food assistance.”
The $62 million in SNAP funds will be issued under the same declaration of emergency Moore declared last week, when he announced that hte state would make $10 million available for food banks and pantries across the state. The SNAP payments would be in addition to the $10 million, and would go directly to SNAP recipients through their electronic benefits transfer (EBT) accounts.
That said, it is not clear whether either the federal or state dollars will come down in time to avoid a disruption in benefits. If that’s the case, then around 30,000 Marylanders each day may find that their cards were not refilled, starting Tuesday. Maryland awards benefits to recipient on a rolling basis over the course of a month.
Moore responds to SNAP benefits pause with emergency $10 million for food banks

The Monday statement also warns that the Trump administration has not indicated “whether states will receive reimbursement for expenditures to make the program whole.”
The emergency payments come after the USDA abruptly announced last month that it would not be able to use SNAP contingency funds to make November benefit payments during a government shutdown — even though it had made payments during the shutdown in October and had a reported $4.65 billion left in the contingency fund.
That decision was quickly challenged in federal court in separate lawsuits — one by more than two dozen states, including Maryland, and another by a group churches, community groups, labor unions and city governments, including Baltimore City. Judges in both cases ruled separately Friday, ordering the USDA to continue making payments.
The administration has said it does not have enough in the contingency fund to pay for a full month’s worth of benefits, and it sought clarification on the rulings. U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell Jr, in Rhode Island, said in an order Saturday that the USDA could tap other funds and pay full benefits, effective Monday, or could drain the contingency fund and pay partial benefits by Wednesday.
The administration opted to start paying out around 50% of SNAP benefits by Wednesday.
But that may not be soon enough to avoid a disruption in benefits.
In Maryland, benefits are paid out over 20 days, alphabetically according to the recipient’s last name. The first payments for November were scheduled to go our Tuesday, to about 30,000 Marylanders, who may find out that their accounts have not. been refilled for the month, despite the pledge of funding from the Trump and Moore administrations.
It’s not clear how many of the more than 680,000 SNAP recipients may be affected this month.
Both the $62 million for SNAP beneficiaries announced by Moore on Monday and the $10 million he pledged last week to food banks and meal assistance programs will be pulled from the state’s Fiscal Responsibility Fund. Funded by highly volatile capital gains taxes, it is difficult to project revenues in teh fund year to year, but administration officials say the fiscal 2025 closeout was “better than expected” and that about $200 million is sitting in the account.
Several state lawmakers had pressed Moore to dip into the state’s Rainy Day fund to cover the anticipated $123.2 million needed to completely cover November SNAP benefits in the state, as some other governors had promised to do. But Moore rejected that approach, noting that there may be more fiscal challenges ahead for the Trump administration, and that Maryland need to avoid tapping into the Rainy Day fund right away.
Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) also supported using state funds to cover SNAP, as the food assistance benefit also helps in local and state economies.
“SNAP is not only a lifeline for families but also an economic driver, generating more than $187 million in monthly economic impact, helping support over 13,000 jobs, and generating millions of dollars for food producers, farmers, and retailers statewide,” Lierman said in a written statement. “I stand with Governor Moore and our partners across government and the nonprofit sector in working to build a more equitable, resilient, and prosperous state where every Marylander can thrive.”

Wes Moore's job approval numbers remained above 50% and statistitcally flat for the last year, according to a new poll from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. That same poll shows that gap between those who approve of the job the first-term Democrat is doing and those who do not continues to narrow and a growing number of unaffiliated voters say they disapprove of his efforts. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A new poll says a majority of Marylanders say they approve of the job done by Gov. Wes Moore (D) even as they express pessimism about the direction of the state, the economy, and the future.
A poll released Tuesday by the Institute of Politics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County finds Moore sitting above water, with 52% of those surveyed saying they approve of his job performance. Another 44% said they disapprove.
“We have polled on him twice now, once in October — so basically a year ago — and then in February 2025,” said Mileah Kromer, a pollster and director of the institute. “He was sitting at a 54% approval rating in October. It’s at 52% rating in February. So, there’s really no change on that sort of approval top line.”
But beneath the top approval numbers, there is a trend of growing disapproval of the governor’s performance.
“It’s particularly noticeable if you’re comparing October last year to October this year,” Kromer said. “His disapprovals have jumped up” from 32% last year to 44% in the latest poll.
And the gap between those who approve and those who disapprove of Moore’s job performance has narrowed at the same time, from a 22-point margin in October 2024 to a 12-point gap in February until the survey released Tuesday, when there was an 8-point separation between those who approve of Moore’s efforts and those who do not.
“We’re in the middle of a federal government shutdown that the majority of folks think is going to have a negative economic impact on the state,” Kromer said. “And while Wes Moore as an individual, certainly doesn’t have any control over if the government shuts down or not, when people have economic anxiety, oftentimes they express that anxiety on leadership — whether you are responsible or not, whether you have anything to do with it or not.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I think that there certainly has to be some of that at work here,” she said. “I’m not surprised that you see this uptick in disapproval.”
The UMBC poll surveyed 810 Maryland adults, who included 757 registered voters. The poll, conducted Oct. 21-25, has an overall margin of error of 3.4%. The margin of error among registered voters is 3.5%.
Below the surface are continued signs of soft support for Moore as support among independent voters erodes.
Among unaffiliated voters, 56% said they disapprove of Moore, 33% higher than UMBC’s inaugural poll in October 2024. It is the second consecutive UMBC poll showing an increase in unaffiliated voters who disapproved.
“He’s underwater among those … voters.” Kromer said. “They’re an important part of the electorate. But the Democrats are still the biggest show in town in terms of raw numbers.”
In Maryland, registered Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by a 2-1 margin. Nearly 1 million registered voters in the state identify as unaffiliated or independent voters, a voter bloc almost as large as the number of registered Republicans.
Unsurprisingly, Moore does well with Maryland Democrats and continues to struggle with Republicans.
Among Democrats, 78% said they approved of the governor’s performance — a decrease from previous UMBC surveys, though statistically flat.
A small number of Moore’s own party, however, disapprove of his efforts and that number is growing. In the latest survey, 17% of Democrats said they disproved of Moore’s performance, up from 12% in October 2024.
Republicans in the survey continue to overwhelmingly disapprove of Moore, with just 8% of GOP voters approving in the new poll compared to 89% who disapproved.
Marylanders pessimistic about the economy and the future
The survey also showed Marylanders remain pessimistic about the direction of the state overall, as well as the current economic conditions: 48% said the state is on the wrong track, while just four in 10 believed the state is moving in the right direction.

The number of people who said the state is moving in the wrong direction is statistically flat compared to the UMBC February poll. In October 2024, 39% of those who responded said Maryland was moving in the wrong direction.
“These numbers have not budged,” Kromer said, looking back at the last year of polls. “You want those numbers to move, and you want them to move in the other direction.”
Nearly seven in 10 rated the economic condition of the state over the last year as “poor” or “fair.”
Additionally, 55% said they think things will get worse. Thirty-one percent projected the economy would remain about the same. Just 11% said they expected some improvement next year, according to the poll.
“We asked folks to look ahead to the future, and it doesn’t look like they’re all that hopeful,” she said.
Respondents to the poll were asked to identify their biggest concern about the Maryland economy. The top six responses were all pocketbook issues ranging from taxes and government spending to the government shutdown, cost of living, and housing costs.
In a separate question, those polled were asked about seven key economic indicators. More than nine of 10 said they were very or somewhat concerned about the costs of groceries and consumer goods.
Costs of health care and insurance came in at 89%, followed by the cost of household electricity at 88%. The ability to find a good-paying job came in at 86%. Seventy-nine percent worried about the cost of housing and more than six in 10 said the price of gasoline was a concern. Concerns about the performance of the stock market came in last at 53%.
Marylanders are also concerned about the ongoing federal shutdown. On Tuesday, the standoff enters its 35th day, becoming the longest shutdown in the country’s history.
The poll was conducted roughly a month into the ongoing federal government shutdown.
More than six-in-ten said they believe the shutdown will have a major impact on the state. Three in ten said the shutdown will have a major impact on their personal finances, and another 37% said it will have a minor impact.
Blame for shutdown falls along partisan lines
Those surveyed are laying blame for the shutdown. Not surprisingly, that blame falls squarely along party lines with 84 % of Democrats blaming President Donald Trump and Republicans while 82% of Republicans blame congressional Democrats.
Trump remains unpopular in Maryland. According to the poll, 67% said they disapproved of his job performance compared to 32% that said they approved. The approval number is slightly lower than the 34% of people who cast their ballots for Trump in Maryland during the 2024 election.
“His numbers just have not budged,” Kromer said. “Over the years that I’ve polled on him. — not just here, but my previous institution — they just have not budged. Even in other public polls, he is usually right around the low 30 as his approval rating in Maryland. It’s mostly Republicans, some independents or unaffiliated voters, and a very teeny, tiny number of Democrats.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_4297-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-04 00:16:48.846908

That leaves just under four hours of silence in a full 24-hour cycle—hardly enough time for uninterrupted sleep, let alone peace of mind.
The Metro-North Railroad is an essential artery for commuters in the region. Its role in connecting suburban areas to New York City is undeniable. But the price of progress shouldn’t be paid in sleepless nights and compromised quality of life for those who live in its shadow.
While train service is necessary, a balance must be struck between transportation efficiency and community well-being. There are proven mitigation strategies: noise-reducing barriers, modernized trains with quieter braking systems, and stricter horn-use policies in residential zones. This responsibility doesn’t just fall on Metro-North but also the City of Milford and the Connecticut Department of Transportation. Since 2022, the Metro-North Waterbury train service has increased by 47% with $140 million being invested in the line’s infrastructure.
Train noise abatement isn’t a new topic for the CT DOT given that in 2019, the CTDOT installed a new Wayside Horn System along the New Haven to Hartford Line rail corridor to reduce the noise given the increase in train traffic. Wayside horns are triggered at the crossing site and set up in a way to reduce the sound of the horns.  If it can be done on the Hartford line, why not the Bridgeport/Waterbury line?
Metro-North and regional planning authorities must engage more proactively with impacted neighborhoods. Transparency about schedules, timelines for upgrades, and noise-reduction efforts should be standard. More importantly, Milford residents need a seat at the table when decisions are made about future service expansions or changes.

This diagram illustrates the substantial difference in how far noise can be heard from train mounted-horns versus wayside horns (referred to as “Automated Horn System.”) Credit: CDOT
The current schedule effectively leaves residents with less than four hours of guaranteed quiet time each day. That is neither sustainable nor humane. A modern transportation system should not come at the cost of basic human comfort and health. It’s time to acknowledge that 20-hour train service might serve commuters well, but it’s failing the people who live beside it.

So where’s the support?,Katy Mulvaney,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/04/faculty-matter-most-so-wheres-the-support/,"Faculty “is the #1 predictor for student return, retention, and graduation, above and beyond all other factors.","Fifteen minutes into my office hours on a Wednesday, I finally gave up on checking my emails. I had spent the previous twenty minutes trying (and failing) to sign out of my Quinnipiac account and into the one at Southern Connecticut State University. Unfortunately, both use the same program for email and grading. Blackboard, in particular, insisted on redirecting me to the Quinnipiac account every time I tried to sign on to the account for Southern.
At the time, I worked as an adjunct at both places, cobbling together a more-than-full-time job but without the benefits or stability. And it was driving me up the wall.
I eventually figured out a work-around where I used an incognito browser window for one set of log-ins and the default browser settings for the other university. Another colleague told me that she used a combination of Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari for the same workaround. 
But honestly? Signing in was the least of my worries as an adjunct professor.
Every university where I’ve taught first year writing has wanted something at least a little different. Quinnipiac is all about the revision process. Southern is more about analyzing arguments. Simmons University cared more about literature and relating reading to the students’ lives. Merrimack College wanted me to teach research methods, literary analysis, personal narrative, formal research papers, and informal modern communication (yes, all in one semester).
It can be mind-melting to develop reading lists that allow me to teach each of these different courses at the same time. Readings that work for Week 5 of each very different course are hard to find, but doing that is the only way I can avoid collapsing under the weight of each week of prep.
CSU-AAUP, the union for full and part-time faculty at the four Connecticut State Universities, is currently in a contract battle that has already been drawn out comically long. The Central Office took over a year to agree to meeting dates.
But now, they are finally willing to talk to us about the problems faced by part-time faculty at our next bargaining session on Nov. 4.
Hopefully, they will listen to tales of the stress that low pay, non-guaranteed class schedules, and absolutely no safety net for personal life events cause for us part-time faculty. Even when we’re not sick, or having babies, or wondering whether our classes will be cut at the last moment, the ordinary mental load of working at multiple universities is exhausting.
And it’s making me worse at my job.
I’m an excellent teacher. I work beyond my hours to be one. I have fabulous evaluations to show for it and, more importantly, students who have made real progress over the course of a single semester. I also have glowing evaluations from peers and supervisors.
But being an adjunct means there are things I can’t and even shouldn’t do to help my students. Little things, but they add up. 
For example, I can’t advise students on campus policies or give academic advice for students’ schedules. There is no way I could advise students on English department requirements or even the process for using the Testing Center/Writing Center. Not without giving students bad advice at some point, as all the different policies and practices from multiple campuses get jumbled together in my brain.
It would be irresponsible for me to try to keep it all straight and offer advice, knowing I would inevitably get something confused.
I also can’t accommodate times outside my office hours or guarantee that I’ll have the ability to answer emails every day of the week. If I was on a different campus, even my incognito browser sometimes insisted on sticking to Quinnipiac servers. One week, I had to wait until my next physical trip to Southern, because Blackboard wouldn’t let me sign in remotely at all.
This is a waste of my time, of course. Unpaid labor, bureaucratic inefficiencies, all being passed down to those with less power. It also means that I can’t be the force for retention that the Board of Regents claims they want. 
Keeping students beyond the first year of college has become an urgent goal for not just the CSU system, but almost every institution of higher education. And the data is in: it’s not flashy initiatives, fancy dorms, or endless theme mixers that move the needle. It’s faculty.
A survey study published in the Journal of the International Society for Teacher Education found that faculty “is the #1 predictor for student return, retention, and graduation, above and beyond all other factors, including systemic infrastructure, counseling center access, academic success center, scholarship, alcohol, work-study program, on-campus housing” – programs, I should note, that the Board of Regents often seems more interested in funding than payment structures that would ensure faculty retention.
Besides risking some of its best part-time faculty to burnout and the kind of bone-deep frustration that comes with being consistently undervalued, taking advantage of contingent adjuncts has a cost in these retention-forward tactics. Things that move the needle, like learning student names early on, meeting with students outside of class, frequent assessments, and offering students flexibility (care of Inside Higher Ed) are harder for faculty that have to juggle multiple campuses, course structures, bureaucracies, and student bodies.
I keep office hours and mentor students who can show up at those times. I do my best with names and have gotten better over the years. But a full-time lecturer, even outside of the tenure track, could do more. A full-timer can keep track of the questions that freshmen always need answered. A full-timer can give confident advice for the single campus that they know well. A full-timer can be more reliably available.
A full-timer can help students feel like they belong. 
But if I don’t belong to one campus, then there’s a limit to how much I can ever make a student feel like they do.

Brown/Maryland Matters)When it celebrates its 25th anniversary next week, Progressive Maryland will be looking back on its successes in the state, but in the current political climate it’s hard to imagine there won’t be a fair amount of looking forward, too.
Executive Director Larry Stafford said the Nov. 13 gala at the DoubleTree hotel in Columbia will celebrate the organization’s history, but also serve as a call to action.
“We’re celebrating 25 years of Progressive Maryland, the progress we have been able to make as a state,” Stafford said Friday. “In doing so at a time while we are facing … incredibly turbulent times.”
The organization has several chapters in the state, including some in more conservative areas, like Harford County and the Lower Shore. In the last legislative session, it threw its support behind proposals for renter protections and criminal justice reforms. It is currently pushing for the state to redraw its congressional districts map in hopes of picking up a Democratic seat in response to Republican states that have redrawn their districts for partisan gain.
That move is opposed by Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), who called mid-cycle redistricting “too risky” because it could wind up costing Democrats a seat. That drew a rebuke from Progressive Maryland, which called on the Senate to “pick up this fight on … redistricting.”

“Sen. Ferguson needs to recognize that these are unprecedented times that we’re living in right now,” Stafford said. “Currently, as we’re seeing Republicans and many states are rushing to redraw maps to rig the mid-term elections, we can’t take chances here in Maryland to not do everything within our power to make sure that we’re in this national fight to save our democracy.”
In political campaigns, Progressive Maryland has backed Prince George’s County Executive Aisha Braveboy (D)  and it helped former NAACP president Ben Jealous emerge from a crowded Democratic field to win the 2018 gubernatorial nomination. It supported Marc Elrich, an avowed Democratic Socialist, in his successful bid for Montgomery County executive, and has backed Dels. Shelia Ruth (D-Baltimore County) and Jamila Woods (D-Prince George’s), Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D) and several current county, municipal and school board members.
The guest speaker for next week’s gala will be U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who’s being recognized for his work pushing for lower prescription drug costs and affordable health care, among other topics. Van Hollen has also emerged as one of the most outspoken critics of the Trump administration, for its action against offshore wind projects, its treatment of federal workers and its immigration policies, including the high-profile deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.
“We’ve had great success in the electoral arena in the last 25 years that has completely changed the landscape of Maryland politics,” Stafford said. “Progressive Maryland exists as a place where multiple organizations that make up the left in Maryland come together to do work to guide the state in a more progressive direction.”
Shake-up at BGE

The utility last week named John Haysbert its next vice president of governmental and external affairs. Haysbert has served in similar roles at Hitachi Energy and Duke Energy Corp. Most recently, he was managing partner of public policy and external affairs at the Achis Group, where he handled external affairs for Fortune 500 companies.
“We are very happy to welcome John as VP of Governmental and External Affairs at BGE,” said Valencia McClure, senior vice president of governmental, regulatory and external affairs at Exelon.
“John’s expertise in energy policy, stakeholder engagement, and external affairs will be instrumental as we continue to strengthen our relationships with policymakers and communities in Maryland,” she said. “His leadership will help ensure BGE remains a trusted partner by delivering timely, accurate information and advocating for policies that support our customers and the communities we serve.”
Haysbert, who started Monday, replaces Charles Washington, a BGE spokesman confirmed. Earlier this year, Exelon named McClure to her current position for BGE, Pepco and Delmarva Power, Exelon’s Maryland utilities. She replaced Alex Nunez in the role at BGE, the spokesman said.
LGBTQIA+ survey
The Maryland Commission for LGBTQIA+ Affairs opened a survey last month for individuals in the state who may need housing, mental health or any other supports.
The anonymous survey for those 18 and older is being conducted in partnership with the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore. Among the questions, the survey asks whether a person “changed or attempted to change” their sex or gender on a Maryland birth certificate; how familiar they are with “state policies and legal protections for LGBTQIA+ Marylanders”; and “To what extent do you feel connected to an LGBTQIA+ community (or communities) in MD?”
Lee Blinder, a member of the commission and founding executive director of Trans Maryland, said in an interview Monday that the survey comes at a time when Trump administration continues to target the LGBTQIA+ community. Maryland is seen as having some of the best protections in the country for the LGBTQ community, but Blinder said more work must be done, which is part of the reason for the survey.
“We know how important access to accurate data is for our community in such a targeted time that the federal administration is very specifically targeting the LGBTQIA+ community, in particular the trans community,” Blinder said. “We’re anecdotally hearing really desperate situations for community members, for families with LGBTQIA+ people here in Maryland.”
The survey will be open until Dec. 1. Once done, results will be reviewed and tabulated with the goal of presenting some of the data to the General Assembly when it convenes Jan. 14.
One bill that didn’t advance in the 2025 legislative session was the Birth Certificate Modernization Act, which sought to make it easier for transgender people to make changes to their birth certificates, among other measures. Transgender advocates have been pushing that bill for the last few years.
“I don’t have a single day that goes by a trans community member is reaching out to tell me that they are scared, that they are really worried about their ability to move around in public life,” Blinder said. “That’s a weighted burden to go around with, so what we want to be able to do is empower those individuals and our community to say this is what resources we need and we have to have tangible investment in this community.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC07072-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-04 09:19:08.555031

Restoring underwater grasses, and the many benefits they provide, is a key part of the plan to restore the Chesapeake Bay. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Planting underwater grasses in the Chesapeake Bay is easier than you might think.
After mixing the plants’ tiny, spherical seeds with a bucket of sand, the mixture is simply tossed off a boat into a targeted area, handful by handful. Last week, their landing zone was the Severn River, a short boat ride from Smith’s Marina in Crownsville.
The hard part is getting to the point of tossing sand and seed overboard.
Scientists must harvest the seeds from plants when they bloom in the summertime, by wading into shallow sections of bay tributaries.
“We throw everybody in the water with a wetsuit and a laundry basket, and we literally walk around in circles,” said Mark Lewandowski, a scientist with Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources. “We rip off the top of the plant — at the top of the reproductive shoot — and throw it in.”
Each outing collects 20 to 30 laundry baskets full of plant material, Lewandowski said.
“Basically, we’re acting like geese or birds of prey — coming in and taking off those seeds from the top, leaving the root system,” said Elle Bassett, the riverkeeper for the South, West and Rhode rivers.
Bassett’s organization, the Arundel Rivers Federation, collected 7.5 million seeds this past summer. Some have been planted this fall, including the 2,000 seeds from a species called sago pondweed that were distributed in the Severn during a recent trip. But others will be saved for the springtime, Bassett said.

After they’re collected from the plant, the seeds must go to a turbulator, a hot tub-like machine that separates the seeds from the shoots.
“We pump air through the PVC [pipe] system and agitate it just like a washing machine,” Lewandowski said. “We take a batch of seed, we dump it in and we tear it by hand, we rip it with rakes. And the object is to get all the seeds to fall to the bottom.”
To the environmentalists and scientists who make it happen, the effort is worth it — largely because of the many benefits that beds of underwater grasses provide.
Known to scientists as submerged aquatic vegetation, or SAV, the plants provide critical shelter to beloved bay species, including vulnerable molting blue crabs and young striped bass, and are also a food source for small invertebrates and migratory waterfowl.
The plants absorb excess nutrients — the villains behind the algae blooms that cause “dead zones” in the bay each summer. They can also trap sediment to slow coastline erosion, balance pH and even sequester globe-warming carbon.
The plants once coated the bottom of the Chesapeake Bay, but declined dramatically beginning decades ago, as forests and natural lands became cities and neighborhoods, and human activity clouded the water with nutrient and sediment pollution, blocking sunlight that bay grasses need to thrive.
That’s why reseeding the underwater vegetation has long been a part of the multistate agreements to restore the Chesapeake Bay, the newest of which is speeding toward final approval at the end of this year.
Chesapeake grass goals revised
In 2014, the states surrounding the bay all pledged to increase underwater grasses’ footprint in the bay to 130,000 acres by 2025, with an eventual goal of reaching 185,000 acres. But the latest annual aerial survey of the grass beds by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, in 2024, estimated grass coverage for the Chesapeake at 82,778 acres.
The footprint had been increasing steadily since 2012, but intense rainfall in 2018 and 2019 knocked back seagrasses significantly, and the grasses’ footprint has been slowly building back up ever since.
Brooke Landry, who serves as the submerged aquatic vegetation program chief at the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, said that the original goal for 2025 failed to take into account just how difficult it would be to restore grasses as climate change worsened and development increased, inundating the bay with more nutrient pollution than expected.

“Despite all of that pressure, and climate change, the fact that we’ve increased [grasses] at all is a huge testament that what we’re doing is working,” said Landry, who added that she appreciates the new goals in this year’s agreement.
Under that agreement, which is expected to be approved by Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and other bay-state leaders in December, the parties set an interim goal of 100,000 acres by 2040. But the document states that a higher acreage than previously expected would be needed for a restored bay — 196,600 acres, divided between the different salinity zones in the bay, which host different  species of grasses.
During a public comment period for the new agreement, some environmentalists expressed frustration that goals in a variety of categories were too low, mainly so that they would be achievable, including the vegetation goal.
Landry said plantings are just one part of the overall strategy to hit the targets. Ecosystem managers also work to protect and strengthen existing grass beds, and improve water quality and clarity to encourage new beds to grow.
But the hope is that sprinkling seeds in areas that appear ripe for more underwater grass growth will help the grasses spread to new areas. Scientists must choose the areas they harvest carefully, Landry said, to ensure they aren’t unduly harming an existing bed.
Landry said they look for beds that are thick, with a density rating between 70% and 100%, and have persisted for at least five years.
“Hopefully, the bed is going to recover and come back annually — it’s not going to make an impact,” Bassett said. “Instead … we’re taking a portion of that seed and trying to replicate that bed in an area that wouldn’t otherwise have the bed.”
The planting process has evolved over time, said Mike Naylor, a scientist with the department. Years ago, ecosystem managers took a far more difficult path — placing entire plants into the Chesapeake, instead of merely tossing seeds overboard.
“We were growing whole plants in a lab, classrooms and different settings, and bringing them out and planting them,” said Naylor, a longtime department veteran. “So, that is extremely labor intensive: Carrying a plant that has to stay wet from one place to another, and getting it in a boat, getting out to plant it. It just was too slow.”

Riverkeepers and vegation watchers 
In addition to a new strategy, state officials also have new partners, Naylor said, thanks to the emergence over the last few decades of more and more nonprofit organizations that care for individual rivers around the watershed, including riverkeeper groups.
Riverkeeper groups help supplement the work of the state’s small aquatic vegetation crew, Naylor said. In some cases, riverkeepers and other nonprofits are the ones who can find the money for a restoration project, and they actually hire  staffers from the natural resources department to perform the work in the rivers.
“We couldn’t do the work we do without them,” Naylor said.
The Chesapeake Bay Program also coordinates a program called SAV Watchers, which commissions and trains citizen scientists to analyze the grass  beds — from shorelines, kayaks or small boats.
The program allows officials to vet the Virginia Institute of Marine Science annual aerial survey, which Landry said has been going on since 1984.
“In 2017, we started talking about needing to ground-truth this survey more thoroughly. We needed to know about the species composition of the beds. We wanted to get volunteers and riverkeepers involved,” Landry said. “And that’s when we developed the SAV Watcher program.”
The program attracted considerable interest among Anne Arundel County residents during the coronavirus pandemic, said Bassett, who estimates that she recruited about 50 new volunteers into the program during a two-year period.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Everyone was like: ‘How can I get out of the house and do something?’” Bassett said. “And it was like: Here is this really individual volunteer science program that you can do on your own time outside. And it really grew from there.”
The program has armed scientists with key data, including by alerting them to the fact that a species called horned pondweed was present in greater numbers in the bay than originally thought. The species often wasn’t captured in the aerial surveys because it grows on a slightly different seasonal schedule than other bay grasses.
But Landry said the other perk of the program is how it has increased awareness around the need for the grasses.
“Folks that get involved, they become personally invested in the SAV off of their shorelines or in their rivers,” Landry said.
Bassett said she’s been inspired to hear from older residents of the bay watershed at community meetings, who recount days when grasses covered the bottom of the Chesapeake, so much so that boaters sometimes had to rip grasses from the bottom to pass by.
“I’ve never experienced that in my lifetime, but I would love for my kids to experience that,” Bassett said. “And that’s the goal — right? — of being a riverkeeper: Making it better for a future generation.”

Gonzalvo/U.S. Navy)A new report says Maryland should press forward with plans for a nonemergency 311 call system assisted by artificial intelligence, to reduce the number of nonemergency calls to 911 while more efficiently answering residents’ questions.
Maryland would be the first state in the nation with such a system, according to the 23-page report released Saturday by the Workgroup to Study Implementation of an Expanded 3-1-1 Nonemergency System. The report proposes a phased approach that would begin with systems in four counties using AI chatbots, ultimately expanding to a statewide system employing AI voice bots.
Sen. Cheryl Kagan (D-Montgomery), who chaired the work group, said Monday the recommendations will be crafted into legislation she will sponsor with Sen. Paul Corderman (R-Washington and Frederick) in the coming legislative session. The report does not discuss how to pay for the system, which Kagan estimates could cost $2.5 million for the two-year phase-in.
“We are going to be pinching our pennies pretty hard this year as we face significant budget challenges,” she said. “I realize that very few programs are likely to be created. This is one makes sense.”
A companion House bill will be introduced by Del. Lesley Lopez (D-Montgomery) and Del. Nic Kipke (R-Anne Arundel).
“AI is obviously evolving quickly. It has a lot of advantages, especially as it relates to finding of information,” Kipke said. “We currently, in some parts of the state, have a 311 system where people can connect and access information. This definitely would take it to the next level.”

According to the report, a nonemergency system would not only redude 911 calls, but would also improve access to government services for those in rural jurisdictions and leverage AI technology to modernize services and reduce costs.
Six jurisdictions currently offer some form of 311 service: Baltimore, Anne Arundel, Montgomery, Prince George’s and St. Mary’s counties and Baltimore City. The workgroup called for a system boosted by an AI chatbot to be rolled out in two of those jurisdictions and in two counties that do not now have a 311 system. It also called for creationg of an oversight board within the Maryland Information Network (MDInfoNet), which already manages statewide nonemergency referral services.
The next would be adding A1-powered voice bot technology to serve residents “who prefer phone interactions or lack digital access.” Some of the performance indicators would be to assess the percentage of calls resolved without human intervention, changes in staffing needs and caller wait times and customer satisfaction.
Finally, a move toward statewide expansion would be based on a comprehensive evaluation by the oversight board of the cost effectiveness, equity in service and integration challenges of the service, among other things.
The report estimates the entire process to implement the program could take up to two years.
Some ideas could come from jurisdictions that already have nonemergency systems.
Baltimore City established the first nonemergency system in the country in 1996.  Balt311 operates from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. and allows residents to report problems or submit requests such as trash pickup, a dead animal removal and water leak repairs. There’s no AI integration in the system, so residents can either speak with a live agent, go online, or go through a mobile app.
St. Mary’s County created a web-based service five years ago for residents to report problems or submits requests using an interactive map. Unlike the other counties, it does not have a phone service, but is web-only.
“This in-state assessment demonstrates that Maryland already has a strong base of operational experience, ranging from Baltimore’s mature system to newer and more limited platforms like St. Mary’s,” the report said.
“At the same time, counties without 3-1-1 highlight the risks of uneven access,” it said. “Together, these findings suggest that a coordinated statewide model could both build on existing investments and ensure more equitable service delivery across jurisdictions.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/8907398-1024x731.jpg,,,2025-11-04 03:16:31.922635

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)RAPID CITY — South Dakota’s governor said Monday he does not support using state money to fill a funding gap in a food assistance program during the federal government shutdown, and said he was unaware of a funding request that a hunger relief organization submitted to the Legislature.
Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden made the comments in response to South Dakota Searchlight questions while he was volunteering at Feeding South Dakota’s Rapid City food distribution center.
Because Congress has failed to pass a bill to fund and reopen the federal government, the Trump administration has said it won’t be able to provide all of this month’s benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP.
The program provides about 75,000 low-income South Dakotans with money loaded onto cards they can use to buy food. The cards are loaded on the 10th day of each month.
A full month of benefits in South Dakota requires about $15 million of federal funding. Rhoden said the state cannot afford to replace any of those funds.
“First of all, we don’t have that kind of coin running around to do that for any extended period of time,” Rhoden said. “Second to that, the federal government has made it clear that those dollars won’t be reimbursable. And I don’t think it’s fair to put that on the backs of taxpayers.”
Democrats ask governor to tap reserves
Democratic legislators sent Rhoden a letter last week urging him to authorize the use of reserve funds to temporarily cover any lapse in federal SNAP funding.
“Now is the time to rise above federal-level politics and stand united for the people we serve,” said the letter, signed by Senate Minority Leader Liz Larson and House Minority Leader Erin Healy, both of Sioux Falls.
Trump administration to pay about half of November SNAP benefits amid shutdown

The state had $492 million in reserve when the 2025 fiscal year ended on June 30, according to a report from the governor’s budget office. Legislators and Rhoden have since approved a transfer of about $79 million to help fund construction of a new men’s prison in Sioux Falls, leaving over $400 million in what’s commonly described as the state’s “rainy day” fund.
State Rep. Erik Muckey, D-Sioux Falls, is a member of the Legislature’s budget committee. Muckey said in an interview with Searchlight that he appreciates the governor’s devotion to fiscal responsibility and shares Rhoden’s wish that Congress would end the federal shutdown.
Muckey disagrees with Rhoden’s opposition to using state reserves for SNAP.
“We have the funds to be able to support that if we’re needing to,” Muckey said. “If feeding hungry South Dakotans at a time when the federal government may not be fully funding it doesn’t constitute a ‘rainy day,’ what does?”
Instead of tapping reserves, the governor is calling for private donations and volunteerism to help food banks and churches fill the need.
“I’m hopeful that people will step up,” Rhoden said.
Request from Feeding South Dakota
Feeding South Dakota, the largest hunger-relief nonprofit in the state, asked the Legislature’s budget committee four months ago to consider a $3 million appropriation to the organization when lawmakers gather in January for the annual legislative session. The request came in response to federal spending cuts earlier this year that cost the organization more than a million pounds of food.
When Searchlight asked Rhoden on Monday if he plans to include the request in the annual budget he’ll propose next month, the governor said he has “not heard any talk about that,” adding that he met with legislative leaders about the budget recently and “none of that was brought up.”
Asked whether he would support the idea if it’s formally proposed to him, Rhoden said, “I wouldn’t comment whether I’d support legislation I’ve not seen yet.”

Feeding South Dakota operates multiple distribution centers across the state providing about 14 million pounds of food annually. Lori Dykstra, the organization’s CEO, said she was not able to attend Rhoden’s visit to the Rapid City center. Afterward, Dykstra said she is “disappointed” to hear that the organization’s funding request has not reached the governor.
Since making the request, she said, the organization has seen a steady increase in requests for food and now needs $5 million “to meet the moment and to be able to stay ahead of this.”
“We have the infrastructure to do the work, but we don’t have the food,” Dykstra said. “We don’t have the resources.”
For every one meal that Feeding South Dakota provides to South Dakotans, Dykstra added, SNAP provides nine.
SNAP funding is in peril because Congress is locked in a stalemate over a spending bill and did not appropriate money for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. As recently as last week, Trump administration officials said that without passage of a spending bill, they could not fund SNAP benefits beyond Oct. 31.
On Monday, in response to court rulings in multiple lawsuits, the administration said it will pay for a portion of November benefits from a contingency fund that holds about $5.5 billion. About $9 billion is needed to cover a full month of SNAP benefits nationwide, leaving states with choices about whether and how to fill the gap.
North Dakota recently responded by devoting $1.5 million to address food insecurity, including $915,000 for the Great Plains Food Bank. Some other states are temporarily providing state-funded assistance directly to SNAP recipients.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)The campaign to unionize Amazon has set its sights on Durham, with Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment launching an organizing drive outside the company’s RDU5 warehouse on Monday.
This represents CAUSE’s second union push in the state, with the first in Garner resulting in an election defeat by a three-to-one margin in February that organizers challenged with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging the company coerced its employees into voting no and violated protections for union organizing. That election complaint remains ongoing.
Around 50 demonstrators rallied in support of the campaign kickoff at the truck entrance of the RDU5 facility on Monday afternoon, handing out union materials to workers finishing their shifts and raising their fists to delivery trucks honking in approval.
“I came to tell you we didn’t lose, we learned,” CAUSE President Ryan Brown told supporters.
“They thought they had buried us, but all they did was plant us,” Brown said. “And the thing about seeds is that seeds, they will always rise. They rise in Garner, they rise in Raleigh, and Durham, and Winston-Salem, and in Charlotte.”
Organizers said the campaign will target four facilities in the Durham area, including the RDU5 warehouse and three others. The union estimates that RDU5 has around 1,000 employees, while the other three each range in the hundreds.
“The good thing about Durham is that the facilities are smaller,” CAUSE Secretary Italo Medelius said in an interview. “Bringing all of these facilities together will give people a lot more solidarity to share strategies, to talk about what’s going on inside these warehouses, so we feel very, very confident that this campaign is going to turn out differently.”

A key tenet of the campaign is fairer wages. According to the union campaign, workers start at $18.50 an hour — less than half of what MIT estimates constitutes a living wage for a single-income family with one child in the Durham area — and caps at $22 an hour, regardless of experience.
At the RDU1 facility in Garner, pay begins at $18.50 and goes up to $23.80, Amazon spokesperson Marc Heintzman said in a statement in February. But he added that “pay is not capped” and that the company raises hourly wages every year.
Supporters with the Union of Southern Service Workers and other area unions joined Monday’s event in solidarity, as did Durham City Council Member Nate Baker. The Durham City Council passed a resolution in June that “enthusiastically encourages” Amazon workers in the city to unionize.
“The city of Durham stands behind you in this fight!” Baker said to cheers. “What’s your wage? It should be higher. What’s your leave? It should be longer. You deserve better.”
Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Durham union campaign, but in statements earlier this year during the Garner effort, spokesperson Eileen Hards said the company supports all employees’ right to decide whether to participate in a union.
“Our employees have the choice of whether or not to join a union,” Hards said in February. “We believe that both decisions should be equally protected which is why we talk openly, candidly and respectfully about these topics, actively sharing facts with employees so they can use that information to make an informed decision.”
She added that Amazon believes employees will find joining a union unnecessary and “favor opportunities to have their unique voice heard by working directly with our team.”
“The fact is, Amazon already offers what many unions are requesting: safe, inclusive workplaces, competitive pay, industry-leading benefits — including health care on day one, pre-paid college tuition, and a 401k with company match — opportunities for career growth, and more,” Hards said.

To date, the only successful union campaign at an Amazon warehouse took place in a New York shipping facility in 2022, led by the Amazon Labor Union. No other unions have won recognition by the NLRB to negotiate on behalf of Amazon warehouse employees.
Jorge Meza, a worker at the RDU5 facility who volunteered with the union effort, said he’s pleased that the campaign has come to Durham. “I think it’s a really smart move. Durham has a rich history of labor organizing, organizing within intersectional communities here.”
Medelius, the union secretary, said part of the learning process from the first campaign was getting an in-depth understanding of the Durham facilities beforehand. That has resulted in a multilingual campaign, with pro-union signs in Spanish, Nepali, and Arabic present at the rally, reflecting the diversity of the warehouse workers.
“We feel strong enough inside of all those facilities that if Amazon wants to retaliate, we’re ready to jump in the boxing ring with them,” Medelius said. “We’re here to announce that we’re not going anywhere and we’re going to unionize.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PB034862-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-03 20:57:33.422997

(Pool photo by Trent Nelson/The Salt Lake Tribune) With less than a week to go before the Nov. 10 deadline to decide which map will set Utah’s congressional boundaries for the 2026 election, a Utah judge will be back in the courtroom this week to hear oral arguments in the state’s ongoing redistricting legal battle. 
The lawsuit’s plaintiffs, according to court documents, are asking 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson to do four things:

Block SB1011, a law that the Utah Legislature passed last month along with their preferred map (known as map C) requiring that three specific statistical tests be used to evaluate congressional maps. The plaintiffs argue those tests were “cherry picked” to ensure maps that favor the state’s majority party, the Republican party, will pass. 
Declare the Legislature’s map C “fails to abide by and conform with the requirements of Proposition 4” — a ballot initiative that passed in 2018 requiring an independent redistricting process and setting neutral map-drawing criteria —  and therefore block it from being used. The plaintiffs argue the new law likely violates their constitutional rights to alter and reform their government with Proposition 4 since it “impairs” the voter-approved law that the courts have upheld. 
Declare that the 2011 congressional map — the most recent map the Legislature has enacted during regular redistricting processes other than the 2021 map, which the courts have voided — also be blocked because it wouldn’t meet today’s population requirements. 
Order the Legislature to enact one of the plaintiffs’ maps to conduct Utah’s congressional elections. 

The plaintiffs asked the court take on the “unwelcome task” of voiding the map C and picking an alternative map because the Legislature has “failed” to comply with Proposition 4 and has left the court “no choice but to exercise its obligation to ensure that Utahns cast ballots under a congressional map” that adheres to both federal and state constitutional requirements. 
Utah Legislature picks congressional map supported by Republican party

“Instead of simply enacting a compliant map, the Legislature rushed through a law that
would give cover for a non-compliant map,” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote in court documents submitted late last week. “The result of this latest effort to exempt itself from Prop 4’s anti-gerrymandering requirements was SB1011 and its three biased tests that cut to the core of the anti-gerrymandering purpose of Prop 4.” 
The Legislature’s attorneys, however, argue the judge should pick the Legislature’s preferred map, arguing it was drawn under Proposition 4’s standards and does not “purposefully or unduly favor any partisan outcome.” 
They also defend SB1011 as lawmakers’ “good-faith effort to define key (and vague) terms in Proposition 4” while exercising their “discretion” to decide what constitutes the “best available data and scientific and statistical methods” to use in evaluating redistricting plans. 
Both the plaintiffs and the Legislature’s attorneys argue the opposing sides’ maps are “partisan outliers,” pointing to competing redistricting experts’ testimony as evidence that the other sides’ maps were designed to favor one party over another. 
“Plaintiffs’ plans do not satisfy the Legislature’s chosen standards. At best, their plans are not as fair as the 2025 Plan and, at worst, their plans are themselves purposeful partisan gerrymanders,” the Legislature’s attorneys wrote, adding that the two-day evidentiary hearings last month “confirmed” that the Legislature’s map is “lawful” and the plaintiff’s maps are “extreme partisan outliers.” 
The plaintiffs, however, argue expert testimony showed the Legislature’s map unduly and purposefully favors the Republican party and disfavors the Democratic Party, while also violating Proposition 4’s requirement to minimize the divisions of cities and counties across multiple districts. 
Plaintiffs submit 2 congressional maps to judge as Utah lawmakers vote on their own

The plaintiffs also contend that the Legislature’s map should be disqualified because lawmakers’ map architect — Sean Trende, senior elections analyst for Real Clear Politics — said during cross-examination that he had partisan election data turned on in the map-drawing tool called Dave’s Redistricting App when he was drawing map C. 
They noted that Sen. Scott Sandall, R-Tremonton, who co-chaired the Legislative Redistricting Committee that recommended map C, has for years objected to members of the public using Dave’s Redistricting App because the program by default displays partisan political data as users draw maps.  
“It was thus remarkable that the Legislature’s mapdrawer, Dr. Sean Trende, testified on direct examination that he had not considered political data in drawing Map C, only to admit on cross examination that he not only used (the tool) to draw Map C, but displayed partisan political data — both for the districts and for each precinct under consideration for inclusion or exclusion in a district — on the computer screen while he drew the map,” the plaintiffs attorneys wrote. 
“In other words,” the plaintiffs’ attorneys added, “the Legislature’s mapdrawer did precisely what Sen. Sandall warned was disqualifying for maps considered by the Legislature.” 
The Legislature’s attorneys, however, argue that even though Trende drew the map on Dave’s Redistricting Application, the default political data included composite data spanning the 2012 to 2020 elections, and the “data was all but meaningless” because it was outdated. 
“It did not (and could not) allow him to draw the map with the purpose to favor any political party,” legislative attorneys wrote. As lawmakers held public hearings while considering maps, they “avoided the use and discussion of partisan information throughout the legislative process.” 
In arguments against the plaintiffs’ two proposed maps, the Legislature’s attorneys sought to discredit a map analysis from one of the plaintiffs’ retained redistricting experts, Jowei Chen. 
Plaintiffs’ expert in Utah redistricting case calls Legislature’s map an ‘extreme partisan outlier’

“Dr. Chen generated 10,000 simulated Utah congressional maps using an algorithm he modified specifically for this case — an algorithm that no other computational redistricting expert uses,” legislative attorneys wrote, adding that his algorithm is “neither publicly available nor open source,” and that Chen “refused to answer in the affirmative when asked repeatedly whether his algorithm produced a representative sample of possible Utah congressional maps drawn in compliance with the law.” 
Lawmakers’ attorneys added that Chen’s algorithm “repeatedly produces a district centered in the same region of northern Salt Lake County,” which they argued is evidence of “systematic geographic bias.” As a result, they argued that his algorithm “anchored a heavily Democratic district in the same portion of northern Salt Lake County in more than 90% of his simulated maps.” 
But the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote that Chen’s algorithm was created “specifically to comply” with Proposition 4’s criteria without incorporating any racial or political data. They assert that his computer-simulated maps “reflect the application of Prop 4’s priority-ordered redistricting criteria to Utah’s political geography and thus created a reliable distribution of maps that reflect what would be expected to result from a map-drawing process” designed to adhere to Proposition 4. 
On the other hand, the plaintiffs argue that Trende’s maps don’t minimize county splits “to the greatest extent practicable.” 
“Dr. Trende’s failure to conform his ensembles to Prop 4’s requirements caused his simulated maps to be substantially skewed in favor of Republicans,” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote. “Had he conformed his ensembles to Prop 4’s criteria, their partisan composition would have shifted substantially.”
Gibson is scheduled to begin hearing oral arguments Tuesday at 9 a.m.

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ first candidates for next year’s elections packed the Capitol rotunda on Monday to formally declare their candidacies, kicking off the nine-day filing period and the 2026 election cycle.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, U.S. Rep. French Hill and U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, all Republicans, filed their paperwork with the Secretary of State to run for reelection. Democratic challengers of all three candidates also filed within two hours of the opening of the filing period for partisan candidates at noon.
Hallie Shoffner, a sixth-generation Arkansas farmer running as a Democrat for Cotton’s seat, told reporters her campaign emphasizes “the things that really matter to Arkansans,” such as ensuring people can afford food and health care instead of expecting “workers and families to stretch their paychecks beyond their limits.”
Arkansas has the nation’s highest rate of food insecurity, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report released in September 2024. The USDA has said it will cease issuing the report.
Shoffner noted the ongoing federal government shutdown is likely to worsen this issue, putting federal food assistance funding in jeopardy.

“It’s a political decision, it’s a policy decision [members of Congress] are making not to deal with it, and that’s something I’m going to change,” Shoffner said.
On his campaign site, Cotton said he is “fighting for policies that put Arkansas first and make America strong again.”
Chris Jones, a Democrat who lost to Sanders in the 2022 gubernatorial election, filed to run for Hill’s seat representing Arkansas’ 2nd Congressional District, which includes much of Central Arkansas.
Jones criticized Hill for, in his words, staying silent about the effects of the government shutdown, which is entering its sixth week.
“While SNAP benefits are being cut off, we have the President having a Great Gatsby party for his billionaire friends, and French is saying nothing,” Jones said. “I think that is what really matters, and it’s impacting Arkansas.”
Hill defended his record on the shutdown.
“I voted on Sept. 17 to keep the government open, and the government needs to be open so that we’re not inconveniencing our families, inconveniencing people dependent on federal benefits, our federal agencies here,” Hill said. “So we need the Senate to find five more Senate Democrats to join those Democrats and Republicans in the Senate that have voted consistently some 13 times to reopen the government.”

Executive branch
Sanders, running for her second term in the Governor’s mansion, was the first to file Monday. She said if elected to a second term she planned to “focus on a lot of the same key areas” as she has in her current term.
Those areas include education and public safety, as well as affordability and continuing work to phase out the state income tax. In her current term, Sanders pushed through major legislation overhauling the state’s education system and the parole system, parts of which have been challenged in court.
“The implementation of all of those things has to continue, and I want to see Arkansas continue to move to the top,” Sanders said.
President Donald Trump endorsed Sanders, who was his former press secretary during his first term, in a post on his social media platform Sunday. As of 5 p.m. Monday, no one had filed to run against her in the Republican primary.

State Sen. Fred Love, a Mabelvale Democrat who has reached his term limit in the Legislature, made his candidacy for governor official Monday. He said he has already started traveling across the state to connect with voters.
“Everybody is saying the same thing, and I’m letting them know: Arkansas deserves better, and better is coming,” Love said in an interview.
Love is expected to face Supha Xayprasith-Mays, who also filed Monday, and Gary Huskey in the Democratic primary. Xayprasith-Mays was among the gubernatorial primary candidates Jones defeated in 2022.
Meanwhile, Secretary of State Cole Jester filed to run for Commissioner of State Lands, an office up for grabs since incumbent Commissioner Tommy Land has reached his two-term limit.

“Arkansas’ land is one of our greatest sources of growth, and we have to steward it well,” said Jester, who likely will face two Republican primary opponents.
The 2026 election marks Jester’s first political campaign as a candidate. He is ineligible to run to keep his position as secretary of state because he was appointed, not elected, after John Thurston vacated the office upon winning a special election for state treasurer last year.
Sen. Kim Hammer, R-Benton, is among three Republican candidates who filed Monday to run for secretary of state; Democrat Kelly Grappe also filed to run for the position.
Other sitting officials who filed Monday included longtime lawmakers such as Rep. Mark McElroy, R-Tillar, who is running for a sixth term. He said the first hour of filing Monday had a “circus atmosphere” compared to previous years, with the line to submit paperwork taking longer than it has in the past.
Republican two-term Rep. Jeremy Wooldridge of Marmaduke filed to run for the Senate seat held by Sen. Blake Johnson, R-Corning. Wooldridge is so far the only House member challenging a sitting senator in a primary election.
“I want to serve the people of Northeast Arkansas, and I want to do that in the most effective seat possible,” Wooldridge said.
Open legislative seats
The 2026 primary election is scheduled for March 3 and the general election is Nov. 3. Runoff elections for the general election, if necessary, will be Dec. 1.

Next year’s election calendar also includes two special elections to fill vacancies in Senate District 26 and House District 70. Both are scheduled for a primary election on March 3 and a general election on June 6, but the timing of both has been challenged in court.
The Senate District 26 seat became vacant after the death of Branch Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield on Sept. 2. The House District 70 seat opened up when Rep. Carlton Wing, R-North Little Rock, resigned on Sept. 30 to become the new executive director and CEO of Arkansas PBS.
Republican Bo Renshaw filed to run for the vacant House seat Monday. Democratic party leaders have said they believe they can flip the seat, and two Democrats — Alex Holladay of  North Little Rock and Cordelia Smith-Johnson of Sherwood — filed on Monday. Wing defeated Holiday in 2024.
House District 70 overlaps with Senate District 13, a seat up for grabs since North Little Rock GOP Sen. Jane English has reached her term limit.
Two Republicans plan to run in the primary for English’s seat: two-term Rep. Brandon Achor of Maumelle and former Department of Human Services administrator Mischa Martin of Sherwood.
Martin called herself a “grassroots candidate” in an interview Monday before filing. Achor, who has not yet filed, said he has already made legislative efforts to make health care more affordable and wants to emphasize to voters that he will continue to do so.
Two Democrats are expected to compete for their party’s nomination in Senate District 13: Allison Grigsby Sweatman and Jason Williams. Sweatman unsuccessfully challenged English in 2022.
English, Love and Hammer are among several lawmakers who have reached their term limits, including Rep. Fred Allen, D-Little Rock. Pulaski County Justice of the Peace Steven Person filed to run for Allen’s House seat Monday.

Allen’s wife, Charity Smith-Allen, and Love’s wife, ShaRhonda Love, filed to run for Love’s Senate District 15 seat.
Rep. Tara Shephard, a Little Rock Democrat, filed to run for the same seat and said in an interview that she is the best person for the job because she is the only candidate in the primary with government experience. No Republican has announced or filed candidacy for the seat so far.
With Hammer running for the open Secretary of State position, fellow Benton Republican Randy Sams filed to run for Hammer’s Senate District 16 seat Monday. Sams said he wants to be a “true conservative” lawmaker who will “listen to the voice of the people.”
A statewide issue that’s likely to affect next year’s elections is the ongoing fight to build a 3,000-bed state prison in Franklin County. Sanders has been one of the proposed prison’s biggest supporters; Stubblefield represented part of Franklin County and was a staunch opponent of the plan.
The Senate failed to pass a $750 million prison appropriation bill earlier this year after five attempts, and the matter is expected to be at the forefront of the 2026 fiscal session, which begins in April. Hammer repeatedly voted in favor of funding the prison.
Sams said he has spoken to Franklin County residents even though he is not running to represent them.
“What I’m looking at is, yes, representing the people in District 16, but we also have to look at [the fact] that the vote we give as senators also affects the people of Arkansas,” Sams said.

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Department of Education accepted most of a task force’s recommendations to sustain the state’s financial assistance program for low-income families to access child care.
The department’s announcement came in a letter to providers on Monday, two days after the agency was set to change the School Readiness Assistance program’s reimbursement rate structure.
The state Early Childhood Commission convened the task force of child care experts last month and voted last week to approve the group’s recommendations to make the program sustainable.

OEC letter 
“These updates are not just policy adjustments; they are a continued commitment to strengthen early child care and education in Arkansas, to invest in quality, and to remove barriers for working families,” said Ashelyn Abney, interim director of the department’s Office of Early Childhood, in Monday’s letter.
Child care providers raised the alarm in September that the agency’s plan to change both the reimbursement rates and families’ copayments would make child care unaffordable for families and unsustainable for providers.
Agency officials said the changes were necessary to keep the financial aid program afloat, but providers said increased copayments effective Oct. 1 had already forced parents to remove their children from child care and facilities to close due to lost income.
Additionally, the federal government shut down Oct. 1 and has yet to reopen, blocking access to the bulk of the state’s federal funding that supports the School Readiness Assistance program.
The education department accepted a recommended new reimbursement rate structure that will cost nearly $77 million through Sept. 30, 2026, if it continues that long, according to figures the task force presented last week. The education department had recommended a plan that would cost $70 million over the same period of time.

new SRA rates 
The department accepted three more recommendations:

Eligible families will no longer have a 72-month limit on their access to the School Readiness Assistance program;
Families with multiple children will be charged copayments at the same percentage of their base rate for each child’s age group;
Parents in eligible families must work or attend school a minimum of 30 hours per week, an increase from 20 hours and a reversal of a 2024 policy change.

The department is still considering whether to eliminate copayments for families under 60% of the state median income and set a maximum copayment cap, according to a memo sent to providers Monday.
“This change may increase program costs by $5-7 million, and a phased approach will be considered if funding allows,” the memo states.
Abney’s letter to providers emphasized that the Office of Early Childhood sought to make changes “where there is alignment, feasibility and urgency” and recognized that “not every recommendation can be implemented overnight.”

Michael Baumgartner and Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson both agree the federal government shutdown has gone on too long.
But the two fixtures of Washington state politics insist the other’s party is preventing it from ending. The shutdown hit 34 days on Monday.
Baumgartner thinks he and Ferguson should air their perspectives on the government gridlock in a televised debate.
He issued the challenge last week after a Ferguson post on X blamed suspension of the federal food assistance program ubiquitously known as SNAP on the “Congressional Republicans’ shutdown,” adding that “President Trump needs to tell his party to do their job.”
Baumgartner responded: “Bob, I think you are being dishonest with the people of Washington state. Let’s you and I do a televised debate on it and they can decide for themselves. Sound good?”
The first-term congressman, one of only two Washington Republicans in Congress, told reporters Sunday that he has not heard back from the governor.
On Monday, a Ferguson spokesperson did not reply to the Washington State Standard’s requests for comment.
Though many will brush off the debate offer as a political stunt, Baumgartner contends it would have civic value.
“To some extent, he is the most prominent Democrat, and to some extent I’m the most prominent Republican in our state, so it would be good for us to have a public conversation,” said the Spokane resident and former state lawmaker.
“Hopefully, he will take me up on the offer,” he said. To entice Ferguson, he offered to hold the event on the governor’s home turf. “We can even do it in Seattle,” he said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/michael-baumgartner-scaled-e1762218285505-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-03 20:16:56.908509

Under the new rule, released Oct. 31, nonprofits that are considered to have a “substantial illegal purpose” could have their employees disqualified from what’s known as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. The activities listed in the rule include “aiding and abetting violations of Federal immigration laws” and supplying children with puberty blockers or hormones for the purpose of transgender care.
The federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, created in 2007, releases people who work for 10 years at a nonprofit or in government from their student loan obligations after they’ve made 120 monthly payments toward their borrowed amount. Eligible professions include public school teachers, social workers, emergency management workers, health care workers, employees at nonprofits and government workers. 
U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, said at a press conference in Hartford Monday that the program was created in a bipartisan effort to attract talented people to jobs that benefit the public but don’t pay a lot.  
 ”People understood that when you have talented people in college coming out of school … public service might not be the most lucrative in terms of trying to deal with student loan debt,” Courtney said. 
Data from the U.S. Department of Education cited by the attorney general’s office showed that, as of July 2025, nearly 12,000 Connecticut residents have had loans forgiven through the program, and an additional 12,500 were still enrolled. 
In a March executive order, President Donald J. Trump said that “instead of alleviating worker shortages in necessary occupations, the PSLF Program has misdirected tax dollars into activist organizations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and American values, sometimes through criminal means.”  
Attorney General William Tong said at Monday’s press conference that he believed it wasn’t at all clear who could be disqualified from loan forgiveness under the rule, since the meaning of “substantial illegal purpose” was vague. 
Tong said be believes the Trump administration has a tendency to “move the goalposts” and could create “reasons that don’t make any sense” to deny eligibility to public servants. “Everybody has a target on their backs,” he said. 
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, also highlights the phrase “substantial illegal purpose,” calling it vague, and alleges that the Trump administration has no authority to limit eligibility for a program that was created by Congress. 
“The only forms of ‘illegality’ named are a cherry-picked list of this Administration’s most disfavored groups and activities, including support for immigrants, gender-affirming care, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and public protest,” the lawsuit reads. “The department seeks to chill the activity of public service employers by discouraging their employees from what it deems objectionable forms of public service.” 
Union leaders, Democratic politicians and government officials at the Monday event expressed concern the new rule might discourage people from pursuing public service. 
Cara Delaney, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Connecticut health center, said she may not have been able to provide care in vulnerable communities without the prospect of student loan forgiveness. She has almost completed the 10 years necessary for her loans to be forgiven, she said, and she plans to continue her work in public service. 
“We take care of all patients that come through the door,” Delaney told the Connecticut Mirror. “We see them in the emergency room. We see them in the clinic. We see people who are gender diverse. We see people with all types of immigration status.” 
“There is definitely a fear,” she added. “The rule … is really ambiguous, and so we don’t really know where things are going to fall.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9556-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-03 20:00:53.399766
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-04 00:45:00+00:00,CT Mirror,UI asks regulators to take another look at proposed power line,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/03/ui-fairfield-congress-railroad-transmission-line-reconsider/,"UI doesn't expect the Siting Council to change its mind, but it's a necessary step before filing a lawsuit seeking to overturn the decision.","United Illuminating asked state regulators on Monday to revisit their decision that blocked the utility from building an above-ground transmission line through sections of Fairfield and Bridgeport.
The project — formally known as the Fairfield-Congress Railroad Transmission Line — has generated intense local pushback over the impact that the transmission line would have as it passes over homes, businesses and churches, suspended from giant steel monopoles. Utility officials have countered that the proposed alternatives, including burying the line underground, would add hundreds of millions of dollars to the project’s costs, which would be paid back by customers across Connecticut.
Last month, the Connecticut Siting Council voted 5-3 to reject the project, with several members reversing their previous positions of support. 
“As the Council has repeatedly found, there is a strong public need for this Project, which will replace 60-year-old, deteriorated UI transmission infrastructure, which sits atop 100-year-old, [state] owned railroad catenaries,” the company said in a formal petition asking the Siting Council to reconsider its ruling. 
Additionally, the petition argued that the council’s sudden reversal left company officials “with no guidance as to what, if any, issues the Council had with the proposed solution to the important public need the Project sought to address.”
While the request is unlikely to yield a different outcome, it is necessary for United Illuminating to exhaust its options before the Siting Council in order to file a lawsuit seeking to overturn the decision.
The company gave further indication that it is pursing a legal appeal last month when its attorneys sent letters to members of the Siting Council, as well as local leaders in Bridgeport and Fairfield, advising them to preserve any documents or communications related to the project. 
The letter, known as a “litigation hold,” often serves as a precursor to a formal lawsuit.
Officials in Fairfield and Bridgeport did not immediately offer comment Monday on UI’s latest request. A spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont’s office declined to comment.
The Fairfield-Congress transmission line was previously the subject of a lawsuit brought by officials in Bridgeport and Fairfield, along with other local critics, challenging the Siting Council’s decision to propose and approve an alternative plan that moved the proposed route of the transmission line from the south side of the Metro North railroad tracks to the north.
In April, a judge ruled that the council has overstepped its authority by modifying UI’s proposal with its own route.
The decision led the Siting Council to reconsider the original 7.3 mile route as proposed by UI in 2023. Over the next few months, the members of the council publicly wavered over their decision, holding a series of votes in which they went back and forth over whether to approve the project.
After a nonbinding straw vote was held in September in which a majority of the council indicated their support for the project, opponents declared the process “tainted” as a result of several members switching their positions from an earlier vote in June.
Those concerns evaporated, however, after the council switched positions again to reject UI’s proposal during the final and biding vote held on Oct. 16.
Instead, it is now the utility that is protesting the process. In its filing on Monday, the company stated that the Siting Council “acted illegally and arbitrarily in flipping its vote with absolutely no reasons provided.” 
The transmission line is also of interest to communities outside of Bridgeport and Fairfield due to the construction costs that will be recouped from utility customers. 
UI has estimated that the cost of building its proposed overhead transmission line will be around $300 million. That amount can be spread among the nearly 14 million electric customers in six states under rules established by the regional grid operator, ISO New England.
If the Siting Council forces those lines to be buried, however, the additional costs are borne by electric customers in Connecticut alone, according to ISO NE. 
Burying the line could increase the costs of the project by up to $500 million, according to UI’s estimates. Critics, however, argue that the utility’s estimates are wildly inflated based on the costs of other recently completed underground transmission lines in the area.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_6500-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-03 20:00:53.399766

Voters can find their precinct polling locations using the Iowa Secretary of State’s website. Polling locations are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday.
Who can vote in Iowa?
In order to participate in Iowa elections, people must register to vote. A qualified voter in Iowa must be:

An Iowa resident.
A U.S. citizen.
18 years old by Election Day.

There are also restrictions on voting for certain individuals in Iowa. Voters cannot be:

A convicted felon, unless their voting rights have been restored.
Judged mentally incompetent to vote by a court.
Claiming the right to vote in any other place.

A person who is eligible to vote but is not yet a registered voter has the option to register on Election Day at their precinct voting location. In order to register, a qualified voter must provide proof of identity using ID like an Iowa driver’s license, non-operator’s ID or U.S. passport, as well as proof of residence using documents like a residential lease, paycheck or utility bill listing their current address.
Check your voter registration status online here.
I’m registered to vote. What do I need to bring to the polls?
Voters who are already registered to vote still need to bring a form of identification with them to their polling place in order to participate. Accepted forms of identification include:

Iowa driver’s license
Iowa non-operator ID
Out-of-state driver’s license or non-operator ID
U.S. passport
U.S. military or veteran ID
ID card issued by employer
Student ID issued by Iowa high school or college
Tribal ID card/document

If a person does not have a valid ID when they go to vote, they are still allowed to cast a ballot if another registered voter at the precinct attests for their identity. Voters can also bring Election Day registration documents to confirm their identity.
People who do not have accepted IDs or a person willing to attest for them can cast a provisional ballot. People who cast provisional ballots will have their voter registration record and related evidence reviewed by the absentee and special voters’ precinct board.
I have an absentee ballot that I haven’t returned. What should I do?
Iowans who have sent in their absentee ballots can track the ballot’s status on the Secretary of State’s website. But for people who have not yet returned their ballot, there’s still time to participate in this year’s election.
Absentee ballots can be returned to a voter’s local county auditor’s office by 8 p.m. on Election Day to be valid. These ballots cannot be delivered to precinct polling locations on Election Day.
If a voter cannot go themselves to return the ballot, Iowa has some restrictions on who can return it in their stead — voters can designate another person to return their absentee ballot if they are an immediate family member or member of the household. Voters with disabilities can also designate someone outside of these categories to return their ballot.
There are also options available for people who have requested — but not returned — absentee ballots to vote in person on Election Day. Voters can cast regular ballots if they bring in their absentee ballot to the precinct polling place and surrender it. If a person requested an absentee ballot but cannot return it, they are allowed to cast a provisional ballot.

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator via SouthWings)An environmental group has filed a federal lawsuit against a River Parishes alumina refinery that state regulators have repeatedly cited for allowing toxic pollution to escape into public drainage areas and waterways.
The Louisiana Environmental Action Network filed suit Friday against Atalco Gramercy LLC in the federal court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The company operates the Atlantic Alumina facility that straddles the border of St. James and St. John the Baptist parishes on the west bank of the Mississippi River. 
The 17-page pleading is based largely on pollution discharges state inspectors discovered during a series of visits to the facility beginning last year. The Illuminator detailed the extent of the pollution and its impact in a series of reports this year. The reports shed light on the high concentrations of toxic metals found in water and soil samples collected from the polluted areas. Much of the information was unknown to neighboring residents and local leaders. 
The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality has cited the facility for dozens of violations stemming from breaches in the levees surrounding the facility’s “red mud” waste containment lakes and numerous wastewater discharges into the river that exceeded permitted limits. 
Atalco did not respond Monday to a request for comment.
The lawsuit cites many of the regulatory violations in a 606-page inspection report the Department of Environmental Quality began in September 2024 and completed in March. It also includes violations LDEQ inspectors discovered in subsequent visits to the facility in May and June. 
Runoff from Atalco alumina refinery into Mississippi River raises environmental concerns

“In the aggregate, this litany of violations demonstrates that Defendant’s lack of care for the proper operation of the Facility has been reckless and with egregious disregard for the environmental and human impacts of its mismanagement,” the lawsuit states.
The Louisiana Environmental Action Network is asking the federal court to award an unspecified amount in civil penalties and legal fees and to declare Atalco’s unpermitted actions as violations of the Clean Water Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The group is also asking for an injunction to prevent further violations and require Atalco to install appropriate treatment technology at the facility.
Atalco refines bauxite, a rust-colored rock containing raw metals, at the refinery into alumina, turning it into an ultra-fine white powder. Atalco sells the alumina to metal smelters that need it to make finished aluminum. 
Opened in 1958 as Kaiser Aluminum, the Gramercy facility is the only remaining bauxite refinery in the United States, making itthe nation’s only domestic source of a critical metal feedstock. 
For every ton of aluminum produced from Atalco’s work, bauxite refining generates an estimated 2.5 tons of waste byproduct, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Atalco stores the waste, most of which takes the form of a thick red mud containing highly corrosive and toxic chemicals, in large containment ponds surrounded by 50-feet-high levees. 
In August 2024, federal inspectors discovered breaches in some of Atalco’s levees in which the toxic slurry formed erosion channels and flowed offsite into public areas. State inspectors then discovered several more levee breaches in the subsequent months. Atalco made repairs to its levees but inspectors found new erosion channels during a follow-up visit in May.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Most farmers in Iowa are finished with corn and soybean harvest or have just a handful of acres left in the field, according to average harvest rates. 
Exact data is not available due to the ongoing government shutdown, which paused crop progress and condition reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
At this point in the season last year, corn harvest was 92% which was nearly a week ahead of the 2023 harvest and two weeks ahead of the five-year average. Soybeans were 98% complete this time last year. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said farmers have typically harvested 96% of soybean acres and 85% of corn acres by the first week of November. 
Naig said in the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship’s weekly weather report that wet weather may have kept some farmers out of the field over the past week. 
Conditions were especially wet in western parts of the state, according to State Climatologist Justin Glisan, who reported some western communities received more than 1.5 inches of rain.
Overall, Glisan said the statewide weekly average precipitation was 0.7 inch, which is about two-tenths of an inch above the average. Temperatures across the state, on average, were also slightly above the climatological normal at 45.3 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Craig Sweet, a farmer near St. Charles, said his corn and soybeans are “pretty good this year.” 
“Not complaining anyway, it has been worse,” Sweet said. “It’s just like everything – you’ve kind of got to go with the flow.”
Sweet said Friday he had a little more than 30 acres to harvest and hoped to get it finished in the next week. He said after that, he has some fall tilling to do “and that’ll be it.” 
Time to test soil for pests
As farmers take to other field work at the end of harvest season, Iowa State University Extension and Outreach said it is the “best time” to collect soil samples and test for soybean cyst nematodes, a parasitic roundworm. 
Soybean cyst nematodes limit the soybean plant’s ability to absorb nutrients from the soil and can also make symptoms worse when the plant is affected by other diseases or pests. 
Soybean cyst nematodes have been detected in every Iowa county. Soil samples can be sent to the ISU Plant and Insect Diagnostic Clinic, so farmers can determine if they need to plant soybean cyst nematode resistant varieties next year.
Soil temperatures have also dropped below 50 degrees, according to the Iowa Environmental Mesonet. ISU agronomists recommend farmers wait for soil temperatures to be in this range before applying nitrogen to their fields.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — State officials voted Monday to send Oklahoma food banks $1 million a week if federal food assistance programs continue to lack funding during the government shutdown. 
The Contingency Review Board, whose voting members include Gov. Kevin Stitt, Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, and House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, unanimously approved the plan. The funding is approved for up to seven weeks, drawing from a state emergency fund that has a $7.8 million balance. The expenditure is contingent on a continued lack of federal funding.
Funds will be administered to Oklahoma food banks through the state Department of Human Services. Two-thirds will be sent to the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma, which serves 53 counties in western and central Oklahoma, and the rest will go to the Eastern Food Bank of Oklahoma, which serves the rest of the state.
The funding will only be distributed if money provided the previous week has been expended and it can only serve SNAP recipients. 
The panel also approved a $72,000 appropriation to upgrade software systems to allow state funds to be deposited onto SNAP recipients’ EBT cards. Officials said they want the ability to do this if it’s needed in the future.  
The panel’s vote comes as the Trump administration said Monday that it would partially fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides benefits to 42 million Americans using a $4.65 billion contingency fund. The administration warned though that it could take months for the benefits to reach recipients, which include over 680,000 Oklahomans.
Two federal judges ordered Friday that the Trump administration must continue administering the program, also known as food stamps amid the ongoing federal government shutdown, which has entered its second month. 
Stitt said state officials will continue to “monitor” when the state’s savings account might be used. If the shutdown persists until Dec. 1, more federal programs like Medicaid, child care and the military will be affected, he said. 
“Over the next couple of weeks, I think it’ll be clear if we need to do something like that,” Stitt said. “… You saw the Trump administration released today that 50% of the money would be to fund, which we still are waiting on guidance. We don’t know if that’s just going to be added to a card. We don’t know if it’s going to be prioritized to certain individuals. We just don’t know yet.” 
Stitt, Hilbert and Paxton all again called on Congress to end the shutdown. 
Following Monday’s vote, Oklahoma Democrats said this action wasn’t enough and doubled down on their call for a special session to tap into the state’s savings, which has about $1.3 billion. State law limits its use and how much can be spent from the fund. 
The Oklahoma Department of Human Services, which administers SNAP, did not answer questions Monday afternoon about how long it would take for funding to be restored and what the average cut would likely be to Oklahomans.
“At this time, Oklahoma Human Services is awaiting updated guidance from our federal partners at USDA,” the agency said in a statement in response. “While we await further instruction, we remain focused on doing everything we can to preserve critical services and supports for Oklahomans who rely on them.”
The state leaders have also called on Oklahomans, nonprofits and food banks to step in to fill the gap in services while the federal government is shut down.
It will cost the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma and the Eastern Food Bank of Oklahoma $5.5 million each per month to double their efforts, which officials said will not be enough as the groups only provide one meal for every nine that SNAP does. 
The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 because Congress has failed to find a bipartisan path forward on a stopgap spending bill by the start of the federal fiscal year. A Republican proposal seeks to temporarily keep the government open through Nov. 21. Democrats back a separate plan to permanently restore health subsidies for those who buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)TOPEKA — It’s unclear how a federal judge’s order forcing the U.S. Department of Agriculture to release food program funds by Wednesday will affect Kansas recipients, state leaders said.
U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell Jr. told the USDA and Secretary Brooke Rollins, both named in the lawsuit filed by the Rhode Island Council of Churches and other nonprofits, that the state had to release funding for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients.
The funding stopped with the program’s November payment because of the federal government shutdown.
McConnell gave the USDA two options — a partial payment made from the SNAP contingency fund or a full payment that would pull from child nutrition program funds. In a Monday filing, the government elected to send out a partial payment that will send half of the funds to SNAP recipients.
The filing directed the USDA to send states a notice regarding how much each SNAP household should receive. McConnell also said the payment should go out by Wednesday.
“Right now, the Kansas Department for Children and Families has not received this information,” DCF said in a statement Monday. “Once it does, DCF will determine next steps to issue the partial payments and communicate when Kansas SNAP recipients can expect to receive them.”
DCF urged people using SNAP to follow a website created for updates on its main page at dcf.ks.gov.
Haley Kottler, campaign director for food access at Kansas Appleseed, said the partial payment will not be enough to help the 180,000-plus Kansans who put food on their table with SNAP funding.
“Fifty percent of people’s benefits is not going to make ends meet for families,” she said. “We know that 100% of benefits don’t always make ends meet for families, and so we are very worried.”
Kottler said the average SNAP participant receives a little over $185 a month, which breaks down to about $6 a day for food. If only half is received in November, that’s $3 a day for food, which isn’t adequate, she said.
Kottler also said that even if the federal government is able to distribute half the funds to each state by Wednesday, it will be at least 72 hours before the funds can be processed and put onto the debit cards that SNAP recipients use.
What’s happening is “absolutely not a resolution” to the situation, Kottler said. 
“We know that the only resolution that will actually help families on SNAP is the full benefit amount,” she said. “Fifty percent in the holiday season is not going to cut it.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/veg-cans-1024x7681758839896-1.jpg,,,2025-11-03 19:16:32.002176

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)A team at Iowa State University has developed a tool to help residents living in homes with no air conditioning to stay safe during extreme heat.
If fully launched, residents could have an app on their phones to accurately predict indoor temperature compared to outside, warn them if conditions are getting dangerous and point them toward help, either through a cooling center or a network of friends and family.
An interdisciplinary team of faculty, undergraduate and graduate students used data gathered over nearly a decade to create CommHEAT, a prototype mobile app. It began as a project to catalog tree cover, building materials and more to help focus City of Des Moines’ efforts in urban sustainability.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Ulrike Passe, an ISU architecture professor and director of the Center for Building Energy Research, brought together and led the team responsible for CommHEAT. Participating Des Moines residents tested it this summer. The team is currently analyzing the data and feedback received from residents, Passe said, wrapping up the three-year project that was funded with a $1.2 million grant from the National Science Foundation.
“I personally want to take the team back and write another proposal to say here, this is what we learned, now we’ve got to find funding which can actually take the research to practice,” Passe said.
‘The team that Ulrike built’
While the project that sparked the CommHEAT app began in 2023, Passe said research into Des Moines neighborhoods and how their environments impact the lives of its citizens began nearly a decade ago with seed funding from ISU and a partnership with the City of Des Moines.
Jan Thompson, ISU professor of natural resource ecology and management, said the team initially got more than $400,000 in seed funding through an initiative for interdisciplinary research, championed by the university’s then-president Steven Leath.
Funding went to “Big Data for Sustainable City Decision-Making,” a project in partnership with Des Moines in which researchers — both student and faculty — collected information on neighborhoods and their residents, from the tree canopy and landscape to the sizes, types and placement of buildings and how people interact with them.
From there,  the research branched out, Passe said. In 2017, the Polk County Health Department reached out with concerns they were hearing from inner-city residents about too-warm temperatures in their homes, many of which had no central air conditioning. More than half of the homes in some Des Moines neighborhoods have no air conditioning, Passe said.
Passe said she explained at the time that if there is no internal temperature set in a building, the materials and fabrics that make it up will start to warm up at different rates depending on a variety of outdoor variables, like trees, parking lots and more. The team also provided sensors for the county to give to residents, and when the data came back, they saw the source of concern.
“We actually noticed that there was really a big difference in the homes they had selected,” Passe said.
From there, Passe said the team started writing research proposals, hoping to further study impacts on indoor temperature and bring together all of the data they’ve compiled, as well as resources on weather and other factors, into a system that could help make urban areas cooler and safer.
A lot of expertise in a range of fields was needed for the work, Thompson said, but Passe was able to build a group to help in all areas of research and application. Across their initial project, this newest one and others connected to it, Thompson said as many as 20 faculty members have been involved in addition to a number of graduate and undergraduate students.
“I always refer to it as the team that Ulrike built, because she really did,” Thompson said. “She was just on her phone, she was calling people saying, ‘I think I need a person who can do this. I think I need a person who can do that.’”
Putting prototype to practice
The first two summers of the National Science Foundation-funded project were spent further connecting with the communities they planned to study, ISU doctoral student and research team member Tian Yao said, and working with study participants to learn their habits during heatwaves.
ISU industrial and manufacturing systems engineering professor Michael Dorneich said each summer, research participants with sensors in their homes were sent “quick capture” surveys during heat events to determine their feelings, habits and their perception of how the heat impacted them. The team defined as “heat events” periods of at least three consecutive days with heat indexes measuring over 100 degrees, according to an ISU new release.
Once a summer’s worth of data was collected and stored in a server made by the ISU Virtual Reality Application Center, other members of the research team dove into all of the factors other than outside temperature and lack of air conditioning that can impact internal heat.
Kimia Sharifi, an ISU student pursuing a master’s degree in architecture, said she and other team members used the information to create 3D models of the houses and put in place outdoor conditions that would provide an accurate assessment of how much sunlight was hitting the house and other factors.
They also ran different thermal simulations to see how weather impacted the models, Sharifi said, which at one point brought one home model’s internal temperature to above 90 degrees.
Dorneich said that with all of the information and technology the team had at that point, they could predict the inside temperature of a home “with some degree of accuracy.”
“If we can do that, then how do we use that information?” Dorneich said. “So that’s where we come in.”
Included in the app were indicators of outdoor and approximate indoor temperature and a 12-hour forecast, as well as warnings for when it was getting dangerously hot inside. CommHEAT also has a list of nearby cooling centers for those needing to get out of the house and a community page where people could invite others to join the app and view each other’s home temperatures in case of an emergency.
Residents explored several iterations of the app in its development, Yao said, and were prompted over the summer to check it during heat events. She is currently conducting interviews with the participants on their usage, but said she’s already heard positive things and suggestions for how to make it better.
“People feel that somehow it changed their behavior, or at least increased their awareness of the danger of the heat,” Yao said.
One person said getting reminders to check the app made them realize they needed to take a break from work due to the heat, Yao said, and others began to internalize habits for feeling better when it’s warm, like wearing loose-fitting clothing or using ice packs to cool down.
While the app is no longer online, Passe said she’d like to be able to continue improving it by adding notification capabilities and other resources. The network page of the app was also limited in its use, Yao said, as only people with no air conditioning were able to download it and users said many people in their support networks do have air conditioning, so they weren’t able to connect with anyone.
As weather grows warmer and people become more in danger of succumbing to the heat, Passe said it would be easy for people to say the solution is to just give everyone an air conditioner, but that would come with its own financial and environmental problems.
Looking ahead, Passe said she wants to finish analysis for the National Science Foundation work and keep development of the CommHEAT tool going to the point where it could eventually be available for public download.
“I want everybody who doesn’t have an air conditioner to have that app on their phone,” Passe said.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-04 00:06:49+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,SJC considers whether charter schools must obey public records laws,Jennifer Smith,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/courts/sjc-considers-whether-charter-schools-must-obey-public-records-laws/,"The Mystic Valley Regional Charter School, in rebuffing at least 10 public records requests for information on various aspects of its operations, insists that it is not covered by the sweeping statute guaranteeing public access to the records of government entities.","FOR DECADES, MASSACHUSETTS charter schools have had a single rallying cry when under fire from teachers unions and advocacy groups that say they draw resources that could otherwise go to public schools: Charter schools, they say, are public schools.  
Introduced through the state’s 1993 Education Reform Act, charter schools operate independently of traditional public school districts, but are publicly funded and open to all students – a point charter leaders often make. 
All of which made the argument a Malden charter school brought to the Supreme Judicial Court on Monday a striking departure from years of effort by charters to be treated the same as their district school counterparts.  
The Mystic Valley Regional Charter School, in rebuffing at least 10 public records requests for information on various aspects of its operations, insists that it is not covered by the sweeping statute guaranteeing public access to the records of government entities.  
In court filings in the case, Mystic Valley said that, unlike district-run schools, “as a Commonwealth charter school, it does not fall under the category of entities handling public documents” and is not subject to the state public records law. 
While charter schools do have to track and provide vast reams of data to the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, Mystic Valley argues it has no obligation to provide that same information to members of the public. Charter schools, in their view, are public schools that are structured and treated in some ways more like corporations. 
Justices did not seem convinced by that argument. By almost every measure, they noted, charter schools are treated like ordinary public schools. And public schools must abide by the public records law. 
“You’re in real trouble,” Justice Scott Kafker told Mystic Valley attorney Charles Waters, invoking a time-honored test of reasoning to the question at hand. “It quacks like a duck, it waddles like a duck, it paddles like a duck.”  
Mystic Valley, a K-12 school that boasts high achievement scores among its 1,700 students, has long been an outlier among the state’s roughly 80 charter schools. While U.S. News and World Report this fall ranked it the sixth best high school in the state, it has faced criticism over allegations of pervasive racial bias.  
Officials including then-attorney general Maura Healey have taken aim at Mystic Valley policies that they say discriminated against minority students, including a hairstyle rule that disciplined students for wearing “drastic or unnatural hairstyles,” which included common styles worn by Black women like box braids. The school only relented after Healey got involved. The Legislature later passed the CROWN Act banning rules that discriminate based on natural hairstyles.  
Mystic Valley is one of only three charter schools that are not members of the Massachusetts Charter Public School Association, a statewide advocacy organization.
The association, in a statement after Monday’s SJC arguments, said it “fundamentally disagrees” with Mystic Valley’s claims about the nature of charter schools. 
“As public entities, the law requires that charter public schools operate in a manner that embraces and upholds transparency and accountability – not only to the state, but also to students, families, and local communities,” said Tim Nicolette, executive director of the charter school association. “For that reason, responding to public records requests in accordance with the law is a requirement of all public schools, including charter public schools.” 
Mystic Valley received at least 10 public records requests between January and November 2022 from the Malden News Network, Commonwealth Transparency, and mayoral candidate Lissette Alvarado. They requested information including corporate statements, contracts, ledgers, lease records, conflict of interest disclosures filed by board members, payments made to employees or professional services, and confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements.  
The school refused on the grounds that charter schools do not have to obey public records law.  
According to the secretary of state’s office,  which oversees the public records law, “every government record in Massachusetts is presumed to be public unless it may be withheld under a specifically stated exemption.” 
Charter schools are not exempted as a category, but Mystic Valley argues that its documents do not actually count as government records. If the public wants its records, Mystic Valley’s attorney told the court, the public should go to the state and ask for them. 
After the supervisor of records in the secretary of state’s office issued multiple orders for the school to comply with the record requests, Attorney General Andrea Campbell’s office filed suit in Suffolk Superior Court in July 2023 to force Mystic Valley to produce the records. The Superior Court sided with the AG’s office, declaring the school to be a government entity subject to the public records law. Mystic Valley appealed, and the SJC decided to take up the question, which has never before come before the court. 
Because the statute controlling charter schools created a “significant obligation” to keep, collect, maintain, and report “massive amounts” of information to state educational agencies, said Waters, the Mystic Valley attorney, that must mean the Legislature only expected that sort of information sharing. 
Lawmakers likely “didn’t want to then additionally burden charter schools, that already have this burden, with the burden of having to set up a structure for fielding public records requests,” he said. There is no carve-out for charters to comply with public records requests like there is for making sure they follow conflict of interest laws, he noted. 
Justices were openly skeptical. There seemed to be no conflict, based on their questions, between operating as a unique type of public school and being responsive to public records requests. 
“I understand charter schools were created to be independent in certain ways, to foster innovation in education and have the ability to do that in a way that the average public school does not,” Justice Dalila Wendlandt told Waters. “Good. But that doesn’t carry you to the argument that they’re not subject to the public record law.”  
The one thing that cut in Mystic Valley’s favor, the justices said, might be that charter schools are not specifically included in the public records statute as a type of agency, authority, or department covered by public records laws.  
Other cases around public records requests are more straightforward, like the MBTA clearly being a government authority, Kafker noted.  
Prior courts considering whether a state entity had to cooperate with public records laws barely even dwelled on whether the entity was covered, he noted, because it was so clear. They instead just moved to a five-factor test about how the entity was created, whether it performs some essentially governmental function, whether it receives or expends public funds, the involvement of private interests, and the extent to which it is controlled and supervised by other government authorities.  
Assistant Attorney General Kerry Kilcoyne said the court does not need to jump through definitional hoops. If Mystic Valley is a public school, which no one disputes, then the court can rely on previous case law where it specifically stated that records of public schools qualify as public records, she said.  
What’s more, many of these agency or political subdivision terms are used loosely, Kilcoyne said. It may be enough, she said, that charter schools are directed by the state to serve the government function of servicing the Commonwealth’s students in a public educational institution. 
“I concede that you win easily on the five-factor test,” Kafker told Kilcoyne. “I’m just trying to figure out if I have to get you into a category before you do that.” 
For its part, the state charter school association, which has led the fight to have charter schools regarded as simply another public school choice for families, made clear where it hopes the court lands.   
“We hope the Supreme Judicial Court affirms that charter public schools, as public schools, must adhere to the laws that govern government entities,” said Nicolette, the association’s executive director, “and as such must respond to public records requests, ensuring a critical means of ensuring transparency, accountability, and the maintenance of public trust.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pembertonjohnadamscourthouse2-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C647&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-03 19:16:32.002176

Quagga mussels are an invasive, nonnative species that Department of Agriculture officials first detected in microscopic larvae form called veligers in the Snake River in 2023. Since the initial detection, officials also detected quagga mussels in water samples taken in September 2024 and again this September. 
Because the mussels are capable of reproducing rapidly and clogging pipes used for irrigation and drinking water,  Department of Agriculture officials, contractors and other state officials have adopted a total eradication strategy and administered a copper-based chemical called Natrix in the Snake River in an attempt to kill all of the mussels. 
Once they reach adult stage, state officials said one pair of quagga mussels is capable of producing as many as 1 million offspring per year.

This fall, crews administered the copper-based chemical across a 3.5 mile section of the Snake River near Shoshone Falls from Sept. 30 to Oct. 14.
“No, we’re not finding any viable mussels,” Tewalt told the Idaho Capital Sun after briefing the Idaho Legislature’s Natural Resources Interim Committee meeting Monday. “And as you see in the chart too, after 48 hours of active treatment, we could find no viable veligers, which is important. That’s what we would expect to have happen.”
During Tewalt’s briefing at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise, she told legislators that the September 2023 detection of quagga mussels in the Snake River near Twin Falls was the first-ever detection of quagga mussels in the entire Columbia River basin system. The Snake River is the longest river in Idaho, a source of drinking water and irrigation and a major tributary of the Columbia River. Because the river system is an important source of drinking water, irrigation and hydroelectricity, Tewalt said state officials moved quickly and with a sense of purpose.  
“It goes without saying that quagga mussels … are the single-biggest invasive species threat to our aquatic system,” Tewalt told legislators Monday.
 Copper chemical used to kill invasive mussels also kills fish

One of the consequences of administering the copper-based chemical to the Snake River is that it also suffocates and kills fish in the river. In 2023, thousands of fish died and floated to the surface of the Snake River in such quantities that state staffers took to the river with boats and nets to remove tons of dead fish, the Sun previously reported. 
This year, Tewalt told legislators that there was “minimal fish mortality,” perhaps in part due to the fact that fish in that section of the river that were vulnerable to the copper chemical had already been killed and not restocked. 
“Before we got started, we indicated to the public that this treatment would kill all of the fish in the infected parts of the Snake River,” Tewalt told legislators. “That is a high and heartbreaking cost, but it is what we had to do to try to save the entire river.”
On top of administering the copper chemical, state officials also increased water sampling, increased the number of watercraft inspection stations and decontamination hot washes and conducted public outreach campaigns, Tewalt said. 
 What does the quagga mussel eradication program look like?

This fall about 25 Idaho State Department of Agriculture staffers and another 25 or 30 contractors were based on the Snake River near Twin Falls for nearly 24 hours a day from Sept. 30 to Oct. 14. Nearby in Twin Falls, laboratory technicians analysed fresh water samples to ensure the concentration of the copper chemical was administered in the planned one-part-per-million ratio and to monitor for quagga mussel veligers. 
New this year, crews focused on hard-to-reach sections of the Snake River, including deep pools and sections of the river that created unique laminar flow challenges that had previously made administering the chemical in certain stretches unique. 
This fall the department relied on certified scuba divers. One state employee who is a scuba diver, Southern Chief Treatment Engineer Jeremey Varley, even designed and rigged a custom underwater manifold system to better administer the copper chemical in hard-to-reach stretches of the river. 
Tewalt is encouraged by the treatment program, but does not yet know if the effort succeeded in eradicating all of the quagga mussels. 
Before the most recent treatment began, the September water samples showed that the infested portion of the Snake River was about half the size as it was the previous year. 
Once treatment began, water samples showed non-viable quaggal mussel larvae in about 48 hours and crews have not found any viable mussel larvae since then.

Tewalt also has more confidence in the availability of water samples and sampling results, since the water samples are now efficiently analyzed at a nearby lab in Twin Falls instead of sent out-of-state for testing, as before. 
However, once water temperatures drop due to colder weather, Tewalt said the mussels will stop reproducing again until the weather warms again next summer or fall. That means officials may not know exactly how effective this year’s treatment was until next summer and fall’s water samples are analyzed. 
In the meantime, Tewalt said inspection and decontamination stations will continue to be increased, water sampling will continue and the Idaho State Department of Agriculture will do its best to limit the impact on people who enjoy recreating on the river. 
“So, more stations, even more of a focus on inspections, communications and sampling,” Tewalt told the Sun on Monday.

When the doors opened at 10 a.m., the people walked into a waiting room and lined up in front of a receptionist’s desk. One young woman with a curious baby slung over her shoulder pulled out her phone and asked Google how to say ropa – clothes – in English.
When she was at the front of the line, the young woman showed her phone to the receptionist.
“Just ropa, no comida?” the receptionist asked – “just clothes, no food?”
On Friday, a pair of federal judges ruled that the Trump administration’s plans to pause the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program starting in November were illegal. SNAP helps feed tens of millions of Americans, including 1.4 million Georgians.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has agreed to pay a portion of November’s benefits to recipients as the government shutdown continues into its second month, but it’s not clear how soon the funds could reach the accounts of SNAP recipients in Georgia. A spokesperson for the  state’s Department of Human Services, which is responsible for dispersing federal SNAP funds to Georgia residents, said Monday that the department is monitoring the situation closely, but did not offer a timeline for when November SNAP funds would become available for recipients.
“We will continue to follow official guidance from USDA as it becomes available,” DHS communications director Ellen Brown said in a statement. “We understand how important SNAP benefits are to Georgia families.”
The governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment Monday. Gov. Brian Kemp has so far resisted calls to use state funds to keep food assistance flowing during the shutdown.

In the meantime, organizations like MUST Ministries are trying to hold off hunger for families in need. 
MUST’s food pantries have been under strain in a way that they haven’t since the shutdowns and layoffs of the early pandemic, said Maurice Speaks, director of the ministries’ Cherokee County service center. 
“I would mirror it to COVID in March of 2020, when that hit,” he said. “The fear, the not knowing where you were going to get your next meal from, if the food was there, just the fear alone.”
It’s not just food people are needing, Speaks said. Parents sacrifice to feed their kids, and that means they often need help with things like clothes, gas or health care.
Speaks said churches, businesses and members of the community have pitched in to make sure they haven’t had to turn anyone away during the current crisis, and he’s hopeful that will remain the case until the situation is resolved, whenever that may be.
“That’s my prayer,” he said. “That’s what I believe when I open this building every morning, that we will have enough to service every family that comes through that door, and then when we need to rejuvenate what we’ve lost or we don’t have anymore, that God sends it.”
Other organizations, such as the Goodr Community Market on Edgewood, are also facing increased strain as federal SNAP funding hangs in the balance.

The community grocery store, which opened its doors in July, aims to serve low-income families and senior citizens in downtown Atlanta’s Sweet Auburn neighborhood. The store provides an accessible option for groceries for nearby residents without reliable transportation. 
“Before we were here, [residents] had a 36 minute walk,” Goodr founder and CEO Jasmine Crowe-Houston said. “Now, on average they have a three to five minute walk. It makes a big difference for them.”
Through a grant from Invest Atlanta, the city’s official economic development authority, roughly 200 families each month get free access to up to $75 worth of groceries. The market was also approved to accept SNAP on Sept. 30, the day before the start of the shutdown. 
In the month since Goodr began accepting EBT cards, “we definitely saw an increase in our business,” Crowe-Houston said. “Honestly, I’m expecting that to decrease drastically.”
U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, visited the Goodr Community Market on Edgewood on Monday. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat who visited the market Monday, blamed congressional Republicans and the Trump administration for the ongoing shutdown, arguing that they are refusing to work with Democrats to find a compromise that would protect health care access for Americans.
“SNAP recipients were not in this fight, they were dragged into this fight by the administration,” he said. “[Republicans] are literally pitting sick people against hungry people. I can’t think of anything more craven than that.”
He also vowed to keep holding the line on health insurance access.
“As a voice for Georgia, I’m going to continue to fight for health care because it’s a matter of life and death, and I’m going to keep fighting for these SNAP recipients, because food is a matter of life and death,” he said. “And in the meantime, I’m grateful for people like Jasmine, just ordinary citizens who find creative ways to give poor people dignity.”

(Getty Images)A state program to help people with disabilities find employment is running short of funds, the state labor department reported Monday, leading to a waiting list for people seeking the agency’s services.
The Department of Workforce Development will seek $4.6 million from the state Legislature to fully fund the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation in the 2026 fiscal year.
The division serves about 19,000 people at any one time and enrolls about 1,000 new participants each month who have disabilities and are looking for work opportunities, said Haley McCoy, director of communications at DWD.
The unemployment rate for people with disabilities is about twice that for the general population, said Melanie Cairns, managing attorney for Disability Rights Wisconsin.
“The Division of Vocational Rehabilitation provides vital support and services that people with disabilities need in order to work and to find better work,” Cairns said.
Those services include assessment of a person’s current job skills and discussions about the individual’s work goal and what services and supports they need to pursue that goal, Cairns said. Those can include grants for training in a specific occupation or skills, job coaching and other forms of support.
Federal funds cover 78.7% of the program’s cost, with the state required to pitch in 21.3% to match that. The additional state appropriation DWD is seeking would unlock the corresponding additional federal money.
The 2025-27 state budget appropriated $21.3 million in state funds for the 2026 fiscal year — $2.4 million less than the state spent in 2025 and $4.6 million less than what the state had projected it would need, according to DWD.
Unless the shortfall is made up, the agency will have to put potential new participants on a waiting list, according to DWD. McCoy said about 2,000 people are currently awaiting an employment plan through the division and would be put on the waiting list as a consequence.
DWD has scheduled a virtual public hearing for Thursday, Nov. 13, at 2 p.m., to explain the need for the waiting list and seek comment from the public about that prospect.
“We want to find a solution to continue to provide employment services for anyone with disabilities who wants to find a job,” said DWD Secretary-designee Amy Pechacek in a statement Monday. “We welcome the public to participate in this public hearing and are working with all stakeholders to address this issue.”

Across New Mexico in roughly half of the state’s 33 counties, voters will cast their ballots in the Nov. 4 local elections, deciding the outcomes for 997 contests, which include mayors and other municipal officials; hospital board members; soil and water districts; and various school boards.
As of publication early Tuesday morning, 162,586 residents had cast either early or absentee ballots, approximately 11.8% of the state’s nearly 1.4 million voters.
Voter turnout during years without federal races typically runs significantly lower. For instance, turnout for local elections in November 2023 was about 20.5% versus 69% for the November 2024 general election.
New Mexico allows people to register and vote on the same day in person, or register online here. As of publication, 2,369 people had utilized same-day voter registration. Voters who are changing party affiliation, legal name or who have recently moved need to fill out a new registration form.
New Mexico voters must be citizens, older than 18 years at the time of the election, residing in the state and not denied the right to vote by the courts. People on probation or parole are allowed to vote, but not people in jails or prisons. 
The New Mexico Secretary of State offers a service to find nearby polling locations by typing in a ZIP code.

The 50 nonpartisan mayoral races across the state include contests in New Mexico’s capitol and its largest city, which are fielding crowded mayoral races. These municipal contests have adopted different structures than some of the state’s other elections. 
For example, Santa Fe has employed rank choice voting since 2018, which allows voters to rank candidates in races with more than two candidates in order of preference. In ranked-choice voting, a winning candidate must receive a simple majority of the total votes cast. If no winner emerges on the count, candidates with the fewest number of top-ranked votes are eliminated and their second-place candidates are counted, until a candidate crosses the 50%-plus-one vote threshold. 
Voters in Santa Fe’s mayoral race have the option to rank eight candidates vying to replace two-term Santa Fe Mayor Alan Webber, who is not running for reelection. The Santa Fe Clerk’s office says it will be livestreaming the tabulation rounds on its YouTube and Facebook pages.
Both Albuquerque and Gallup have automatic runoffs for their mayoral races. That means if no candidate garners more than 50% of the vote, then the top two candidates in the Gallup and Albuquerque mayoral races will head to a Dec. 9 runoff election, according to the New Mexico Secretary of State’s office.  
In Albuquerque, incumbent Tim Keller faces five challengers for the city’s top position on Nov. 4. They include former U.S. Attorney Alex Uballez and former Bernalillo County Sheriff turned cannabis mogul Darren White. Also in the running are Louie Sanchez, a one-term Albuquerque city councilor and former police officer; Mayling Armijo, a Navy veteran and former economic development director for the city; and Eddie Varela, a former firefighter. 
In Gallup, three challengers are looking to replace current Mayor Louie Bonaguidi, who did not run for reelection.
Beyond candidates, voters will be asked to decide on bonds and ballot questions. 
These includes a request by Albuquerque Public Schools that would allow them to access up to $350 million for construction on school buildings, equipment and matching funds for capital outlay projects from the state.
The City of Albuquerque is also asking voters to approve more than $180 million across 11 bonds, including specific funds for libraries, museums, community centers, police stations and more.  
In Santa Fe, voters will be asked to decide if the city’s governing documents should be amended to change the powers of the mayor and the city council. 
That will include a question asking if voters will approve a change to allow city councilors to remove or suspend the city manager, city attorney or city clerk, if a supermajority of six councilors agree to do so. 
The other question will ask voters to decide if they will amend the city charter to restrict the mayor’s vote to only instances of tie-breaking or if the council had too few members present without the vote. 
Additionally, Santa Fe Public Schools is seeking access to $150 million to improve school facilities and purchase computers. The fourth and final ballot question will ask voters to decide if the district can keep current property tax rates of $150 per $100,000 in assessed property to fund school facilities technology upgrades.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Lone-voter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-04 08:00:33.361585

Instead, the prisoner was allowed to stay and she lost her job.","In summary
A California prison psychologist sought protection after an inmate reportedly threatened her. Instead, the prisoner was allowed to stay and she lost her job.


A jury awarded a $16.8 million judgment to a California prison doctor who alleged her employer did not respond appropriately to a threat she received from an incarcerated person, fired her when she raised concerns about her safety and then defamed her by allowing rumors to spread among staff. 
The verdict, reached last week, caps Dr. Beth Fischgrund’s six-year effort to contest her dismissal from Salinas Valley State Prison, where she worked as a contract psychologist beginning in September 2017.
The jury’s decision “was one of the most surreal experiences of my life,” Fischgrund told CalMatters. “I felt like I finally did get validation. It’s been six and a half years. I felt a lot of the time, ‘Was I going crazy? Was this my fault?’ And to hear each person go up and confirm everything I felt, it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.” 
A spokesperson for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation declined to comment on the case and would not say whether the state plans to appeal. 
The case centered on a high-security yard at the prison in Monterey County. The unit housed incarcerated people who were considered unsafe to live with the general population because of the nature of their offenses, as well as some who had diagnoses for severe mental illnesses.
Fischgrund said she wanted to work with that in a prison because she has a passion for “underserved populations, populations that no one wants to work with.” She joined through a hiring agency, which the state uses because it has a longstanding shortage of prison psychologists and it is under a court order to improve mental health care.
Fischgrund’s complaint, filed in Sacramento Superior Court, alleged one inmate became overly familiar with her, commenting on her appearance and referring to her with an unprofessional nickname. The complaint said another doctor seemed to encourage that overfamiliarity.
The inmate in July 2019 reportedly told another prison psychologist he wanted to cut off Fischgrund’s head, which led clinical staff to alert Fischgrund. 
The doctors talked with Fischgrund about the threat before communicating with correctional staff, who could have removed the inmate or taken steps to protect Fischgrund, according to the complaint. 
That day, Fischgrund sent messages to the prison’s chief of mental health expressing concerns about her safety and asking about procedures to protect staff. She pressed senior doctors for help and answers for several days, the complaint said.
According to the complaint, the inmate spent a little more than a week in solitary confinement before returning to the yard where Fischgrund worked. He reportedly called her name from his cell, which shocked Fischgrund because she believed he was going to be separated from her.
Three days later, Fischgrund sent a message to the corrections department’s headquarters about her safety and about policies to protect staff. The inmate was able to approach her in the prison’s yard that day, as well, the complaint said.
The complaint said she was told the corrections department determined the inmate’s threat was “not credible,” and that he would not be removed from the yard where Fischgrund worked. She was told she could leave that site.
She was fired two days after sending the message to headquarters, the complaint said.
Afterward, Fischgrund said she learned no state prison would hire her as a contract psychologist. She also found that Salinas Valley State Prison placed pictures of her around the institution with her height, weight and date of birth, which were meant to keep her off the premises. She said the flyers stoked rumors about her personal life.
“This is a catastrophic loss for the state of California because they just completely failed to do anything to manage this risk,” said her attorney, Lawrence Bohm of Bohm Law Group. “All Dr. Fischgrund did was try to help the state government do better by these inmates and instead of applauding a whistleball they fired her and crushed her reputation to dust, causing extreme emotional damage that was recognized by the jury.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AP_CaliforniaMedicalFacility_2018_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C699&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-03 19:02:17.580484

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)Election officials across Pennsylvania are ready to ensure a free, fair and safe election Tuesday, Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt said.
Schmidt, who oversees election administration, urged voters to make a plan to vote if they have not done so already, noting that although there are no federal offices on the ballot this year, many important state and local positions are.
“Typically, as you know, there’s lower voter turnout in this election cycle,” Schmidt told reporters in the briefing Monday. “Unfortunately, we want high voter turnout in every election cycle, and there’s really no good reason for it, because these offices are incredibly important.”
Election information including voter registration status, polling place locations, voting rights information and more is available online at vote.pa.gov, Schmidt said.
An unusual election in which three state Supreme Court justices are running for retention has attracted most of the attention this fall. Justices Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty and David Wecht are seeking second ten-year terms on the state’s highest court. All three were elected in 2015 and must face voters in a “yes” or “no” ballot question to continue serving.

Republicans and Democrats have spent millions of dollars on the race, as the outcome will either maintain a Democratic majority on the court or trigger a contested election for the three seats in 2027. 
If any of the sitting justices are voted out, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro would nominate interim justices to serve until the election winners are seated, but his selections are subject to confirmation by the Republican-controlled state Senate.
Other statewide races include elections for one Superior Court seat, one Commonwealth Court seat and retention elections for Superior Court Judge Alice Dubow and Commonwealth Court Judge Michael Wojcik.
Across the state, voters will choose county and local officials, including elections for mayor in Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, Allentown and Scranton and district attorney in Philadelphia. Non-partisan voting rights groups including the League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania and the Committee of Seventy have prepared voting guides. 
Voting by mail has been a popular option again in this year’s election, Schmidt said with more than 1.13 million no-excuse absentee ballots issued and about 73% already returned. He noted that anyone who has not returned a mail ballot should do so in-person at an official county drop box because it’s too late for the U.S. Postal Service to deliver them by the deadline 8 p.m. Tuesday.
“You can’t just put it in the mail tomorrow, or it won’t be counted. It has to be in the hands of the board of elections by then. So at this point, make sure to hand deliver it.
Schmidt reminded voters using mail ballots to follow the instructions, completely fill in the ovals to mark choices and to seal the completed ballot inside the yellow envelope before sealing it in the return envelope, which must be signed and dated where indicated.
Voters who make a mistake or forget to date the return envelope will not have their ballots disqualified this election, as some have in past elections. A federal appeals court ruled in August that the provision that caused some election offices to set aside undated ballots serves no purpose in administering elections and is an unjustifiable burden on voters’ rights.

“Every county is required to count mail-in ballots, even if a voter did not hand date or misdated — like writing their birthday on that outer declaration envelope,” Schmidt said, adding that county election offices time-stamp mail ballots when they are received so they know whether ballots are returned by the deadline.
Voters can check the status of their mail or absentee ballots on the Department of State website.
Voters who have not returned mail-in ballots may also take them to their normal voting location where the mail ballot can be voided and the voter can vote in person. If a mail-in ballot is rejected, not received or gets left at home on election day, voters may also go to their polling place to cast provisional ballots to ensure their vote is counted, Schmidt said.
Schmidt also said voters with disabilities, who are elderly or have limited English proficiency may also receive help voting privately from anyone except an employer or union representative.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolina high schools posted their highest graduation rate in a decade, but about a quarter of students still aren’t ready for college or the workforce, according to state report card data released Monday.
Generally, South Carolina’s schools improved compared to last year, according to the statewide data that gauges how well schools perform based on test scores, classroom surveys and student growth, among other metrics. Education officials applauded a 10-year high in the number of students graduating on time — meaning they graduated four years after entering ninth grade — while saying they would continue pushing for programs to improve how well those students were prepared for life after high school.
“We have to make sure that our diplomas are worth more than the piece of paper that they are written on,” said state Superintendent Ellen Weaver.
Fewer SC graduates went to college this fall, state report card shows

Overall, 270 schools rated “excellent” this year, an increase from 232 last year. The bottom tier of “unsatisfactory” decreased from 49 to 31, and “below average” schools dropped from 186 to 145.
Any time the number of schools in the lowest tier shrinks, that’s good news, since it means children across the state are getting a better education, said Patrick Kelly, a lobbyist with the Palmetto State Teachers Association.
“There’s encouraging information here,” Kelly said of the report cards.
Officials from the state Department of Education and the independent Education Oversight Committee, which is tasked by state law with grading schools, announced the results at Annie Burnside Elementary School in Columbia, which jumped two tiers this year, from “average” to “excellent.”
At the Richland District One school, 83% of the 306 students live in poverty. The school’s big rating boost was due to significant student improvement, as shown by their test scores, and results on a survey about the school’s general environment, according to its report card.
“Our academic gains are no coincidence,” said Principal Janet Campbell. “They are the result of setting measurable goals, challenging our students to reach them and supporting them along the way.”
Graduation rates and readiness
This year, 87% of high schoolers graduated on time, up from 85% last year. That’s worth celebrating, Kelly said.
“Our goal should be for every student in South Carolina who has the ability to earn a high school diploma,” he said.
Three-quarters of students were ready for either college or a career after graduation, a gain of 3 percentage points, according to the state data. Less than a third were ready for both.
Although the gap between students who are graduating and those who are prepared for what comes next continues to shrink slightly, state officials remain concerned about it, Weaver said.
“At the end of the day, we want our students, when they leave a South Carolina high school, to know that that diploma that they carry is a diploma of value,” Weaver said. “This is a diploma that is going to ensure that they are ready to go onto whatever post-secondary success looks like for them.”
Here’s how SC is getting high schoolers ready for a career when they graduate

All 11th graders in the state take a test assessing skills commonly needed for jobs, divided into four areas: math, reading, understanding data and “soft skills,” which include aspects of a job such as dressing professionally and working well with others. Results are graded from 1 to 5, with higher scores suggesting students are ready to pursue more careers.
Students are considered career-ready if they receive a score of 3 or higher on that test, earn a technical education certificate, complete a state-approved internship or receive a high enough score on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery to enlist in the military. This year, 73% of students met that benchmark, compared to 70% last year, according to report card data.
College readiness is based on a student’s score on the ACT or SAT college entrance exam, college credit earned through a dual-enrollment course and/or scores on end-of-course Advanced Placement tests.
One-third of graduating students were college-ready, which is on par with at least the past five years, according to state data. The rate of high school students applying for college also continued to decrease, with 59% reporting filling out applications this year, compared with 61% last year.
A gap between graduation rate and readiness for the next step suggests schools are sometimes passing students without actually imparting the skills they need to succeed in life, Kelly said.
For instance, district policies setting minimum grades teachers can give makes it easier for students to pass their classes, even if they haven’t actually done the work, Kelly said. Alternatives for students who fail tests or classes are sometimes easier, meaning a student can catch up without actually learning the same skills as their peers, he said.
“We’ve put some policies in place that make it harder to evaluate what a student knows and can do,” Kelly said.
Beginning this school year, students can follow a so-called pathway to earn credentials that build on each other every year, allowing students to learn more advanced skills meant to make it easier to find a job in the field they want to pursue, said April Allen, chair of the Education Oversight Committee’s governing board.
“At the same time, we recognize that strengthening the system must go hand-in-hand with addressing the barriers that keep students from wholly engaging in school,” said Allen, who’s also a government relations director for Continental Tire.
Chronic absenteeism and test scores
For example, the number of students who missed at least 10 days of school this year remained a concern, Allen said.
Around 23% of students were chronically absent, essentially the same number as last year. The more days of school a student misses, the less likely they are to perform as expected for their grade level on end-of-year tests, according to a report the committee put out last year.
Those tests, in turn, play a role in determining how well a school or a district is performing. Officials and teachers’ advocates credited the Palmetto Literacy Project and a change in how early educators teach reading for improving English scores, but math scores remain low, with less than half of third- through eighth-graders able to perform on grade level, according to state testing data.
Less than half of SC’s 3rd to 8th graders can do math on grade level, as reading scores surge

Just over half the state’s high school students scored at least a C, which is a 70%, on their end-of-course Algebra I exams, often taken freshman year, according to report card data. Nearly 69% passed their English 2 exams, typically taken sophomore year.
While rooting for improvement, teachers’ advocates also warned against depending too heavily on a single exam score in deciding how well teachers and students are performing. A single, high-pressure exam at the end of the year is not necessarily the best indicator of school performance, said Dena Crews, president of the South Carolina Education Association.
“If people are making judgments based on that, they’re missing a whole lot about schools and districts,” Crews said.
Teacher support
The Department of Education plans to focus on teachers in 2026, Weaver said.
“The No. 1 thing that we have to do to support student learning is take care of our teachers,” Weaver said.
She is asking legislators to raise the minimum pay for a first-year teacher to $50,000, up from $48,500. Legislators have increased the pay floor in increments for years, with the stated goal of reaching $50,000.
SC superintendent wants to keep expanding state-funded teacher bonuses

Weaver is also asking for $5 million to continue a pilot program that awards teachers bonuses based on how well their students perform on tests. She also wants to start a program that offers extra pay to exceptional teachers who mentor others. The additional responsibility would be another way to earn more money without leaving the classroom to go into school administration, she said.
Supporting teachers is key in improving how well schools are performing, Kelly said. The promising results in this year’s report cards came after the first dip in teacher vacancies since 2019, he added.
“It should not be a surprise to see school performance improve as teacher vacancies go down,” Kelly said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4428-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-03 19:02:17.580484

(Provided by the Jeannette Rankin Foundation.)The first major biography of Jeannette Rankin, written by historian Lorissa Rinehart, will be released on Election Day, Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025.
“Winning the Earthquake,” published by St. Martin’s Press, reintroduces Rankin, the Missoula native and national icon who defied all odds to be elected the first woman to serve in the U.S. Congress, said a news release about the new book.
In a video about the book, author Rinehart said in her research, she discovered Rankin would be “just as groundbreaking today as she was in her own time.”
The news release described Rinehart as a women’s historian, author and speaker whose debut book, “First To The Front,” won the acclaim of critics and readers. She is also the voice behind “The Female Body Politic” podcast.
“Born on a ranch in Montana, Jeanette grew up in a time when survival meant everyone working together, men and women,” Rinhart said. “This sense of equality and grassroots democracy shaped her politics.”
A nationwide book tour with Rinehart and the Jeannette Rankin Foundation kicks off at 5 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 6, in Missoula at the Missoula Public Library Cooper Room.

The book signing and conversation will discuss Rankin’s legacy and how her fearless leadership shaped the women’s rights and peace movements of the 20th century, the news release said.
Fact & Fiction will be selling copies of “Winning the Earthquake” at the event and its downtown location.
“As one of the most radical and principled politicians in American history, Rankin’s story is as urgent today as it was in her time,” Rinehart said. “She challenged the status quo, fought for marginalized voices and never backed down.”
Reviewers are describing the book as “a vivid, compelling portrait of a remarkable woman” and “a powerful reminder that Jeannette Rankin paved the way for so many of us,” according to a compilation of early reviews provided with the news release.
“An illuminating biography … ,” said Publishers Weekly. “It’s a gripping window into progressive political history and one woman’s defiance of sexist gatekeepers.”
Born on a ranch in 1880 in Missoula’s Grant Creek Valley, Rankin defied expectations, becoming the first woman to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1917 — three years before women nationwide had the right to vote, the news release said.
She introduced the legislation that led to the 19th Amendment and, in an extraordinary act of conviction, cast the sole vote against U.S. entry into World War II. A lifelong advocate for civil rights and peace, Rankin refused to compromise, despite the personal and political costs.
Karen Sterk, CEO of the Rankin Foundation, said some voters today can credit Rankin for their rights at the ballot box.
“Lorissa Rinehart brings Jeannette Rankin’s trailblazing story back into the national spotlight, where it deserves to be,” Sterk said in a statement. “All Americans have the right to vote today because of her groundbreaking work.
“As the organization dedicated to forwarding Jeannette’s legacy, her impact lives on today through everyone who knows her story and continues to lift women and families.”
Founded with a bequest from Rankin’s estate in 1976 and her directive to lift “mature, unemployed women workers,” the Rankin Foundation carries Rankin’s mission forward by awarding unrestricted education grants and wraparound support services to nontraditional women students across the country, the news release said. Currently, 41 Montana Rankin Scholars attending the state’s seven tribal colleges and the Montana University System are achieving a vocational certificate, associate degree or first bachelor’s degree at the average age of 34.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services has divided the state’s $1 million donation match among the six food banks in Iowa in accordance with the number of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participants per food bank region. 
Gov. Kim Reynolds announced Oct. 30 that funds from DHHS would match monetary donations made to Iowa’s six food banks, up to $1 million, if the federal government shutdown persisted into November and federal food benefits were not issued. 
Congressional leaders did not pass the legislation required to reopen the government Friday and the shutdown slid into its second month, meaning SNAP benefits would not be issued to its nearly 42 million participants.

River Bend Food Bank said in a press release Monday it was “urgently” working to raise $145,000 in order to make the most of the state’s promised donation match. 
The food bank is based in Davenport and serves five counties in eastern Iowa, and 18 in western Illinois. The release said the state would match up to $145,418 of cash donations made to River Bend Food Bank during the SNAP benefits lapse. 
The food bank’s president Chris Ford, said River Bend is experiencing a “surge in demand” at pantry sites. 
“It is essential we tap all available resources for those experiencing hunger and that includes securing the full amount of available matching funds from Iowa,” Ford said in the news release. 
Food banks have the ability to purchase food in bulk from suppliers and say they can stretch each dollar further than an individual shopper, which is why food bank officials have stressed the importance of monetary donations.
As of Monday, other Iowa food banks said they were either not certain of their maximum match amount, or said they were unable to share the figure at this time. 
A spokesperson for DHHS declined to share the maximums for each food bank, but said the department split the $1 million match according to the percentage of SNAP participants that each food bank represents. 
Reynolds, while speaking with reporters Friday, did not say what would happen to the dedicated $1 million in matching funds if less than $1 million were donated to the state’s food banks. 
USDA to issue partial SNAP benefits
The match is only eligible on donations received before SNAP benefits are restored, if they are to be restored in November. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Monday it would partially fund November SNAP benefits using its contingency fund, following a federal judge’s order that the Trump administration pay at least a portion of November benefits. 
USDA is set to issue $4.65 billion from the contingency fund in partial SNAP benefits. USDA officials are working to issue a table that will allow states to calculate the benefits available for eligible households. 
USDA is ordered to pay out these benefits by the end of Wednesday. 
DHHS did not respond to a request for comment about USDA’s plan to issue partial benefits.

 “From apples to carrots to maple syrup and skiing, the food, activities, and landscape we cherish in Vermont are possible in part due to this workforce,” said Naomi Wolcott-MacCausland at the University of Vermont.

Sunrise Orchards in Cornwall has been hustling to harvest 150 acres of apples with the help of 25 Jamaican seasonal workers like Dwayne Brown.
“I pick apples, I pack apples, I prune, and I make cider,” said Brown, 41, who has been working at Sunrise for eight years.
Many of his fellow Jamaican farmworkers, however, have recently left to travel back to the Caribbean island about 3,000 miles away to deal with the devastation recently spurred by Hurricane Melissa.
“All of them are affected,” said farm owner Barney Hodges. “Their homes have been damaged. A lot of them have small farms and those farms were pretty much destroyed.”
Brown said his home and family were spared – he lives on the Kingston side of the island which was damaged the least – but knows many of his fellow workers and friends have not been quite as lucky.
Hodges said he has been helping the farmhands travel back to Jamaica in the aftermath of the strongest hurricane to hit the island nation since 1851. Melissa made landfall last Tuesday with winds of 185 mph, far above the minimum for a Category 5 storm, the strongest classification for hurricanes, according to The Guardian.
Brown was home in Jamaica before it hit and has been tracking the storm in the news from Vermont since it was predicted.
“​​I knew it was going to be a kind of catastrophic, devastating hurricane,” he said. But he did not expect the extent of the “horrible damage” it caused to the western parishes. About 28 people have died in Jamaica, according to BBC News. The death toll is expected to rise.
That disaster — which has also hit Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic — has trickled down to impact Vermont farms, many of which have for years employed seasonal workers like Brown.
Every year, about 450 skilled Jamaican farmworkers travel to the Green Mountain State to help tend, pick and pack produce through the H2A visa program,  according Alyson Eastman, deputy secretary of the Agency of Agriculture, Food  and Markets in Vermont.
Most of the apples Vermonters buy at local markets and farmstands are picked by people from Jamaica. 
“Either an H2A worker picked it, or it was a pick-your-own. Those are usually the two ways you get an apple in Vermont,” she said.
There are likely between 150 and 200 Jamaican farmworkers in the state currently, and Eastman said they are “essential to harvesting the fruits and vegetables that you and I enjoy.”

Vermont has in recent years increased the number of seasonal hires across multiple sectors. Naomi Wolcott-MacCausland at the University of Vermont estimates there are nearly 600 seasonal workers here annually; about 85% of them come from Jamaica. And more than half of those workers come to help on orchards, said Wolcott-MacCausland, program coordinator of UVM’s Bridges to Health program, which helps migrant workers access health services. 
Some come for up to 10 months, helping with everything from pruning to harvesting; others come to help harvest for a 6-week stint. Brown said he typically works at the orchard from August or September through March, April or May.
He said he enjoys the work and the peace and quiet of Vermont. “It’s a good place to work, good company to work for, a good boss who ensures that all is well with us. He takes care of us,” he said. “So yeah, we love to come here to farm.”
In addition to seasonal agricultural workers, Vermont employers hire approximately 1,400 seasonal workers in areas such as food and skiing year round. They come from many countries across the world, including Jamaica, Wolcott-MacCausland said.
Killington Resort in Rutland County, for instance, hires 100 winter workers, and is trying to figure out how to best help them and their families during hurricane recovery efforts, according to Josh Reed, communications manager, who called the situation in Jamaica “heartbreaking.”
“Many have lost their entire homes and are struggling to get food and water. Some are still trying to get in contact with loved ones back home,” he said.
“Vermont has a unique reliance on Jamaican workers, many of whom have been coming to Vermont for decades,” said Wolcott-MacCausland.
“From apples to carrots to maple syrup and skiing, the food, activities, and landscape we cherish in Vermont are possible in part due to this workforce,” she said.  
Local aid efforts
Sixteen of the farmworkers at Sunrise Orchards went home ahead of the storm, and three others left last Thursday, said Hodges, who doesn’t have contact with those who live on Montego Bay — among the worst affected where entire communities and infrastructure have been demolished due to flooding and mudslides, according to news reports.
“The communications are still down. I haven’t been able to reach any of the workers in the hardest hit areas,” Hodges said.
Those he has been in touch with, who live in other parts of the island, told him their properties have been damaged but they and their families are safe, he said. 
“They all are just grateful to be alive,” said Hodges, who recently signed onto a crowdfunding effort to aid Jamaican farmworkers in Vermont.
Established by Champlain Orchards on behalf of Vermont orchards that employ seasonal farmworkers, the Vermont Apple Growers’ Support Fund for Jamaican Seasonal Workers has raised more than $55,000.
“Our workers are hearing stories of severe devastation. They’re just at the end of the harvest season and preparing to go back to Jamaica, and we know they’re going to go back and find some really difficult situations,” said Susan Van Put, marketing project manager at Champlain Orchards. “Because they are like family to us, we want to support them as they go back.”
Champlain Orchards, about 300 acres in Shoreham, is one of the oldest continuously operating orchards in Vermont. It typically employs about 60 seasonal farmworkers from Jamaica each year but had a few less this year because of the drought, Van Put said.
At Paul Mazza’s farmstand in Essex Junction, a sign asking for aid greeted customers on Friday afternoon. The farm has 23 Jamaican workers who are working to finish picking 25 acres of strawberries, and has put out its own crowdfunding appeal that has raised more than $71,000.
“We are just hoping to rally and help them get back on their feet, and rally the community into supporting them,” farm manager Kaity Mazza said. “We’re so happy to have them. Farm work is hard and I think people don’t realize that we wouldn’t be here without them.”
The Chittenden County farm is hoping to put $2,000 in the pockets of each of the farmworkers whose homes and families have been devastated by Melissa, and is also trying to figure out a way to send supplies to Jamaica.
The Vermont Tree Fruit Growers Association has published a list of efforts across the state in support of Jamaican workers affected by Hurricane Melissa. They include Hackett’s Orchard in South Hero and Scott Farm Orchard in Dummerston.
As the death toll nears 50 and relief efforts amplify across the Caribbean, Hodges in Cornwall is making arrangements for some of his remaining farmworkers to travel home.
Jamaicans faced challenging circumstances before the hurricane but are a resilient people, Hodges said. 
“They’re going to figure it out,” he said, “and we want to help them as much as we can.”

(Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska is getting a new state treasurer in Fremont Mayor Joey Spellerberg, the governor announced Monday.
Gov. Jim Pillen announced Spellerberg’s appointment at the same time current Treasurer Tom Briese announced his resignation at a joint press conference Monday afternoon, hours after State Sen. Julie Slama of Dunbar announced her bid for the office. Spellerberg has been mayor of Fremont for five years.

Spellerberg said he plans to submit his resignation as Fremont mayor on Wednesday evening, and will be sworn in as treasurer Thursday. He said Fremont’s City Council president will serve as mayor between elections.
Nebraska’s state treasurer serves a four-year term with an annual salary of $85,000. The treasurer monitors the flow of public dollars for the state, with nearly $20 billion spread among pots of money from the state and federal governments and more. The office maintains a public database on state spending.
Pillen appointed Briese, from Albion, as state treasurer in 2023, replacing the outgoing treasurer John Murante. Prior to that, Briese had served seven years in the Nebraska Legislature.
Briese said he began considering an “exit strategy” roughly one month ago after talking with his wife. While he said he’s open to continuing to serve public office, he said he made the decision to resign to give him more time with his family. Slama had spoken in recent weeks to Republican audiences about her intentions, spurring questions about Briese facing a challenger.

“My home is 110 miles away from here,” Briese said in the state Capitol. “That’s where Joan lives, that’s where my farm is, my grandkids all live within six miles of my home. It really is time for me to spend more time there.”
After learning of Briese’s plan to resign, Pillen said Spellerberg was a “no-brainer” to replace him. Spellerberg, like Slama, had been a candidate for treasurer when Briese was appointed, and Pillen said he determined he was the best choice to fill Briese’s shoes. He did not mention considering any other candidates for the position.
“In business, everybody is interviewing everyday, and that’s how I view it,” Pillen said.
Spellerberg, speaking about his time as mayor of Fremont, said he was proudest of the economic development progress the city achieved under his leadership, including revitalizing its downtown and establishing a municipal inland port authority. He said the work has laid a strong foundation that he hopes will carry Fremont forward.
“I’m just really proud of our people,” Spellerberg said.
As treasurer, Spellerberg will play a role in Pillen’s continued push to lower property taxes. Spellerberg said he will bring his focus on controlling government spending, which he applied as mayor, to his approach for the state.
Spellerberg confirmed he also intends to run in 2026, and Pillen said he would do “everything in (his) power” to support Spellerberg’s campaign. As of campaign finance disclosures filed in January, Slama had $145,000 and Spellerberg had $136,000 in cash on hand. Briese had $2,000.
The deadline for current officeholders to declare a campaign is Feb. 17, while non-officeholders have until March 2.

MONTPELIER — The Vermont Secretary of State’s office is launching a task force with leaders from Gov. Phil Scott’s administration and a number of advocacy groups to boost voter turnout ahead of local, state and federal elections next year.
Vermont already has some of the highest rates of election participation in the country. According to data compiled by Secretary Sarah Copeland Hanzas’ office, which oversees Vermont’s elections, more than 70% of registered voters in the state cast ballots in the last two presidential elections, compared to an average of about 65% of all registered voters nationally.
Voter turnout has been lower in recent non-presidential election years, which are known as midterm elections, according to state data. Primary elections and local races typically see substantially lower turnout figures, as well, regardless of what year they’re held. Turnout is often lower, too, during so-called “off-year” elections, such as Tuesday’s. 
But Copeland Hanzas said Monday at a press conference in Montpelier that the state could do more to improve turnout, specifically, among four groups her office has identified as facing substantial barriers to voting. Those are people experiencing homelessness, people with disabilities, survivors of domestic and sexual violence and people who are incarcerated.
A report earlier this year found that nearly half of surveyed people incarcerated in Vermont and Maine said that they did not know how to vote at the prison where they were held. The report, by the Washington, D.C. based nonprofit The Sentencing Project, also found that people incarcerated in Vermont and Maine had limited access to the paperwork and other resources they’d need to vote, and that staff at prisons in those states lacked the capacity to help them do so.
“We’ve got some foundational challenges there that we want to make sure we address,” Copeland Hanzas said Monday. “No government can say that they have the mandate to do this or to not do that if we don’t have everyone participating in our elections.” 
The task force, which is slated to start meeting later this month, will include leaders from the state Agency of Human Services — which oversees state prisons as well as the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living — as well as Disability Rights Vermont and the Vermont Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, among other advocacy groups.
The push also comes as President Donald Trump has said he wants to “lead a movement” to get rid of a form of voting that 64% of voters used in Vermont last year, including in state prisons: mail-in ballots. Trump says he wants to eliminate mail-in voting before next year’s elections, when control of Congress will be up for grabs.
Part of Trump’s plan, he wrote in a social media post in August, includes signing an executive order that would bar states from using mail ballots and potentially some voting machines. He has said — without evidence — that voting machines are “highly inaccurate,” as well as more expensive to use than processing paper ballots, according to NPR.
Copeland Hanzas said Monday that she was committed to preserving access to mail-in voting in the state. Isaac Dayno, policy director for the state Department of Corrections, added at the press conference that access was critical for people who are incarcerated.
“A person in custody can’t freely browse political news online, can’t register using their correctional facility address, and can’t visit a polling place on Election Day. Mail-in ballots remain their only option,” Dayno said. “Which means preparation, communication and civic education are essential to making sure every vote counts.”

The organization is seeking hundreds more in need amid SNAP uncertainty. (Leah Romero for Source NM)Amid the court rulings and uncertainty encroaching the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, officials at the Las Cruces-based Casa de Peregrinos food distribution center said Monday they are seeing hundreds of additional people seeking help. 
In response to a court order requiring it to pay SNAP benefits, the United States Department of Agriculture said Monday in a legal brief it would pay about half of SNAP November benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, but those benefits could take months to reach recipients. The State of New Mexico announced it would pay $30 million toward food benefits, approximately 10 days worth of benefits, and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said that plan would continue despite the court ruling.
Casa de Peregrinos Executive Director Lorenzo Alba told Source New Mexico that the organization’s Las Cruces distribution center typically sees 3,800 to 4,000 people each month. Numbers were up slightly in September, but he said he recorded around 4,300 to 4,400 people in October. 
“We’re used to giving people 120 pounds of food. We had to scale back to about 85, 90 pounds just to be able to accommodate everybody that’s coming to our doors,” Alba said, adding that he expects the numbers to continue to increase. “We’re going to open up some extra hours and we’ve been doing that. We’ve already started doing that for federal workers on Thursdays.” 
Alba said the organization’s satellite distribution center in Hatch has also seen an increase from about 400 people receiving food monthly on a regular basis to closer to 500 in October. That location also had to scale back how much food they issued to people to ensure they didn’t run out. 
“I think we can handle the 500. If it goes up higher, it’s going to be more difficult.  I don’t have a big staff there, so we’re going to need more volunteers for sure in that area,” he said.
Trump administration to pay about half of November SNAP benefits amid shutdown

 
Alba told Source that Casa de Peregrinos is working with partner organization Roadrunner Food Bank to plan how to ensure everyone coming to their distributions receive adequate food supply. He added that his organization is set to receive part of the $162 million in state funding approved during the recent special legislative session.
Alba said one woman who received food recently told him that if she and her disabled son were to lose their Medicaid benefits and cuts to SNAP benefits continue, she doesn’t know how they will “make it,” despite her already working full-time. Others have told Alba they worry about feeding their children, particularly with school breaks coming up. 
Casa de Peregrinos is also looking ahead to Thanksgiving and its Hope for the Holidays program, which involves handing out whole turkeys and traditional sides to thousands of people during a drive-thru event later this month. Alba told Source that its goal is to distribute close to 6,500 turkeys this year throughout Doña Ana County. Distribution already started in Chaparral this week, but the main distribution event will happen on the New Mexico State University main campus on Nov. 24.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CdP.png,,,2025-11-03 18:17:23.266528

Mike Dunleavy discusses his new proposed omnibus education legislation at a news conference on Jan. 31, 2025. (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)Following a request by state legislators and similar action by other states, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy on Monday declared a 30-day state of disaster that allows the state to temporarily fund federal food-aid programs used by tens of thousands of Alaskans.
The state of Alaska will spend up to $10 million for direct financial assistance to Alaskans who use the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, as much as $5 million per week, the governor said in a letter he sent to Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, and Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, on Monday. 
Funding SNAP for an entire month would cost about $27 million per month, the governor said in a radio interview on Friday. “We don’t have it laying around,” he said, “and I don’t mean that flippantly, but we simply don’t because the money’s dedicated (to another purpose).”
The Dunleavy administration said on Monday it will work with federal contractors to make sure SNAP payments reach eligible Alaskans’ accounts each week and it will direct the Alaska Department of Health to work with food banks, according to a news release from the governor’s office.
An official with the Alaska Department of Health said on Monday afternoon that there was no timeline for when the first payments would reach Alaskans’ electronic benefit cards.
More than 66,000 Alaskans failed to receive their monthly food aid, colloquially known as food stamps, on Saturday. While almost one in 10 Alaskans receives aid through the program, that proportion is higher in rural and poorer parts of the state — Edgmon, who represents part of Southwest Alaska, said half of the residents in parts of his district receive help through SNAP.
Last week, and over the weekend, Dunleavy worked with members of the Legislature to find a way to fund food aid programs with state dollars instead of federal money. In a radio interview on Friday, the governor suggested it might take as long as three weeks to set up a temporary state-paid system, but that timeline accelerated, and now the first state-paid aid could reach Alaskans this week. 
Legislative leaders applauded the governor’s announcement.
“Alaskans shouldn’t have to worry about how they’ll feed their families because of a federal stalemate,” Stevens said in a news release. “I appreciate and support the Governor’s declaration to ensure that Alaskans are not left behind because of inaction in Washington, D.C. Congress must reconcile their differences and act quickly so Alaskans, and all Americans, can continue to have the support and stability to care for their families.”
House Minority Leader Mia Costello, R-Anchorage, said she applauds the governor “for his swift and decisive action.”
“I certainly want to thank Gov. Dunleavy and the Senate President for rolling up their sleeves alongside of myself on behalf of the House Majority caucus and coming up with a short-term solution,” Edgmon said. “This issue, clearly, was code red. … We’re immensely relieved that we have a solution at hand, albeit temporary, and we’ve got fingers crossed that the federal shutdown is going to come to a close here sooner than later.”
The governor’s announcement came as a federal judge ordered President Donald Trump’s administration to pay at least a portion of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance benefits to the 42 million eligible Americans by this Wednesday.
Last Friday, Alaska legislators from both parties expressed their concern about what they called an “impending statewide hunger crisis” in a letter to the state’s congressional delegation.
According to Dunleavy’s letter to lawmakers, the state’s disaster relief funds are not sufficient to cover the cost of the food aid, so the state will transfer $10 million from the Department of Environmental Conservation’s Village Safe Water and Wastewater Infrastructure program. 
The Legislature will be asked to supplement the state’s disaster relief fund and return the money to its original appropriation in the next legislative session.
Meanwhile, the federal government shutdown continued Monday, with Democrats unwilling to vote for a Republican-proposed plan to restart the government, and Republicans unwilling to either relax filibuster rules or amend their restart plan in order to attract Democratic votes.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd) The $5 million from Kentucky’s “rainy day fund” that Gov. Andy Beshear gave to food pantries on Friday is headed to distribution centers with one directive: buy food and give it away quickly.
Melissa McDonald, the executive director of Feeding Kentucky, a network of seven food pantries tasked with disseminating the funds to organizations serving people in need, said the “bulk” of the emergency money will go to the largest banks, God’s Pantry and Feeding America Kentucky Heartland. The other food banks in the network will get the remainder, split based on rates of food insecurity. 
“Their estimated time to spend it is as soon as possible,” McDonald said during a Monday afternoon press conference. 
As soon as Tuesday, she said, many food banks will be able to hit “purchase” on orders of food. The types of food and how it’s distributed will vary by location. As the colder months begin, fresh produce is harder to come by, McDonald said, making for “a tough season.” 
While elderly Kentuckians and children often face higher rates of food insecurity, McDonald said food pantries are seeing “a mix of everyone” in need right now. 
“You’re hitting with the federal shutdown; you’re hitting, also, those individuals that have worked for the federal government that are now missing their second paycheck, and they may never have thought that they would ever be in a situation where they would need food assistance,” she said. “So it’s hitting everyone.” 
As the federal government shutdown drags on, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits have been in limbo. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said in late October that it wouldn’t use contingency funds to keep SNAP benefits flowing, which left 42 million Americans and around 563,000 Kentuckians to face uncertainty about how to afford groceries on Nov. 1. 
Beshear joined other Democrats in suing over the decision, and several judges have said that the Trump administration can’t block the funds. Beshear then declared a state of emergency on Friday and directed $5 million from the state’s budget reserve trust fund to food banks that are part of the Feeding Kentucky network. 
Meanwhile, the USDA announced Monday it will pay about half of November SNAP benefits, but they could take months to make it to recipients’ hands, States Newsroom’s D.C. Bureau reported. 
As that battle unfolds, Feeding Kentucky will continue to get food assistance to people, but the organization’s capacity is far below the federal government’s, McDonald said: SNAP pays for nine meals for every one that food pantries cover across the nation. 
The $5 million in emergency funding “was a nice, big surprise,” McDonald said. But: “The sustainability of this is all going to depend on the federal government. We know what our big push is to make sure that SNAP is funded.” 



How to help
People wanting to help can do so in a variety of ways — through donating food items, money and/or time, McDonald said. 
“In the food bank world, donating dollars will go further than donating product,” she said. “But donating anything is always welcome.” 
Food banks can work with wholesalers and buy food for cheaper than the retail prices most consumers will have to pay, she said. 
Still: “these feeding agencies, food banks and their partners are going to welcome any and everything,” McDonald said.
