Michelle Au, a Johns Creek Democrat, at the Georgia State Capitol on Sept 4, 2025. (Alander Rocha/Georgia Recorder)Survivors of the deadly Apalachee High School shooting gathered alongside Georgia House Democrats at the state Capitol Thursday to renew calls for safe gun storage laws.
Students and family members joined state Rep. Michelle Au, a Johns Creek Democrat, and Georgia House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley of Columbus for a press conference calling on lawmakers to pass legislation they believe is needed to prevent future attacks and arguing that current efforts are not enough to address the trauma and fear that now define their school experience. The Sept. 4, 2024, shooting in the Winder high school left two students and two teachers dead and nine other students injured.
“We all can agree in this room that we need to protect all our children. No child deserves to have the fear of having to go to school. No child deserves to experience what we have experienced. It’s not fair,” said Kyra Lynn McConatha, a recent Apalachee High School graduate who was in class during the attack. “This has followed me from high school and into college.”
Au has previously introduced a bill that would have required gun owners to secure their firearms in a locked container or with a gun lock when a minor is present. The bill failed to move in the 2025 legislative session, but it will remain active when lawmakers reconvene in January.
“To not even discuss [the bill], to not even allow bills like a pretty basic, safe storage bill to be heard in committee, to come to a vote, to be voted on the floor, is noticeable for Georgians and for voters,” Au said after the press conference.
Senate Majority Leader Jason Anavitarte, Dallas Republican, in a separate statement marked the one-year anniversary by saying that Georgia has since moved to protect schools from such deadly attacks. He pointed to House Bill 268, which he said was a result of working with victims’ families and school leaders. The new law, which went into effect on July 1, requires schools to have panic button systems for emergencies and share student data within five school days when a student transfers.
“Georgia has taken bold, practical steps to protect our children, teachers and everyone who sets foot in a school setting. We will continue to listen, learn and legislate with the conviction that school should always be a place of safety, not fear,” Anavitarte said in a statement.
Au responded to Anavitarte’s comment after the press conference, saying that the law was reactive rather than preventative.
“It’s a conspicuous omission to have a bill inspired by this event directed at school safety and have nothing in that bill or nothing in that legislative package that deals with gun safety,” Au said.

Sen. Frank Ginn, a Danielsville Republican who represents a part of Winder, said he attended the press conference after receiving an invite from Au to hear what the lawmakers and students had to say, despite not supporting the efforts to mandate safe gun storage. He said he would support a tax credit incentive for gun storage.

“The safest storage for a firearm is in the hands of somebody that knows how to use it, and I don’t want to put any obstacle in the way of a person who wants to defend themselves and protect their Second Amendment right,” Ginn said.
Layla Contreras, a 2019 Apalachee High School graduate and sister of Sasha Contreras, a current senior who was in class during the attack, said after the press conference that Au’s proposal is “a good start,” but they may have to make some changes to address Republicans’ concerns.
“We just want people to be responsible with it and to be educated on when firearms are around,” Layla Contreras said.
Sasha Contreras said that she has tried over the last year to stay positive and not let the attack define her. She has tried to keep up with schoolwork and is involved in extracurricular activities, but she said she still struggles to maintain her motivation.
“I still try my best to put my best smile on, and I enter that building as positive as I can be,” she said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PXL_20250904_130658086-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-04 16:57:20.235246

Kayvon Powell had previously told WyoFile that officers handled him roughly during an arrest last fall.
The post Lander man alleges excessive force by officers who pepper-sprayed him in lawsuit against police, city appeared first on WyoFile .","A Lander man who accused local police of excessive force during an arrest last fall has sued the city, the department and several officers, alleging police violated his civil rights when they roughly handcuffed and pepper-sprayed him. 
Two Lander Police Department officers arrested Kayvon Powell in September 2024 after stopping him in his car for alleged reckless driving — a charge Powell denied and was never convicted of. The encounter quickly devolved into a shouting match after Powell said he was unable to roll his broken window down and Sgt. Ron Wells instead opened Powell’s car door without permission. 
After an increasingly contentious encounter in which Powell said he feared for his safety, Wells and another officer arrested Powell.
His lawsuit, filed Tuesday, focuses largely on the officers’ use of pepper spray during that arrest, which his attorneys allege violated Powell’s civil rights against unnecessary and unreasonable force. 
WyoFile examined Powell’s allegations of abuse by the officers, and his subsequent trial on charges of interfering with a police officer, for an investigation published in June. During Powell’s trial in April, a Fremont County judge described Wells as “out of line, absolutely 100% out of line,” during the arrest. It was a rare admonishment from a Wyoming judge to a law enforcement officer.

Lander’s interim police chief, Kelly Waugh, and a city official declined to comment on the lawsuit. “Public comment at this time could compromise the City’s legal position and privileged communications,” they wrote in a prepared statement.
Waugh told WyoFile, in an interview this summer, that Wells had “taken full ownership that he did not handle himself appropriately that day.” But Waugh declined to say whether Wells faced any disciplinary proceedings, saying instead that as chief, he was impressed by the sergeant’s willingness to take responsibility for his actions.
In the lawsuit, Powell’s attorneys claim that the officers’ use of pepper spray did not violate the Lander Police Department’s policy at the time. The suit describes the policy as “completely inadequate, improper and unconstitutional.” 
Wells and another officer, Casey Tadewald, ultimately arrested Powell on suspicion of interfering with a police officer, after he declined to show Wells any identification. A Fremont County jury later convicted Powell of the interference charge — a misdemeanor. Prosecutors dropped a reckless driving charge before the trial. Powell has denied that allegation.
Powell is appealing his interference conviction. He is being represented by a public defender in that case and the two matters will proceed independently of each other. 
During the arrest, body camera footage shows the officers treating Powell roughly, though he says he did not resist, as they remove him from his car, handcuff him and take him to a police cruiser. In the lawsuit, Powell’s attorneys say he complied with the officers throughout the arrest, and got in the police car as ordered. 
Once Powell was in the cruiser, Tadewald blasted the back seat of the car, and the handcuffed man, with pepper spray, according to the lawsuit. In Wells’ subsequent police report, he wrote Tadewald used the pepper spray because Powell blocked the car door’s closing with his feet. Powell denied that to WyoFile, and described the pepper spray as a vindictive move by the officers.
His lawsuit echoes that allegation, accusing Wells and Tadewald of using “gratuitous and excessive force” during the arrest. The complaint claims the officers closed the car door successfully. But then Wells opened the door and Tadewald sprayed Powell, the complaint alleges. The suit also alleges that Wells at first kept the rear windows closed as he drove Powell to the Lander jail. 
As Powell pleaded for fresh air and some relief from the pepper spray in his eyes, Wells told him “that’s what you get,” according to the complaint. 
The officers’ “violence, wanton use of pain tactics, and unreasonable use of pepper spray by Defendant Tadewald against Mr. Powell was without legal justification or provocation,” the complaint reads. 
Powell is represented by Spence Law Firm, a well-known law firm out of Jackson. (Storied litigator and firm founder Gerry Spence passed away last month.) Powell is also represented by Lander attorney Bailey Lazzari. 
Powell, a Black man who moved to Lander from Charlottesville, Virginia, sometime after 2017, is bringing a rare lawsuit for Wyoming. Last year, only two claims were filed against Equality State law enforcement officers on constitutional grounds, according to a report from the state insurance pool responsible for covering them. In 2023, there were eight such claims, and the highest number of constitutional claims made against officers in recent years came in 2020, with 13.  
Nationally, fewer than 1% of people who think police officers violated their rights ever file a lawsuit, according to academic researchers. People who do sue the police face a high bar for legal victory, as federal court precedent gives officers wide latitude for actions undertaken on duty. Even cases that survive motions to dismiss are successful only around 15% of the time, according to the Harvard Law Review.
Powell’s lawsuit does not allege discrimination or racism. He previously told WyoFile he believes his appearance has impacted the way local law enforcement treated him in Lander, a claim the police chief denied. 
Following his court case, Powell approached the chief, Kelly Waugh, at a Lander gas station and surreptitiously recorded him. 
The chief conceded to Powell that “what he [Wells] did was very unprofessional,” according to a copy of the recording which Powell previously provided WyoFile. Powell then told the chief he intended to sue the department, prompting Waugh to end the conversation. At that point, Waugh later told WyoFile, the matter needed to be handled by attorneys. 
Despite the chief’s admission that Wells had expressed concern about his own actions during the arrest, the county did not drop its prosecution of Powell, who received probation with a suspended 45-day jail sentence. Lander officials never made any moves to make amends to Powell, attorney Noah Drew of the Spence Law Firm told WyoFile.
“What happened to Kayvon is indefensible,” Drew said. “While the Lander Chief of Police acknowledged it was wrong — the city of Lander has neither apologized nor taken steps to make it right. That silence underscores why cases like this must be brought.”

Jared Polis released a report on the impacts of federal tariffs on Colorado's economy at the governor's mansion in Denver on Sept. 4, 2025. (Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado’s effective tariff rate is seven times what it was last year following sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, according to a new report released by Gov. Jared Polis’ office.
“One thing that’s clear is that everyone loses a trade war,” Polis told reporters at the Governor’s Residence in Denver during a press conference Thursday. “It’s a race to the bottom.”
A tariff is a tax on imported goods. President Donald Trump has imposed a patchwork of tariff rates on different countries, many of them stemming from a 10% baseline tariff on all imports imposed in April. Tariffs currently in effect include 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, 39% on Swiss goods and 15% on goods from the European Union. Trump has also imposed high tariff rates on Canadian, Mexican and Chinese goods — which account for roughly half of Colorado’s imports — but those are in flux as the countries negotiate, and they exclude Canadian and Mexican products included in the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact. There are also individual tariffs on imported cars, steel, aluminum and copper.

Companies that bring foreign goods into the country are responsible for those tariff costs.
“When businesses face high tariffs and the associated uncertainty and confusion, they have difficult choices,” said Jeff Kraft, the deputy director of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade. “Companies are forced to either pass costs onto consumers, which raises prices and can reduce revenue and obviously hurts the consumer, or they have to shift funds to cover the cost of the tariffs internally.”
Polis requested the tariff impact analysis through an executive order in July. The analysis says the estimated effective tariff rate in Colorado last year was 3% but now it has increased to 21%.










Companies are forced to either pass costs onto consumers, which raises prices and can reduce revenue and obviously hurts the consumer, or they have to shift funds to cover the cost of the tariffs internally.


– Jeff Kraft, deputy director of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade


The hardest hit industries in Colorado will likely be agriculture, energy, construction and aerospace. The state’s beef exports, for example, fell by nearly $40 million in the first half of this year compared to last year, and the report’s authors estimate a combined direct and indirect impact of that loss of beef exports to be a reduction of 265 jobs and $80 million of economic output in Colorado.
The Swiss tariffs could have a big impact on Colorado’s aerospace industry, which imports about 73% of its materials from the country. Product-specific tariffs on steel, aluminum and copper could also affect aerospace defense manufacturing. The report considered a potential 5% reduction in foreign demand for Colorado aerospace products and concluded an estimated 195 lost jobs and $61.6 million in gross domestic product loss.
Additionally, tariffs related to imported construction materials and the countries that supply them could increase construction costs for new homes by 4% to 6%, according to the report.
“There’s no doubt that any costs associated with tariffs are directly incorporated into construction costs and into housing costs,” Polis said. “Of course, we’re doing everything we can to reduce the cost of construction as a state, and this works counter to that goal.”

There is potential that the tariffs will impact state revenue as well, because they are expected to weaken consumer spending and slow economic growth. The state could lose about $240 million in general fund revenue during the current fiscal year and about $450 million next fiscal year if the current tariff rates hold. That is a potential estimate and not part of an official economic forecast, which will come later this month.
The Colorado Legislature recently wrapped up a special session to raise revenue to soften the adverse impacts of the recent federal spending and tax cut bill.
Colorado was part of a coalition of states that sued the Trump administration over the tariffs imposed using emergency authority. An appeals court found that most of those tariffs were an illegal use of the emergency powers law, but the decision left the tariffs in place for now and Trump is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case.
Polis is hoping the courts will negate the tariffs, and he called on Congress to do more. The state does not have any power regarding this international trade policy.
“We really hope that Congress shows a spine and pushes back against costly increases through tariffs and try to change the mind of the president in the White House,” he said. “Congress absolutely can limit the authority of a president. They can do that in the spending bills that they’re considering right now. They can restrict the ability of any president to unilaterally impose tariffs.”

(Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)The fate of a voter-approved measure to slow Washington’s shift from natural gas toward technology like electric heat pumps will be decided by the state Supreme Court.
Chief Justice Debra Stephens signed an order Wednesday to have Washington’s high court directly review a lower court ruling invalidating Initiative 2066 that passed last November. 
The initiative targets changes to the state energy code that offer builders incentives in the permitting process for choosing electric heat pumps – which provide both heating and cooling in the same unit – instead of natural gas furnaces.
And it seeks to repeal provisions in a year-old state law intended to accelerate Puget Sound Energy’s transition away from natural gas. It prevents approval of utility rate plans that end or restrict access to natural gas, or make it too costly. 
In March, King County Superior Court Judge Sandra Widlan struck down the measure. She ruled that it is unconstitutional because it runs afoul of a provision limiting citizen initiatives to no more than one subject and requiring them to contain the full text of the portion of state laws they would alter. 
Widlan said the purpose of the single subject requirement is to prevent “logrolling”’ or pushing through “undesirable legislation by attaching it to desirable legislation.”
Initiative sponsors maintain it complies with all constitutional constraints and sought direct review by the state Supreme Court.
“Every single section of 2066 addresses protecting the choice to access and use natural gas,” said Greg Lane, executive vice president of the Building Industry Association of Washington, in a statement. “The initiative was clear and voters clearly understood they were voting for energy choice.”
Attorney General Nick Brown disagrees with the policy but believes voters passed an initiative that is constitutional.
“My job as Attorney General is to enforce and defend the laws of Washington and I will continue to vigorously do so in this case,” he said in May after petitioning the state high court to take the case.
Nearly 52% of voters backed the measure in November.
Weeks later a coalition of groups and elected leaders filed a lawsuit challenging its legality. Foes of the measure didn’t oppose the state high court taking the case.
A spokesman for one of the litigants said they are confident the justices will rule against the initiative.
“We are committed to ensuring that initiative 2066 is overturned, and that Washington remains a leader in the transition to clean and affordable electricity,” Dylan Plummer, campaign advisor for the Sierra Club’s Building Electrification Campaign, said in an email.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/0-2.jpg,,,2025-09-04 16:57:20.235246

The $5.09 billion request marks a 1.7% decrease from the previous year, according to Public Education Secretary Mariana Padilla’s presentation.
However, Padilla noted several missing elements in the request, including compensation bumps; insurance costs; and all of the components of the court-ordered remedial action plan for the long-running Yazzie/Martinez education equity lawsuit, as it’s not due until October. 
She asked the committee and LESC staff to take this information into account as they develop their own budget requests for public education over the next several months.“This budget has been submitted by the department about three months sooner than we typically do,” Padilla told lawmakers. “A lot of hours go into looking at our programs, looking at the needs. Deep discussions with our staff, as well as our stakeholders.”
Padilla said the budget also does not include an increase in K-12 Plus Program funding due to enrollment declines and shorter calendar years. The K-12 Plus Program provides schools with additional funding for days added to the calendar above the legislatively required 180 days for five-day learning weeks.

“The average school calendars statewide have been reduced by two school days,” she said. “Schools, as they set their own calendars — as they do every year — we’re seeing on average two fewer days. We’ll be able to finalize our K-12 Plus numbers in October when we go through that reporting period.”
Padilla’s presentation highlighted several areas of priority, including educator recruitment and quality; literacy; student nutrition; accountability; academic interventions and supports; math and STEAM; special education; graduation; and school safety. The budget includes $37.3 million for educator and leadership training and teacher pipeline programs.
The secretary pointed out that New Mexico public schools had about 681 teacher vacancies last academic year, or a 3% statewide vacancy rate. The request for training funds also includes money for implementing and growing the newly required school board training requirement, to ensure school leaders are knowledgeable in state law and their responsibilities to the schools, educators and students.
The department’s budget also includes $57 million for literacy, including implementing structured literacy and training, as well as summer reading programs. Padilla told lawmakers that she hopes to include math in the summer programs next year to expand interventions for students struggling in the subject.
A separate $9.8 million is included in the budget specifically for math and STEAM subjects and introducing a method for teaching the topics that is similar to the structured literacy approach.
LESC Chair Sen. Bill Soules (D-Las Cruces), a former math educator, told committee members that the PED’s budget request is a good place to start the conversation for the committee’s budget and possible bills to introduce in the 2026 lLegislative session that begins on Jan. 20, 2026. He also said the LESC might look at boosting funding in its budget proposal for several areas, including math and science. 
“I’ve been around long enough to know that we ought to ask for what we want and not negotiate against ourselves as educators, and make somebody else have to make the cuts rather than think what they’re going cut and do it for them, and then they’re going to cut more anyhow,” Soules said during the meeting. He added that the state is in a good financial position and should be looking at devoting more funds to education rather than allocating so much to the permanent fund for investment. 
“We’re a wealthy state, we are sending billions of dollars a year into the permanent fund,” Soules said. “We need to be taking care of New Mexico, New Mexicans and the investments we make in our kids will have bigger dividends than the 5 or 7% that’s going to be churned out by putting the money into the permanent fund.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/teacher-in-a-classroom-1536x864-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-04 16:57:20.235246

This story by Jason Starr was first published in the Williston Observer on Sept. 4, 2025.
Champlain Valley School District finance leaders on Tuesday previewed the details of a $13 million bond question they plan to put to voters at Town Meeting Day.
District Facilities Director Chris Giard outlined an array of upgrades and maintenance projects that the bond funds would cover across multiple school buildings within the five-town district.
In Williston, $1.4 million would be spent on replacing both the floor in the front gymnasium, which currently has troublesome moisture underneath, Giard said, as well as the controls for the school’s light and heating-ventilation systems. Replacement parts for the current control systems are difficult to obtain, according to Giard.
At Champlain Valley Union High School, a roof replacement and heating-ventilation system overhaul would take up the majority of the $4 million in bond funds that would be allocated to the high school. Also in the work plan is a fire alarm system replacement.
Another $4 million in projects are planned at Hinesburg Community School, including roofing, heating-ventilation and electrical work. At Charlotte Community School, $2.9 million would go to installing an elevator that meets Americans with Disabilities Act requirements, new gym bathrooms and new siding.

The district is also planning a conversion to LED lights across all its buildings. That project is estimated at $700,000.
“We have a lot of fluorescent bulbs and fixtures to get rid of,” Giard said.
The bond question, if approved for the Town Meeting Day ballot by a school board majority, would be on the ballot next to the district’s funding request for the upcoming fiscal year. District Chief Operations Officer Gary Marckres said he plans to develop a budget draft by the end of September. A community budget forum is scheduled for Oct. 25 at CVU.
The September draft will be an estimate of the budget if all current staff and services remain in place — and an estimate on the impact to property tax rates — Marckres said. With the Vermont Legislature considering wholesale changes to the way public education is funded under Act 73, “this may be our last chance in the next 4 to 5 years to have a level service budget,” Marckres told the school board’s finance committee Tuesday.
Act 73 has the potential to stifle the flow of funds that support the district, redistributing them in a new statewide formula.
“We won’t have the funding to look like we look and do what we do,” Marckres said. 
The legislation contemplates merging school districts, and lawmakers plan to consider new school district maps during the 2026 legislative session. But leaders at the school district — already the largest in the state — are intent on resisting any merger with neighboring districts.
“It’s the right size right now,” Champlain Valley School District Superintendent Adam Bunting said of the district. “I’m reluctant to talk about any merger.”

Michelle Lujan Grisham will convene lawmakers on Oct. 1 for a special legislative session, her office announced Thursday, to tackle federal cuts to Medicaid and other services, among other issues.
The governor’s office began floating the possibility of a special session even before July 4, when President Donald Trump signed H.R.1, the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” a federal spending bill that contains significant cuts to the state’s Medicaid and nutrition programs. 
“New Mexicans should not be forced to shoulder these heavy burdens without help from their elected officials,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “After discussions with legislative leaders, we’ve resolved to do everything possible to protect essential services and minimize the damage from President Trump’s disastrous bill.” 
The bill contains multi-billion-dollar cuts, the governor’s office said, that threaten “the survival of New Mexico’s health care system, particularly in rural areas.” 
The news release listed several areas that lawmakers plan to address, including:

funding to the Rural Health Care Delivery Fund to “allow stabilization grants for quality health care providers;”
making health insurance premiums more affordable in the marketplace and for those losing Medicaid;
funding for public broadcasting;
new investments in food assistance; and
resources for the Health Care Authority as it prepares for Medicaid enrollment changes

The governor is also discussing with lawmakers whether the session will address “behavioral health challenges that affect our criminal justice system and community safety,” according to the news release. Lujan Grisham expressed dissatisfaction at the end of the regular legislative session earlier this year with lawmakers’ approach to crime and said then that she would consider a special session for that topic alone. 
A news release from state Senate Republicans indicated they were preparing for that possibility with legislation to address New Mexico’s “juvenile crime crisis” and hold “repeat criminals accountable.” The news release also listed legislation that would “protect the state’s ‘most vulnerable children'” and reform medical malpractice law as Senate Republican priorities.
Medicaid, ICE detention on agenda for forthcoming special legislative session

(Photo by Shahrzad Rasekh/CT Mirror)Two weeks ago, Prospect Medical Holdings said an announcement regarding initial bids for its three Connecticut hospitals — Waterbury Hospital, Manchester Memorial and Rockville General — was imminent.
The company has yet to disclose any details on interested buyers.
Experts say that could be a sign the facilities aren’t attracting strong interest in the court-supervised sale — part of a months-long bankruptcy proceeding the company filed in January.
During a hearing on Aug. 20, a lawyer for Prospect said several times that the company would announce initial bidders for the Connecticut hospitals within days. But, as of Thursday, Prospect still had not named a “stalking horse bidder,” the first bidder in a bankruptcy auction whose offer serves as the minimum bid.
Prospect must complete the sale auction for the Connecticut hospitals by Sept. 19 and a final order approving the transaction must be entered by Oct. 3, according to a recently updated agreement with one of its lenders.
The company has already missed several such deadlines.
Roughly a month after Prospect filed for bankruptcy protection, the company set a timeline for the Connecticut sale, including a bid deadline of late May 2025 and a sale hearing, where the court would approve a new owner, for June 5, according to court documents submitted to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of Northern District of Texas.
“Most likely, if in the last six to eight months they have not teed up a sale for the Connecticut hospitals, it means they’re probably having difficulty finding a buyer,” Ken Rosen, a bankruptcy attorney with experience in the health care industry, said. He added that it’s possible Prospect has a buyer lined up but that the parties have not yet been able to agree on price or contract terms.
Spokespeople for Prospect Medical Holdings did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Matthew Beatman, a Bridgeport-based bankruptcy attorney, also said the delays could be concerning and added that the timeline extensions likely reflect a major effort underway to avoid hospital closures.
“The preference would be to see a private party come in, or private parties come in, and have some continuation for one or all of [the hospitals],” Beatman said. “Whether or not that’s feasible and going to happen, no one knows. But it sounds like no one wants to give up yet.”
But in the case of some Prospect-owned hospitals, closures were unavoidable.
Prospect shuttered its two remaining Pennsylvania hospitals earlier this year after failing to find a viable buyer, even after the state provided more than $15 million over seven months to help keep the facilities open.
In Massachusetts, Steward Health Care, another formerly private equity-backed hospital operator that declared bankruptcy in May of last year, closed two hospitals after failing to receive any qualified bids for the facilities.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont, said the administration is preparing for all possible outcomes.
“The state has been actively working for many months now to prepare for any eventuality that may occur with these facilities to ensure continuity of care and preserving these community assets.”
When Prospect filed for bankruptcy in January, Lamont vowed to keep the hospitals open.
But, months later, as part of a broader agreement, the state Office of Health Strategy granted Prospect permission to convert one of its three Connecticut hospitals — Rockville General in Vernon — from a full-service acute care hospital into a satellite campus of Manchester Memorial Hospital, located 20 minutes away. While not technically a closure, the agreement cleared a path for Prospect to permanently shutter all services aside from the emergency and behavioral health departments.
During the same August hearing where a Prospect lawyer said bids for the Connecticut hospitals were imminent, the company also admitted that none of the offers it had received to date were as high as a $435 million offer Yale New Haven Health agreed to pay for the facilities in April 2022.
The attorney also discussed a motion Prospect filed seeking to hold Yale New Haven to the terms of the deal. If the motion is successful, Yale would either have to purchase the hospitals for $435 million, pay a penalty to Prospect or challenge the company in court. The bankruptcy court judge is slated to decide whether to grant that request in a hearing scheduled for Sept. 23.
During the hearing, the judge encouraged Yale and Prospect to enter into mediation talks.
Dana Marnane, a spokesperson for Yale New Haven Health, confirmed that the health system had agreed to mediation talks. But she declined to provide any additional information on what potential outcomes could be, including whether Yale New Haven would consider purchasing the hospitals at a lower price.
“At the request of the court overseeing Prospect’s bankruptcy proceedings, Yale New Haven Health has agreed to meet with Prospect and other parties, including representatives from the State of Connecticut,” Marnane stated in emailed comments.

The lawsuits — one filed by the project’s developers and the other by attorneys general for Rhode Island and Connecticut — came nearly two weeks after federal officials ordered an immediate shutdown of all offshore work on the 704 megawatt project.
At the time, Revolution Wind had already completed 80% of the work, including dozens of turbines mounted onto foundations set into the seafloor.
Gigantic sections of unfinished turbines were already on the ground at the State Pier in New London, where more than 100 workers are employed within the project’s staging area. Another 50 workers were told not show up for a two-week shift installing new turbines at sea, according to union officials.
“This is an utterly unlawful, baseless and frankly senseless and stupid stop-work order,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong told reporters during a press conference at his office in Hartford. 
“That’s why we’re in federal court today, along with our partners in Rhode Island, in federal court to stop Donald Trump and his all-out war on wind and wind power, and frankly, on ratepayers,” Tong continued.
Tong’s office said its lawsuit would be filed in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island with his counterpart in that state, Democratic Attorney General Peter F. Neronha. The other lawsuit was filed Thursday morning in federal court in Washington, D.C., by developers Ørsted and Skyborn Renewables.
Both lawsuits named the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which issued the stop-work order, as defendants. Tong said his lawsuit would also name President Donald J. Trump as a defendant.
“While Revolution Wind will continue to seek to work collaboratively with the Administration and other stakeholders toward a prompt resolution, it believes that BOEM lacked legal authority for the stop-work order and that the stop-work order’s stated basis violated applicable law,” Ørsted spokesman Karl-Erik Stromsta said in a statement. “The project is facing substantial harm from continuation of the stop-work order, and as a result, litigation is a necessary step.”
Officials with both the Department of the Interior and the BOEM declined to comment on the ligation Thursday.
White House spokesman Taylor Rogers defended the administration’s actions, saying in a statement that offshore wind projects had been given “unfair, preferential treatment,” under the previous administration of President Joe Biden.
“President Trump’s day one executive order instructed agencies to review leases and permitting practices for wind projects with consideration for our country’s growing demands for reliable energy, effects on energy costs for American families, the importance of marine life and fishing industry, and the impacts on ocean currents and wind patterns,” the statement said. “President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security.”

While the decision to halt work on Revolution Wind was widely condemned by local officials, union leaders and environmental advocates, Gov. Ned Lamont had initially signaled hope last week that a deal could be worked out with the Trump administration to save the project.
Lamont pointed to an example earlier this year when federal officials halted work on another wind project under development in Brooklyn, N.Y., Empire Wind, only to reverse course after New York Gov. Kathy Hochul expressed a willingness to work with the administration to approve new gas pipelines.
Over the last two weeks, however, state officials say attempts to engage with their federal counterparts have gone nowhere. In a statement Thursday, Lamont said the Trump administration has yet to explain or justify its stop-work order.
“There is still a path forward if Washington is willing to be a partner,” Lamont said. 
In its letter to Ørsted last month ordering the company to stop work, the BOEM cited unspecified concerns having to do with “national security interests” and “interference” with the use of various maritime areas as its reason for the decision.
Tong, however, called that explanation “garbage,” adding that any issues had already been resolved by BOEM and the Department of Defense.
“All of those questions were addressed in the permitting process,” Tong said. “That’s what the permitting process is for.” 
The attorney general’s latest suit on Thursday was not the first to challenge the Trump administration’s actions toward offshore wind. In May, Tong joined with more than a dozen other Democratic attorneys general in a lawsuit seeking to block the administration’s decision to stop leasing new offshore areas for wind development.
That lawsuit remains pending. On Thursday afternoon, there was a hearing in the case in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts.
Attorneys in that case filed notices late last week to inform the court of the BOEM’s decision to halt work on Revolution Wind. The judge overseeing the case, William G. Young, said the decision to halt a fully-permitted project “creates a host of issues,” but he also said that action was somewhat different than the dispute before him, which deals mostly with the approval of future projects.
The Revolution Wind project was originally approved in 2023 as a partnership between Ørsted, a Danish energy company, and Eversource. The utility later sold its stake in the project to Skyborn Renewables, a division of Global Infrastructure Partners.
The initial $1.5 billion pricetag for the project has also risen substantially amid a wider trend of escalating costs within the offshore wind industry.
In their lawsuit Thursday, attorneys for the developers did not cite an exact figure but said the companies have already spent “billions of dollars” toward completing the project. Stromsta, the Ørsted spokesman, declined to say how much the stop-work order had cost the project.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/LAMONT-WIND-0825-DE-SONY-107-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-04 16:57:20.235246

(Pool photo by Bethany Baker/The Salt Lake Tribune) The Utah Supreme Court called off the execution of Ralph Menzies last week nearly 40 years after he murdered Maurine Hunsaker, opening the door for more court hearings and evaluations to determine the extent of the 67-year-old’s dementia.  
Now, the Utah Attorney General’s Office is asking the court to move as quickly as possible, warning of an “endless cycle” of petitions pointing to Menzies’ mental decline. 
In a motion filed Wednesday, the attorney general’s office requested Utah’s 3rd District Court expedite future proceedings related to Menzies, who will soon be evaluated by medical professionals to determine whether he still understands why the state is trying to execute him. 
According to Utah code, medical professionals will have at least 60 days to evaluate Menzies, but the attorney general’s office is asking the court to cut that timeline to 30 days.

“This is a 39-year-old case on a murder that Menzies committed nearly 40 years ago,” the request reads. “This Court should expedite Menzies’ second round of competency proceedings to prevent an endless cycle of successive competency petitions based on changes in Menzies’ condition.” 
The request comes on the heels of a Friday afternoon ruling from the Utah Supreme Court, which found that Menzies’ attorneys had submitted enough evidence to warrant a second competency evaluation. Competency evaluations are done when a death row inmate shows signs of mental decline — per state and federal law, a death row inmate must understand the reason for their punishment and that their crime was particularly heinous before their execution. 
Death row inmate Ralph Menzies wins appeal, Sept. 5 execution called off

Menzies was already examined by several doctors and psychologists last year, and was found competent to be executed in June. Then in July, Menzies’ attorneys filed a request for a second evaluation, arguing that his dementia had worsened since the initial reviews. 
That request was denied, but Menzies’ ultimately won his appeal before the Utah Supreme Court, which issued its opinion just a week before his scheduled firing squad execution. 
The high court’s ruling triggers a new set of proceedings, requiring evaluations from at least two Utah Department of Health and Human Services examiners, as well as any other independent examiners commissioned by either the state or Menzies’ attorneys. 
Once a judge issues an order, those examiners have 60 days to submit their reports — once the court receives the reports, a hearing must take place within 15 days. 
Hypothetically, if the judge rules next week, the reports would be due sometime in early November, with the hearing likely scheduled in the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving. 
But the attorney general wants to cut that window in half. According to the court filing, the state is asking for a 30-day timeline, and a hearing set five days after the reports are received. 
“As Menzies’ counsel argued to the supreme court, ‘his condition is always changing’ such that ‘it is difficult to keep up with,’” attorneys for the state write. “That all means time is of the essence.”
In separate filings submitted Thursday, the attorney general’s office requested two psychologists — David Thompson, a forensic psychologist, and Ryan Green, a neuropsychologist — to evaluate Menzies. Both men have previously examined Menzies, and found that he did show some signs of mental decline, but was competent.

Data centers promise tens of millions of dollars  in tax revenue, new jobs and investment in energy infrastructure. A planned Brandon data center alone is expected to bring in over $20 million a year in taxes.
But not everyone is thrilled. 
In my latest story on the Brandon data center, I talked with Brandon residents and Rankin’s economic development association about the development. Residents raised concerns about electricity and water usage, air pollution from electricity demands, potential noise pollution and environmental impacts.

Katherine Lin
In other communities across the nation and globe where data centers are being built, residents are raising similar concerns. They want to know what these projects mean for their health, the environment and their pocketbooks. But artificial intelligence continues to grow. The investment bank UBS projects that AI spending will reach $500 billion in 2026. 
Professor Ahmed Saeed of Georgia Tech says data centers are not going away. He thinks the way forward is to ensure they’re properly regulated and investing in the community.
“ Having clarity on the impact of data centers within the community where they’re building is important,” said Saeed. “The other side of this is also making sure that there is investment into the community.”
We received a lot of emails in response about Brandon’s new data center. We’re reprinting one of the comments we received, with permission from the author:
“I am deeply concerned about the new data center projected for construction in Brandon, Mississippi. I believe this is a terrible idea and should be reconsidered by our state leaders. Mississippi prides itself on outdoor recreation and agriculture, yet this very decision will impact the land and natural resources in such a harmful way. Our water and energy will surely suffer through egregious water and electricity consumption. We need businesses to move into cities who will contribute to the local community and local economy, not filter resources away from people in that community,” wrote Miranda Loper, MLIS.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Hours before a federal judge in Boston was set to hear arguments on the Trump administration’s executive order stopping offshore wind reviews, two separate lawsuits seeking to reverse the recent stop work order on nearly completed Revolution Wind project were announced Thursday.
Revolution Wind, a joint venture between Ørsted and a consortium led by Skyborn Renewables, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. challenging the stop work order issued Aug. 22 by the U.S. Department of Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). The multibillion dollar project was 80% complete and scheduled to begin delivering 704 megawatts of power to 350,000 homes across Rhode Island and Connecticut starting in mid-2026. 
Meaghan Wims, an Ørsted spokeswoman, said the company will continue to seek to work collaboratively with the Trump administration and other stakeholders but believed the federal government lacked legal authority for the stop work order. All required federal and state permits for the 65-turbine wind farm in Rhode Island Sound were secured in 2023 after a review process that lasted seven years. 
“The project is facing substantial harm from continuation of the stop-work order, and as a result, litigation is a necessary step,” Wims said.
Soon after Ørsted filed its lawsuit, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha informed reporters of his intention to file a lawsuit with his Connecticut counterpart seeking to reverse the Trump administration’s decision. The lawsuit was filed Thursday afternoon in the U.S. District of Rhode Island in Providence. It had not yet had been assigned a case number as of 4 p.m., said AG spokesperson Timothy Rondeau.
“We have begun and built an industry here in Rhode Island that can continue to grow and provide jobs to Rhode Islanders and build our economy,” Attorney General Peter Neronha told reporters at a morning press conference in his Providence office. “We’re on the cusp of building that economy, and the president stopped it unlawfully.”
Neronha said he chose to team up with the Connecticut Attorney General William Tong because of the stoppage’s direct impact on southeastern New England. 
ISO New England, the entity responsible for operating the region’s electric grid, has warned that delaying completion of Revolution Wind could increase risks to reliability.
The joint lawsuit claims the stop work order would also hurt the economies of Rhode Island and Connecticut, saying the project’s construction phase supports more than 2,500 jobs nationwide, including 1,000 union jobs in the two states that would benefit from the wind farm.
“And no one knows what’s going to happen next,” Rhode Island AFL-CIO president Patrwick Crowley said in an interview after Thursday’s press conference.

Both lawsuits call the Aug. 22 decision by the U.S. Department of Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management “arbitrary and capricious” and claim that the administration acted unlawfully in suspending work.
Specifically, the two complaints claim the Trump administration violated the Administrative Procedures Act and exceeded its authority under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, citing a lack of reasoned decision-making and disregard for state interests.
“With zero justification, Trump wants to mothball the project, send workers home, and saddle Connecticut families with millions of dollars in higher energy costs,” Tong said in a statement. “This kind of erratic and reckless governing is blatantly illegal.”
Neronha likened the Trump administration’s decision to a yo-yo bouncing back and forth over policy decisions.
“And if he wants to behave like a yo-yo, that’s up to him,” Neronha told reporters. “But you can’t run government that way — decision-making has to be rational.”
In issuing the work stoppage, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said it was “seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests.” But what exactly that means is still something state officials are trying to find out from the Trump administration.
U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner sought to get an answer from a Department of Interior official who testified at a hearing on mining-related legislation before the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources Wednesday afternoon.
“The stop work order speaks for itself,” Adam Suess, acting assistant secretary for lands and minerals management, replied to Magaziner. “Because the project is under review, and consistent with the president’s Jan. 20 memorandum, I have nothing else to say at this point.”
“With all due respect: Bullshit,” Magaziner responded.


A week after the stop work order on Revolution Wind, on what was the Friday before the Labor Day holiday weekend, came a decision from the U.S. Department of Transportation terminating a total of $679 million in funding to support offshore wind-related ports and manufacturing facilities. The projects included $11.25 million for port infrastructure upgrades at Quonset Point in North Kingstown.
That decision led U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse to withdraw his support for the nomination of Sean McMaster to serve as Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration in a speech on the Senate floor Thursday morning Whitehouse had voted for McMaster in committee on June 11.
“This bad faith decision was a punch in the face to Rhode Island’s premier port, and I cannot support McMaster’s nomination until this funding is restored,” Whitehouse said.
Gov. Dan McKee on Wednesday sent a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, outlining the consequences of the stop work order and asked to meet with President Trump on the matter. But he has yet to receive any update from the Trump administration, spokesperson Andrea Palagi confirmed to Rhode Island Current .
“Words with the Trump administration, as I think has been demonstrated, are simply not enough,” Neronha said Thursday. “Unless you do something, this president’s not going to change behavior.”
Climate Action Rhode Island, a group of advocates who led the state’s Yes to Wind campaign,  praised Neronha for filing the lawsuit. 
“Revolution Wind has passed every state and federal review,” Executive Director Jeff Migneault said in a statement. “For a president to step in now and try to derail it is flat-out un-American.”
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson also lauded the legal move.
“This project is essential for our economy, the environment, and the affordability of our energy supply,” the pair of legislative leaders said in a joint statement Thursday afternoon.
Elizabeth Peace, a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior, declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.

Kennedy Jr.  vehemently defended his actions on vaccines and other public health issues under questioning by both Republican and Democratic senators during a contentious hearing Thursday.Kennedy, confirmed on a mostly party-line vote earlier this year, repeatedly justified firing everyone on an influential vaccine advisory panel, as well as the president’s decision to remove a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director who’d served for less than a month after confirmation by the Senate.“In your confirmation hearings, you promised to uphold the highest standards for vaccines. Since then, I've grown deeply concerned,” said Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo. “The public has seen measles outbreaks. Leadership of the National Institutes of Health questioning the use of mRNA vaccines. The recently confirmed director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fired. Americans don't know who to rely on.”Video courtesy of C-SPAN.Barrasso, an orthopedic surgeon, sought to reinforce support for vaccines to Kennedy during the Senate Finance Committee hearing, saying they “are estimated to have saved 154 million lives worldwide.”Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician who received several concessions from Kennedy in exchange for voting to confirm him as HHS secretary, raised numerous questions about Kennedy’s behavior. Cassidy is the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.Cassidy appeared to box in Kennedy on the COVID-19 vaccine by saying President Donald Trump should receive the Nobel Prize for Operation Warp Speed, which led to the development of the shot during his first term. Kennedy agreed Trump should ""absolutely"" get the prize, leading Cassidy to question why he’d taken actions as HHS secretary to erode trust and eliminate funding for vaccine development activities. “It surprises me that you think so highly of Operation Warp Speed when, as an attorney, you attempted to restrict access,” Cassidy said. “It also surprises me because you've canceled, or HHS did, but apparently under your direction, $500 million in contracts using the mRNA vaccine platform that was critical to Operation Warp Speed.”Cassidy said the cancellation represents not only “an incredible waste of money but it also seems like a commentary upon what the president did in Operation Warp Speed, which is to create a platform by which to create vaccines.”Cassidy also questioned Kennedy’s actions eliminating everyone on the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and replacing them with his own choices. “If we put people who are paid witnesses for people suing vaccines, that actually seems like a conflict of interest,” Cassidy said. Kennedy disagreed, testifying that “it may be a bias. And that bias, if disclosed, is okay.”Tillis asks RFK Jr. to respond in writingNorth Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis asked Kennedy a series of questions but said he wanted the secretary to submit his answers in writing in order to clarify several of his positions. “Some of your statements seem to contradict what you said in the prior hearing,” Tillis said. “You said you're going to empower the scientists at HHS to do their job. I'd just like to see evidence where you've done that, and I'm sure that you will have some.”Tillis said he wanted Kennedy to respond to reports that he’s gone back on his commitments to senators to not do anything “that makes it difficult or discourages people from taking vaccines” and that Kennedy would not “impose my belief over any of yours.”“That, again, seems to be contradictory to the firing of the CDC director, the canceling of mRNA research contracts, firing advisory board members, attempting to stall NIH funding, eliminating funding for I think a half a billion dollars for further mRNA research,” he said, referring to the National Institutes of Health. Tillis said he was having difficulty understanding why former CDC Director Susan Monarez, whom Trump nominated in March and the Senate voted to confirm in late July, had been fired so quickly. “I don't see how you go … from a public health expert with unimpeachable scientific credentials, a long-time champion of MAHA values, caring and compassionate and brilliant microbiologist — and four weeks later, fire her,” Tillis said. CDC shooting, Monarez firing probedGeorgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock questioned Kennedy at length over the firing of Monarez as well as a shooting at the Atlanta-based agency this summer. Kennedy testified that he doesn’t believe he criticized Monarez during a meeting in late August over her comments following the CDC shooting that “misinformation can be dangerous.”During that meeting, Kennedy said he did demand that Monarez fire career CDC scientists but testified he didn’t tell her to accept the recommendations of the vaccine advisory panel without further review.""What I asked her about is, she had made a statement that she was going to not sign on and I wanted clarification about that,"" Kennedy said. “I told her I didn’t want her to have a role if she’s not going to sign onto it.”Monarez wrote in an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal just hours before the hearing began that during the meeting with Kennedy she “was told to preapprove the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel newly filled with people who have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric.”“That panel’s next meeting is scheduled for Sept. 18-19,” Monarez wrote. “It is imperative that the panel’s recommendations aren’t rubber-stamped but instead are rigorously and scientifically reviewed before being accepted or rejected.”Warnock asked Kennedy if he said that the CDC was the “most corrupt federal agency in the history of the world.” Kennedy testified he didn’t say that exactly but did say “it’s the most corrupt agency at HHS and maybe the government.” Warnock concluded his five minutes of questions telling Kennedy that “it’s clear you’re carrying out your extremist beliefs” and that he represents “a threat to the public health of the American people.”“For the first time, we're seeing deaths from children from measles,” Warnock said. “We haven't seen that in two decades. We're seeing that under your watch. You are a hazard to the health of the American people.”Lankford, Daines ask about medication abortionSeveral senators, including Oklahoma Republican James Lankford and Montana Republican Steve Daines, asked Kennedy about the ongoing review of mifepristone, one of two prescription pharmaceuticals used in medication abortion. Kennedy said he spoke with FDA Commissioner Marty Makary about the topic just yesterday and committed to keeping senators informed, but didn’t appear to know much more than that. “I don't know if they're going to do an insurance claim study. That's one way to do it. I don't know exactly whether they're doing epidemiological studies or observational studies. I don't know exactly what they're doing,” Kennedy said. “But I know I talked to Marty Makary about it yesterday, and he said those studies are progressing and that they're ongoing. So I will keep your office informed at every stage.”Kennedy testified that he didn’t know when exactly the studies would be completed. The FDA first approved mifepristone in 2000 before updating the prescribing guidelines in 2016 and during the coronavirus pandemic. It’s currently approved for up to 10 weeks gestation and can be prescribed via telehealth and shipped to patients. Mifepristone is the first pharmaceutical of medication abortion and is typically followed by misoprostol. Medication abortion accounted for about 64% of all abortions in 2023, according to research from the Guttmacher Institute. The Supreme Court rejected an effort to limit access to medication abortion last year in a case originally filed by four anti-abortion medical organizations and four anti-abortion doctors that were represented by Alliance Defending Freedom.Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the opinion that “federal conscience laws have protected pro-life doctors ever since FDA approved mifepristone in 2000.”Numerous medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, wrote briefs to the Supreme Court in that case attesting to the safety and efficacy of mifepristone. “The scientific evidence is overwhelming: major adverse events occur in less than 0.32% of patients,” the medical organizations wrote. “The risk of death is almost non-existent.”",,,,2025-09-04 16:57:20.235246

(Photo collage by Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for an outside attorney hired by the state prison oversight board to continue representing it in its lawsuit over who controls the Department of Corrections’ highest-ranking officials.
The high court affirmed its previous decision to dismiss a motion by Attorney General Tim Griffin’s office to disqualify the attorney hired by the Arkansas Board of Corrections in 2023 and rejected his petition to reconsider the June decision.
Griffin’s motion to disqualify the board’s outside counsel was part of a broader appeal to dismiss the corrections board’s lawsuit. In an opinion authored by Chief Justice Karen Baker in June, a court majority rejected the attorney general’s request to overturn a lower court’s preliminary injunction and dismiss the lawsuit and ordered the trial court to proceed with the case. In that opinion, the justices said the motion to disqualify Abtin Mehdizadegan and the Hall Booth Smith law firm was outside the scope of their review.
Arkansas Corrections Board lawsuit against governor stays alive with Supreme Court ruling 

A denial of a motion to disqualify one’s legal counsel, Baker wrote at the time, was “not an appealable final order.”
Griffin’s office subsequently asked the court to reconsider, arguing that the decision “risks undermining the Court’s inherent power to regulate the practice of law before it.” Griffin said that rather than asking the court to review a lower court’s decision to deny the disqualification motion, he had asked the justices to disqualify the attorney from representing the board before the Supreme Court itself.
“A disqualification motion before an appellate court addresses a distinct issue from a disqualification motion before the trial court,” Griffin’s petition for a rehearing said. “The Court therefore has inherent authority to rule on Appellants’ motion to disqualify the Board’s illegally retained appellate counsel and determine whether they were properly before this Court.”
The Supreme Court did not give a reason in Thursday’s one-page per curiam order for not rehearing the matter, nor were there any noted dissents. The court’s affirmation of the circuit court’s decision noted Justice Shawn Womack dissented, and Justice Barbara Webb concurred and dissented in part. Justices Cody Hiland and Nicholas Bronni did not participate.
The move from the Supreme Court is the latest entry in the almost two-year legal battle between the Board of Corrections and Griffin and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders over who ultimately controls the Department of Corrections’ (DOC) highest-ranking officials.
The fight began with growing tensions between the board and former Corrections Secretary Joe Profiri in November 2023 over Sanders’ demand that more beds be opened in the state’s prison system. The state continues to face a shortage of prison beds and staffing for those beds, which the board cited in its reasoning not to approve more beds requested by Profiri and Sanders.

Weeks later, those tensions exploded into a court fight between the board and Sanders over who ultimately has control over top-ranking corrections officials — and the extent of the board’s constitutional authority — when the board suspended Profiri after he moved to open additional beds in defiance of the board.
Profiri said after his initial suspension, however, that he would still go to work — prompting the lawsuit by the board. The board subsequently fired him, after which Sanders hired Profiri as a special adviser on corrections matters.
The dispute stems from Acts 185 and 659 of 2023, which provided that the corrections department secretary serve at the pleasure of the governor instead of the board, while the heads of its two divisions report to the secretary — effectively removing them from board oversight, the board alleged. The board filed suit over the pair of state laws on Dec. 14, 2023, claiming they infringed on the authority granted to it under Amendment 33 of the state constitution and asking that the laws be struck down as unconstitutional.

Pulaski County Circuit Court Judge Patricia James initially sided with the board and issued a preliminary injunction in January 2024, keeping authority over the corrections officials with the board while the lawsuit played out, which cleared the way for Profiri’s firing.
Griffin appealed, asking the Supreme Court to vacate the injunction and dismiss the case as moot in light of Profiri’s firing, as well as find that the board’s outside counsel was hired illegally.
Griffin argued that the attorney was hired illegally by the board, but James ruled that the board was considered a constitutional officer under the state constitution, therefore allowing them to hire outside counsel.
With the affirmation of the June ruling, the case awaits a final ruling from the circuit court.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-04 20:05:32+00:00,CT Mirror,Democrat lawmakers ask CT judicial branch to ban ICE arrests at courthouses,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/04/ct-ice-arrests-courthouse/,Senate Democrats asked CT Chief Justice Raheem Mullins to ban ICE from arresting people anywhere where judicial proceedings are taking place.,"A group of state lawmakers is calling on Connecticut’s Chief Justice to issue an order banning U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from arresting or detaining people in the state’s courthouses. 
A group of 21 Democratic Senators, including Sen. Martin Looney, D-New Haven, the Senate Majority Leader, and Sen. Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, the Deputy Majority Leader, sent a letter on Wednesday to Chief Justice Raheem Mullins asking for tighter protections
Specifically, they asked that Mullins issue an order similar to one the United States District Courts in Connecticut issued in early August banning federal immigration officers from arresting people anywhere in courthouses where judicial proceedings are taking place. 
The Senators said their request came in light of an arrest in Stamford on August 11, where three ICE agents entered the courthouse without a warrant and arrested two men hiding in the bathroom, according to the letter. They referenced similar arrests in Danbury. 
“Prior to recent incidents at the courthouses in Stamford and Danbury, ICE agents only apprehended individuals outside courthouses, a practice common since the Oval Office changed hands in January of 2025. Now, Connecticut residents cannot access the justice system without fear of potential apprehension by ICE,” the senators wrote.
They called the courthouse a “safe haven” for victims, particularly people who have been in car accidents, are in need of protective orders or who are going through a divorce. Looney told the Connecticut Mirror that people who come to courthouses could be witnesses of crime, domestic violence victims or involved in a civil case. 
Constanza Segovia, lead organizer for Hartford Deportation Defense, said her organization had been pressing for restrictions on federal immigration enforcement in courtrooms since 2016. 
“In our community, in our membership, we constantly hear from people who are concerned about appearing in court for basic court appearances that just feel risky and should have nothing to do with immigration status,” she told CT Mirror. 
She said that while the organization generally encourages people to comply with court orders in order to avoid a higher level offense that could impact their immigration status, the recent federal activity has left her uncertain whether to continue offering that advice without protection from the state. 
Data from the Deportation Data Project shows that arrests in Connecticut by federal immigration enforcement in the first half of 2025 are more than double what they were in the first half of 2024. Deportations have tripled. 
On Aug. 20, ICE’s Boston Office announced the completion of what they called “Operation Broken Trust,” a four-day operation in which they arrested 65 immigrants in Connecticut. At the time, the group Greater Danbury Unites for Immigrants said in a statement that federal agents had been seen at the Danbury courthouse on a regular basis during ICE’s operation. 
Videos posted on social media showed confrontations between advocacy groups and ICE agents in the parking lot of Danbury Superior Court, as officials arrested a man and a woman. The videos show a group of officers dressed in tactical gear, some of whom wore masks. 
Advocates had asked that a prohibition on arrests in state courthouses be included in a bill updating the state’s Trust Act — the law that regulates how local and state law enforcement interacts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The provision did not make it into the bill. 
Rep. Greg Howard, R-Stonington, one of the top Republicans on the legislature’s Public Safety Committee, criticized the senators’ letter in a statement, saying that such a policy would prevent federal officials from arresting unauthorized immigrants who have broken the law, putting the public at risk. 
“Too often the Trust Act prevents local law enforcement from coordinating with ICE to arrange safe, controlled transfers. Instead of allowing orderly arrests in secure environments, this policy forces dangerous, transient individuals to be released on the hope they’ll return to court and avoid further crimes. Law enforcement wants to protect our communities through proper procedures, but current state policies tie their hands and put public safety at risk,” Howard said. 
State Rep. Steven Stafstrom, D-Stamford, one of the chairs of the state legislature’s Judiciary Committee, told CT Mirror that he agreed with the concerns that the Senate Democrats raised in their letter.
“There seems to be a real escalation of the hostility with which ICE is entering our courthouses, and I think we need to take a very serious look at how we can respond to that and make sure that everyone who enters our courthouses feel safe and is able to participate peacefully in the justice system,” he said. 
Stafstrom said he and his co-chair on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, plan to meet with Mullins next week.
Karen Hunter, an organizer with Greater Danbury Unites for Immigrants, one of 90 organizations that sent a letter to Gov. Ned Lamont and state lawmakers asking for protections for immigrants to be a focus during the legislative session, said that on Wednesday she’d watched the father of two small children as he was detained near the Danbury Superior Courthouse.
“If people fear deportation when going to court, they effectively lose access to the entire justice system — whether they’re victims reporting crimes, witnesses, or family members,” said Hunter.
Hunter’s group asked that, in addition to focusing on ICE presence at courthouses, lawmakers limit the amount of personal data shared between state agencies and the federal government and continue to offer state health insurance to unauthorized migrant children and pregnant women.
The senators Thursday also requested that the Judicial Branch install additional measures, including limiting information posted online about court dates, allowing for electronic court appearances, requiring federal agents to provide courthouse security officers with names and badge numbers, and barring face coverings inside courthouses.
Chief Justice Mullins said in a statement that he is “committed to making sure our courthouses are safe spaces of fairness and protection for all who use them,” and that the Judicial Branch “will employ all legally supported methods to do so.”
Other states have proposed bans on courthouse arrests. Massachusetts in 2019 placed a ban on arrests by federal immigration enforcement agents in courthouses. The ban was later overturned by an appeals court. And the Trump Administration this June filed a lawsuit against the state of New York challenging a 2020 law blocking federal immigration authorities from arresting people in state courthouses without a warrant. 
In July, a group of organizations advocating for immigrants filed a class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the Department of Justice in protest of several changes in federal immigration policy, including civil arrests in courthouses. 
Looney said he didn’t know the likelihood of a ban on courthouse arrests in Connecticut being challenged, but he said he believed the state should have a plan and that it should look to the examples of other states. He said that while the state can’t “interfere” with federal immigration enforcement, there were still protocols that could be enforced. 
He said the three branches of government needed to work together to address the problem, and that he would be open to discussing legislation at a special session.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/B22A9544-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-04 16:57:20.235246

The North Carolina State Board of Education on Thursday ordered a full financial review of Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools and set a 0.4% monthly interest rate on the district’s $3.4 million debt to the state.
The move followed weeks of scrutiny after a state audit revealed widespread financial mismanagement. The district has been navigating a $46 million budget deficit, triggering mass layoffs and drawing criticism from the community and some state board members.
The state board will hire an outside firm to review the district’s overall financial management.
Audit reveals deeper issues
A state audit report released last month found that the district used temporary federal COVID-19 funds to cover permanent salaries, approved purchase orders without money in the budget, and delayed routine account reconciliations. Auditors also flagged misuse of “suspense accounts,” temporary accounts where money is held until it can be properly assigned. At one point, they held more than $332 million, and the funds weren’t tracked clearly.
The audit found no fraud but detailed years of financial mismanagement and weak oversight.
“The situation was a perfect financial storm,” Dionne Tunstall Jenkins, the general counsel at Winston-Salem Forsyth County Schools, told state board officials during an appeal hearing on Tuesday on the debt owed to the state.
While the appeal committee recommended extending the grace period for interest on the district’s $3.4 million debt to the N.C. Department of Public Instruction until Nov. 20, 2025, the full board on Thursday rejected the committee’s recommendation to waive interest entirely and instead approved a 0.4% monthly rate, proposed by State Treasurer Brad Briner. “There’s no such thing as free money,” Briner said. The motion passed 5-4.
Still, without the reprieve, the debt would have accrued a 1% monthly penalty, costing the district more than $900,000 over a year. The debt is part of a larger $11.3 million overdraft of state funds that the district racked up during the 2024-25 school year. The district has already repaid roughly $8 million.
Sharp criticism from state leaders
During Thursday’s meeting, board member Olivia Holmes Oxendine sharply criticized Forsyth’s leadership.
“I was appalled in reading the eight findings clearly worded,” Oxendine said. “They need to rethink if they really are in the seat they need to be in.”
“The report needs to be a case study of how not to govern the resources provided by this great state,” she said. “I do not sense that the board gave consideration to protecting the resources of the taxpayers of Forsyth County.”
She said the district’s leadership must rebuild its reputation from the ground up. She also said the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County School Board Members should, “Donate their monthly stipend to help pay off this bill at a minimum.”
Interim Superintendent Catty Moore, who took over in June, has overseen two rounds of staff reductions totaling more than 470 positions, including assistant principals, support staff and employees in the Exceptional Children’s program, she said during the appeal hearing on Tuesday. The cuts, aimed at saving more than $60 million, have drawn protests from teachers, students and parents who warned that the reductions would dismantle essential services. Moore, a state board member, recused herself from Thursday’s vote.
Looking ahead, Moore has promised more transparency, sending monthly budget reports to the district’s board members and working with consultants to align staffing with enrollment, she said during the appeal hearing Tuesday.
While acknowledging what he called “difficult decisions,” State Board Chair Eric Davis said the actions taken Thursday were necessary to help the district recover from its budget crisis. “Our goal is to return the district to a healthy financial position,” Davis said. “That is our objective.”

The Democratic governors of California, Oregon and Washington said Wednesday they are forming an alliance to coordinate vaccine recommendations for their states.
Meanwhile, Florida announced plans to become the first state to phase out all vaccine mandates, including ending requirements that kids be vaccinated against dangerous diseases before enrolling in schools.
Public health experts have relied on vaccines, including school mandates, for decades to limit the spread of communicable diseases and keep kids and adults safe.

The contrasting moves come amid turmoil at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where several top leaders resigned last week to protest efforts by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
Accompanied by Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, state Surgeon General Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo said at a news conference Wednesday that vaccine mandates are “wrong” and “immoral,” the Florida Phoenix reported.
“Your body is a gift from God. What you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and your God,” Ladapo said.
“They do not have the right to tell you what you put in your body. They don’t have the right to tell you what your kids have to put in [their] body. They do not have the right. Do not give it to them. Take it away from them. And we’re going to be starting that here in Florida.”

The Florida Department of Health can eliminate some vaccine mandates on its own, Ladapo said, but the Florida legislature would have to scrap other ones. He did not mention specific vaccines, but repeated that his goal was to end “all of them. Every last one of them.”
“Every last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,” Ladapo said.
The goal of the new West Coast Health Alliance, governors said, is to disseminate evidence-based recommendations about who should get immunized, as well as to provide vaccine education throughout the three states. In the coming weeks, the states will coordinate and finalize immunization guidelines that are in line with leading medical organizations.
In their announcements, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek and Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson criticized recent Trump administration actions, including the firing of scientists and the upheaval at the CDC.
“When federal agencies abandon evidence-based recommendations in favor of ideology, we cannot continue down that same path,” Washington Secretary of Health Dennis Worsham said in a statement.
Worsham added that “public health at its core is about prevention — preventing illness, preventing the spread of disease, and preventing early, avoidable deaths.”
Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states rely on the committee to form vaccination guidelines.
And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for children and pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19 — sidestepping the usual process for issuing official recommendations.

The three Western states said the “dismantling” of the CDC has created “a vacuum of clear, evidence-based vaccine guidance,” hampering health care providers, disrupting manufacturers’ production plans and creating uncertainty for families.
In 2020, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the three states, along with Nevada, created a similar workgroup that emphasized the scientific rigor behind the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in an effort to boost confidence in the shot.
“President Donald Trump’s mass firing of CDC doctors and scientists — and his blatant politicization of the agency — is a direct assault on the health and safety of the American people,” the joint statement from the three governors’ offices said.
“The CDC has become a political tool that increasingly peddles ideology instead of science, ideology that will lead to severe health consequences. California, Oregon, and Washington will not allow the people of our states to be put at risk.”

A warming climate could bring more, according to new study",Rachel Becker,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/wildfires/2025/09/lightning-strike-wildfire-2025-science/,"When lightning strikes are abundant, so are wildfires – some in remote places across the state. Scientists warn there may be more in the future.","In summary
When lightning strikes are abundant, so are wildfires – some in remote places across the state. Scientists warn there may be more in the future. 


As dozens of wildfires burn across California after a remarkable outbreak of dry lightning, a new study warns that a warming planet could bring more lightning-sparked wildfires to the West in the coming decades. 
“These are the sort of events that can really allow the fire season to turn on a dime,” said John Abatzoglou, a professor of climatology at UC Merced and an author of the study.
From early Tuesday into Wednesday morning, a lightning storm hurled thousands of bolts at the state, Cal Fire battalion chief David Acuña told CalMatters Wednesday. Forty-five new fires ignited within Cal Fire’s jurisdiction in that same time period, he said. Dry lightning strikes with little, if any, rainfall nearby. 
“We can’t collectively say they’re all lightning fires, but we can say that there were a large number of lightning strikes and a large number of fires,” Acuña said. 
Many of them are burning in the Sierra foothills, including the TCU September Lightning Complex in Tuolumne, Stanislaus and Calaveras Counties. Those fires have already torched nearly 14,000 acres, forced evacuations, destroyed buildings and devastated the historic Gold Rush town of Chinese Camp. 
Exactly how many lightning strikes hit the ground Tuesday and Wednesday is hard to count. But Chris Vagasky, lightning data specialist with the national lightning safety council, calculates nearly 11,000 bolts of electricity struck the ground in California over 31 hours. Federal maps show dry lightning up and down the center of California, from below Fresno to the Oregon border. 
Though people spark the vast majority of wildfires, lightning strikes have caused some of California’s biggest and longest-lasting blazes — accounting for more than a third of the area burned in California in recent decades, according to Abatzoglou’s analysis of federal data. 
Lightning started some of the biggest wildfires in California history, including 2020’s August Complex, which killed a firefighter and became the first fire on record to burn more than a million acres of the state. 
These rogue, lightning-sparked fires are the “dominant driver” behind how much of the West burns, Abatzoglou said — which is why scientists seek to understand their patterns. 
His team’s study, published last week in the journal Earth’s Future, reports that from 2030 to 2060, some western states could see up to 12 more days of lightning striking the ground per year.
Using machine learning, the researchers found that eastern Oregon and Washington, Idaho and western Montana will see some of the largest increases. But parts of northeast California and the eastern Sierra could see an increase as well. 
Parts of the southwest saw more mixed results. But even there, as climate change drives hotter, drier conditions, the researchers found that lightning is increasingly likely to strike when parched lands are more vulnerable to fire. 
“You get this very hazardous situation in terms of fire risk, where you have lighting that hits the dry vegetation,” postdoctoral scientist Dmitri Kalashnikov, the study’s lead author, said. “You’ll get an ignition, but then there’s no downpours to extinguish the flame — so that fire can grow.”
UC Merced’s new study bolsters earlier predictions that climate change could spur more lightning strikes. 
But Vagasky, who did not participate in the research, says it improves on previous efforts by focusing on the risk for lightning-sparked fire across places with different geographies, weather patterns and vegetation. 
“It’s not always the amount of lightning,” Vagasky said. “It’s the one lightning stroke that hits in the wrong place, at the wrong time, that starts the fire.” 
‘We have to be ready’
Under the right conditions and in the right places, lightning fires can act like prescribed burns and clear away fuels, said Zeke Lunder, a pyrogeographer and director at The Lookout, a wildfire education blog and YouTube channel. 
The challenge is when a bout of dry lightning sparks dozens of fires, all at once. 
“We’re really good at putting out fires,” Lunder said. “But when we have a hundred, a few of them are going to get away.” 
Five years ago, Cal Fire’s Acuña was mopping up the lightning-sparked Hills Fire near Coalinga when another lightning storm descended. 
“Lightning was striking all around us, and we were just so exhausted that we were like, ‘Well, there’s nowhere to hide,’” he said. “There’s no cave. You can’t stand under a tree. We just got as flat as we could, and waited for it to pass over.” 
He remembers it felt like hours, lying there waiting for the storm to pass. “There was a charge in every one of my cells from, you know, being concerned,” he said.  
Such fires are also insidious, capable of smoldering in remote areas until hot, dry, windy conditions coax them into an inferno. 
“They’re difficult to discover,” Acuña said. “They could be sitting inside the root of a struck oak tree for a week, week-and-a-half — and then all of a sudden, there’s a fire.” 
The state is taking steps to better detect fires, Acuña added — even unpredictable and sneaky ones sparked by lightning. In 2023, Cal Fire partnered with UC San Diego’s ALERTCalifornia, which uses a network of more than 1,100 cameras and artificial intelligence to alert firefighters about potential fires.
“We have to be ready, because there was little to no notice that this lightning was coming in,” Acuña said. “If it happened once, it can happen again. And so we maintain readiness to respond anywhere within the state to protect people, property and resources.”
UC Merced’s Kalashnikov says he has not yet seen a climate-fueled increase in lightning — but that it’s not a distant threat.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The University of Northern Iowa is leading a study into materials that could be applied to quantum technologies as part of a more than $1 million grant with partner universities.
UNI announced in a news release the university will receive $340,000 of the overall grant, other portions of which were awarded to South Dakota State University and the University of Virginia, to study advanced materials with different magnetic qualities. The grant comes from the National Science Foundation, or NSF.
Pavel Lukashev, a physicist and professor at UNI, will serve as principal investigator for the project, with UNI Physics Department Head Paul Shand working as his co-principal investigator.

“NSF research grants are extremely competitive, especially for institutions that are not major research centers,” Lukashev said in the release. “Our work combines experimental and theoretical approaches to advance quantum science with a focus on novel magnetic compounds, while also giving UNI students hands-on experience at the forefront of research.”
The research will focus on “topological magnetic materials,” according to the release, specifically Heusler alloys, which were described as “metal mixtures that are relatively easy to make and adjust for different magnetic properties.”
These materials, as well as other components that have uncommon magnetic patterns, will be analyzed by researchers to see if they could potentially become base components of future technologies — like quantum computing or advanced data storage.
Students will also have the chance to participate in research for the project, the release stated, as well as the publication and presentation of the work.
“The materials we study offer an exciting platform for discovering new topologically protected phases,” Shand said in the release. “This award highlights UNI’s strength in physics and our ability to contribute meaningfully to national research priorities.”

The order, signed by Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment director Jill Hunsaker Ryan, criticizes the “confusion and uncertainty” caused by the Food and Drug Administration’s Aug. 27 move to restrict access to the latest COVID-19 vaccines to those aged 65 or older or at higher risk of severe disease. The CDPHE order directs multiple state agencies to take steps to maintain broad access to vaccination, including by requiring insurers to cover the vaccines and instructing pharmacists to provide them without a doctor’s prescription.
“I’m taking action to ensure that Coloradans who want to can easily and conveniently get the safe and effective updated COVID vaccine, along with the flu vaccine, this fall without having to go to a doctor first,” Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. “Starting this Friday, the COVID-19 vaccine should be available to those who choose at many local pharmacies.”

More than 4,500 Coloradans have been hospitalized due to COVID-19 over the last 11 months, CDPHE officials said.
Pursuant to the CDPHE directive, Colorado’s chief medical officer, Dr. Ned Calonge, issued a standing order that will “serve as a prescription for eligible Coloradans to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.” Those eligible include anyone between the ages of 5 and 64 who “desire their protection from COVID-19” and young children “whose parent or guardian desires their protection from COVID-19,” even if they do not belong to a high-risk group.
That significantly expands the eligibility limits set by the FDA’s Aug. 27 approval of four new vaccine formulations, which were directed by top Trump administration officials over the objections of agency scientists, The New York Times reported. The move comes amid a broad assault on the federal public health establishment led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spent decades spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories about vaccines and other health issues.
Amid the unprecedented upheaval at federal health agencies — including the recent resignations of four senior officials at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the firing of the agency’s director — the states of California, Oregon and Washington announced this week that they will form a “health alliance” to make recommendations on vaccines. A group of northeastern states are considering a similar move.
Polis has faced criticism for his own history of opposition to vaccine mandates, and for voicing his support last year for Kennedy’s appointment to lead HHS. But he called the administration’s new vaccine limits “ridiculous.”
“These effective vaccines are available at many local pharmacies and supermarkets, and I encourage my fellow Coloradans to join me in getting protected,” Polis said. “Colorado is committed to empowering individuals to make choices to protect their own health and safety.”
The State Board of Pharmacy will convene an emergency meeting Friday to consider draft rules formalizing the requirements in CDPHE’s order.

The science conducted at Wax Lake informed coastal restoration projects such as the now canceled Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)One of the key scientists involved in a now-defunct plan to rebuild coastal wetlands in southeast Louisiana has a new approach for how to take on the task. 
Ehab Meselhe, a coastal restoration scientist and professor at Tulane University, is researching a new way to operate the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion he says could be a compromise to move the project forward. But whether officials who control coastal restoration are willing to accept his idea is more uncertain than the science behind it.
The concept uses the bones of the previous large-scale sediment diversion, mimicking the natural processes that originally created the delta region at the mouth of the Mississippi River. The power of the river’s current slowly feeds layers of sediment to build new marshland along Louisiana’s coast.
But instead of keeping the flow of water constant, Meselhe is exploring a way to periodically turn off the faucet.
 His research has yet to be published, meaning it hasn’t undergone academic scrutiny. But it does draw from previous bodies of knowledge.  
“We started to think about exploring the concept of pulsing,” Meselhe said, along with piling dredged sand by the mouth of the floodgate that controls flow from the Mississippi River. When opened, the sediment and sand would be carried into Barataria Bay, helping build land in coastal Jefferson, Lafourche and Plaquemines parishes.
His idea would likely involve less of the river’s flow from the original plans, which Meselhe said would result in less land being built but far less dilution in the salinity of the bay’s water. The chief complaint among opponents of the diversion is its potential impact on the estuary, its sealife and the livelihoods it supports. Oyster farmers, in particular, have said their beds in the area would perish.  
Meselhe’s idea combines the pulsing concept with the idea to transport dredge material into the outflow area, which draws off previous scientific experiments to create sand or mud “engines.” 
A plusing diversion has been studied before, said Sam Bentley, professor and chair of LSU’s geology and geophysics department, as well as co-director of the coastal restoration research group MissDelta Consortium. 
The Netherlands and river systems in southeast Asia have used the sand engine concept successfully, Bentley said, but Meselhe’s plan would combine elements in a brand new fashion in North America. 
“The idea of engineering shorelines so that sediment is redistributed naturally by existing currents is something that’s been around for several decades,” Bentley said, “But Ehab’s design concept is unique, it’s exciting … and I think has great potential.”
The state official in charge of coastal restoration says “it ain’t gonna work.”
“Hats off to everyone who has an idea,” said Gordon “Gordy” Dove, chairman of the Louisiana Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority.  While explaining that he doesn’t mean to be “patronizing,” he said he doesn’t believe in further experimentation over traditional restoration land-building methods such as “dredging, dredging, dredging” or a smaller-scale diversion higher up in the basin. 
“My job is to protect the coast, and we don’t have much time. That’s why I believe in trying what’s worked in the past,” Dove said. 
Meselhe, Bentley and other scientists say dredging alone won’t be the solution Louisiana’s coast needs. 
“I think that we are at an inflection point in time right now where we have to find new solutions. We can’t rely on conventional engineering, you know, old old school solutions,” Bentley said, adding that dredging could be done in conjunction with other methods.
Scientists also see problems with relying only on a small-scale diversion for the Barataria Basin, saying it will still pour considerable freshwater into the bay. Meselhe’s computer models of different diversion projects in the region show that — even with much less water moving than the 75,000 cubic feet per second that Mid-Barataria called for — they still push salt water further away from the shore. 
“Whether it’s Mid-Breton or Mid-Barataria, or even some of the work that we have done on Caernarvon and Davis Pond, salinity has always been a challenge,” Meselhe said. 
“Unfortunately, changing the salinities within the basin doesn’t require that much fresh water input. It can really change pretty easily,” said Alisha Renfro, a coastal scientist with the National Wildlife Federation.
James Karst, communications director for the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, said he thinks an idea like Meselhe’s could bode well for a compromise. 
“Clearly, Mid-Barataria is no longer, and yet the crisis still exists,” Karst said. “We need to do something, and we need to do something urgently. It has to be something big.”
Some critics of the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion are open to Meselhe’s alternative. 
Mitch Jurisich, chairman of Louisiana’s Oyster Task Force, said if the research proves to be fruitful, he thinks the oyster industry will rally around a compromise. 
“We want to see land building,” he said. “Fresh water diversions can be used very beneficially to not only enhance the environment but to help the fisheries, if controlled.”
But even if enough people agree Meselhe’s idea has merit, there could be problems with moving it from theory into reality. 
“How feasible is it really to do that?” Renfro said. “What’s going to be the cost of the dredging and augmenting, like putting sediment into the diversion channel? Is that going to be a cost that increases over time?” 
Cost and promptness are critical, experts said. Meselhe’s previous research shows that, as more time passes, it will be harder to rebuild land within the Barataria Basin. 
“I am hoping that, because we are building on a concept that has been thoroughly reviewed, we can cut down on the time,” Meselhe said. “But I don’t know, does that mean months, or does it mean years? I don’t know, but I’m hoping that it’s not 10 years.”
“It’s totally within the realm of feasibility,” Bentley said. “You just have to get the right people at the table to do it, including state and federal government.”
“Not doing any restoration in the area is not an option,” Renfro said. “It comes down to funding, and it comes down to political will to actually restore the coast in a way that addresses the scale of land loss that we have.”
Jurisich believes that with more community engagement, compromise is possible for river diversions, even with tensions still high after fighting for so long over the original Mid-Barataria plans. 
“It doesn’t have to be one side or the other,” he said. “I think they should be engaging with communities, talking with the fishermen, especially generational fishermen” more than what officials did for the original diversion proposal. 
Meselhe said that while his research is still in its infancy, the early results are promising.
“There is nothing that you can implement in the landscape that has zero impacts, zero negative impact. That doesn’t exist. So we have to come to grips with that,” Meselhe said. “But if the negative impacts are a lot smaller, perhaps it can be palatable to the local communities and to the fishing community and to the parish residents.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4020-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-04 15:57:30.506471

(Photo by Greg Childress/NC Newsline)At a press conference in Raleigh on Thursday, Luis Alonso Juárez, a popular Duke University bus driver at risk of losing his protected immigration status, told supporters and lawmakers that he’s concerned about his safety if he’s forced to return to his native Honduras.
Juárez and as many 50 supporters, many of them Duke students, rode a chartered bus to Raleigh, first stopping by U.S. Sen. Ted Budd’s (R-NC) office on Fayetteville Street to deliver a letter requesting support before marching to the legislature to drop off letters at the offices of House Speaker Destin Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger, both Republicans. Neither were available to meet with Juárez.
“Sometimes, you’re like scared over there [Honduras],” Juárez said during a press conference at the Legislative Building, explaining that he’s heard stories about dangerous criminal organizations from others who have traveled to the country.

Juárez was granted Temporary Protected Status in 1998, according to Siembra NC, an immigrant advocacy group. That status will expire Sept. 8 because of a Trump administration order terminating TPS protection for Honduras.
Because Juárez entered the U.S. without inspection or authorization and is not married to a U.S. citizen, under current immigration law he does not qualify for another form of protection like a work visa or green card. Without protected status, Juárez and as many as 51,000 other Hondurans across the U.S. will be eligible for removal.
Immigration attorneys have advised Juárez that his only short-term path to retain a work permit would be for the Trump administration to grant an extension of protection from removal, much like it did in his first term. In 2021, President Donald Trump issued a Deferred Enforced Departure designation for Venezuelans present in the U.S. on or before Jan. 20, 2021, which granted them 18 months of deferred removal and employment authorization. He has twice extended such protections for Liberians.
Juárez and others losing their protected status are also concerned about losing their jobs on Monday when the Trump administration order takes hold.
“I’m asking Sen. Ted Budd, Sen. Phil Berger and Rep. Destin Hall to call the president to make possible that I can keep my job as a driver at Duke, and helping students learn,” Juárez said through an interpreter.

Nikki Marin Baena, co-director at Siembra NC, said there are tens of thousands of workers like Juárez who make North Carolina one of the best states in the nation for doing business.
“Luis [Juárez] has done nothing wrong that would change his immigration status,” Baena said. “And still, like so many others, he is about to have no legal protections after two decades of working for our state’s second largest employer, simply because one person in Washington decided that immigrant workers are expendable.”
Baena said that Berger, Budd and Hall have all touted North Carolina as the best state in which to do business. She noted that Budd has argued in Washington that highly skilled immigrants are essential to the nation’s success.
“Use your influence with the president,” Baena said. “Say the same thing to him that you have told North Carolina, that workers who show up day after day to make this state run are not expendable, they are the reason North Carolina is thriving, and workers like Luis [Juárez] deserve to stay.”
Thursday’s press conference was hosted by state Rep. Marcia Morey, D-Durham.
“Is Durham going to be the next city that has the National Guard brought in by the president?” Morey asked. “Are we going to be the next city with ICE officers grabbing people like Luis [Juárez] because of their immigration status?”
Rep. Maria Cervania, D-Wake, said immigrants such as Juárez are the “foundation” of the state and nation.
“He probably didn’t want to leave a country that he was born in, had dreams in, but he came here to be free, to get a better life and actually make a better life for all of us too,” Cervania said.

Michael Ramos, a Duke senior from California, said Juárez has become family.
“My mom works as a custodian at a university back home in California, and so, seeing Luis and other workers around campus instantly connects me to my home,” Ramos said, growing emotional.
After 30 years of living and working in the Durham community, Ramos said Juárez deserves to remain in the country.
“Duke would not be the same without Luis [Juárez],  Ramos said. “Let’s be honest, and I would not be the same without him either.”
Ramos announced that a fund is being started to help Juárez replace income he’s expected to lose starting Monday if he’s let go by Duke.
Juárez has become a popular figure on the Duke campus. He was profiled in the Duke Chronicle in February. And last month, 477 students, faculty and staff submitted letters of support for Juárez to Duke Visa Services, asking the university to take action on his behalf.
Juárez is well-known across Duke’s campus with students calling his the “party bus” because of the music he blasts. His many supporters say he has brought joy to their lives by playing lively music on his route.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)A Rogers public school that recently reopened after being damaged by severe weather last year received a $20,000 grant Thursday to restock the library’s Spanish-language books lost in the storm. 
Greer Lingle Middle School sustained around $18 million in damage following fatal storms that spawned multiple tornadoes across north Arkansas during the 2024 Memorial Day weekend, according to Jason Ivester, communications director for the Rogers School District. Students were relocated to temporary classroom trailers on another campus for the 2024-2025 academic year before being welcomed back to the renovated campus in August. 
Most of the district’s buildings had debris around them and no power immediately following the storm, Ivester told the Advocate last year. The schools that took the most damage were Northside Elementary, Westside Elementary and Lingle, he said. The disaster had a “damaging impact” on students and their families, but adversity pulls people together, Lingle principal Erik Sokol said.
“I would never want to go through it again, but I have a different level of gratitude and appreciation for our students and their families and our community and what we’ve been able to persevere through, and we had an outstanding year,” Sokol said.

Library Media Specialist Tara Herbert accepted a $20,000 Beyond Words grant from Dollar General representatives Tuesday that she said will support the library’s popular graphic novel section and replenish its collection of Spanish-language books. The middle school, which has nearly 700 students in grades 6 through 8, has a large Spanish-speaking population, she said. 
Herbert, who’s starting her 19th year as the school’s librarian, said it was devastating to see the storm damage for the first time. 
“I’ve spent a lot of years and a lot of time building this space up and so it was heartbreaking to see all the things that I had created throughout the years gone,” she said. “It’s kind of exciting now because it’s like a blank slate in here and we’re starting new and can do things in a different new way.”
The grant is important to rebuilding the library’s collection because without it, Herbert said she would only work within her regular budget. The school is awaiting reimbursement from its insurance company, which will inform how much money may be awarded from FEMA, Ivester said. The expenses for the renovation have been temporarily covered by using money from a building fund, he said. 
Increased frequency in natural disasters like the 2024 storms have led to increased insurance premiums for schools across the country. Ivester confirmed that the district’s premiums increased “quite considerably” for the current year, but said it was not due to the tornado.
Arkansas lawmakers give initial approval to new state insurance captive’s rate structure 

A tornado that destroyed Wynne High School in March 2023 resulted in $122 million of the more than $147 million losses in the insurance program managed by the Arkansas School Boards Association, the largest loss of any school district in Arkansas history.
In July of 2023, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced the state would help school districts cover the cost of rising insurance premiums. State lawmakers approved about $11 million to offset the cost of increased premiums, which were expected to rise about 130%.
They also hired a consultant to study increasing premiums. The result of the study was a recommendation for the state to create its own insurance captive to insure schools. Legislators approved laws earlier this year to help get the state-run insurance company set up.  
The Rogers School District was notified by the state that it’s premium for the 2025-2026 fiscal year would remain the same, about $1.97 million, and its deductible would double from $25,000 to $50,000, Ivester said.
Meanwhile, renovations are ongoing at Greer Lingle Middle School, which is getting a new storm safe room that will be part of the fine arts building. The project is expected to be completed in November, when Ivester said the school will host an official grand opening.

Office of Early Childhood Commissioner Beth Bye will retire from state service next month to pursue a Master of Social Work and a new career working with children and families in health care, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Thursday. She’ll be succeeded by Deputy Commissioner Elena Trueworthy on an interim basis, and Lamont said he plans to recommend Trueworthy for the position permanently.
With Bye’s departure, the Office of Early Childhood will become the third agency that oversees children’s welfare to have an interim leader. The Office of the Child Advocate and the Department of Children and Families both have interim leaders.
Former DCF Commissioner Jodi Hill-Lilly left the agency on Monday. Lamont named Susan Hamilton, general counsel and a former DCF commissioner, to lead the agency on an interim basis the following day. And Child Advocate Christina Ghio has been leading that office on an interim basis since Sarah Eagan’s departure from the role last September.
Bye started at OEC in 2019, at the start of Lamont’s first term. She has been at the helm at the agency during a time when a lack of early care and education workers has caused a dearth of child care across the state.
She worked with Lamont’s office to develop a plan to create the transformative Early Childhood Education Endowment fund and expand access to child care for thousands of families. Her focus has been on high-quality early care and education, which helps children’s development during an important time for brain growth.
Depending on surplus funds available and how quickly the fund grows, it aims to eventually allow families making less than $100,000 to pay nothing for infant and toddler care and pre-K, while families making more than that would pay no more than 7% of their annual household income. In partnership with Bye, the legislature also passed a measure to increase salaries for child care workers.
“Beth Bye is one of the most caring, compassionate, and energetic people that I know, and her passion for the development and wellness of the youngest members of our communities knows no bounds,” Lamont said in a press release.
In the release, Bye called her work as commissioner “the honor of my career.”
“The achievements Connecticut has made to improve the wages of early educators and make child care more affordable for families happened only because of decades of work by advocates, legislators, philanthropy, and families,” Bye said. “This collaborative work is a model for other states and the nation.”
She also praised Trueworthy in her statement, saying she had been a key leader in the past years.
“She has the vision, leadership, experience and passion to lead OEC into the future. There is nobody better to continue this critical work,” Bye said.
Trueworthy has been with the OEC since 2019. She’s served as the director of the Head Start State Collaboration Office and was appointed deputy commissioner in 2023.
“I look forward to continuing to work closely with partners, providers, and families to build upon and implement the collective vision of an early childhood system that supports children and families to thrive,” Trueworthy said.
Lamont said her experience would allow her to “hit the ground running.”
Trueworthy has a bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of Connecticut and a master’s degree in human services from Springfield College. Lamont said he plans to submit her name as the candidate for the next commissioner to the legislature in the upcoming session, which begins early next year.
In issued statements, lawmakers and leaders in early childhood care and education congratulated Bye on her work with the agency.
Garth Harries, president and chief executive officer of The Connecticut Project Action Fund, said Bye had been a “relentless champion of Connecticut’s children and working families during her time in office.”
Children’s Committee co-chair Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton, wished Bye well in her next role.
“Connecticut’s children are losing a great advocate and leader today, one who was always laser-focused on supporting all children in the best possible way,” Maher said. “As a natural leader who helped create the Office of Early Childhood in the legislature, she was the perfect choice to take its reins.”
Bye also served in the legislature from 2007 to 2019 as both a representative and a senator. During her time in the legislature, she was one of the leaders in the effort to establish the OEC in 2013.
“Commissioner Bye is leaving behind an incredible legacy as an advocate for young children, their families and our shared hometown of West Hartford,” said Sen. Derek Slap, D-West Hartford. “As my predecessor in the state senate and then at OEC, Commissioner Bye brought energy, compassion and forward thinking to her public service.”
As commissioner, Bye earned about $207,000 annually.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0319_SR_Hearing_292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-04 14:58:11.380802

May was arrested in June on 10 charges of sending images and videos of children being sexual abuse. He has pleaded not guilty. The founding member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus resigned his House seat last month.
A judge had previously assigned him taxpayer-funded public defenders after May said he couldn’t afford to pay an attorney of his own. May’s two public defenders can sit behind him to answer questions and clarify statements the judge makes, U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie decided.
SC representative charged with distributing child sexual abuse material

May will be responsible for making opening and closing arguments, examining and cross-examining witnesses, and filing motions from his Edgefield County jail cell.
The exact reasons for May’s decision are unclear. Issues between attorneys and clients are typically not made public.
Unlike many of his former colleagues at the Statehouse, May is not an attorney. He owns Ivory Tusk Consulting, which ran campaigns for GOP candidates who aligned with his hardline brand of conservatism.
Clients looking to fire their attorneys and represent themselves must be competent to make the decision, which was a bar May met, Currie decided.
May originally asked Currie to allow him to represent himself in filing a motion to suppress evidence but let his attorneys represent him during the trial. When Currie denied that proposal, May instead asked to proceed without attorneys representing him.
A hearing on arguments over whether a search warrant used to seize electronics from May’s house last year can be used in the trial is scheduled for Sept. 24.
Jury selection in May’s trial is set to begin Oct. 8, with arguments starting the next day. Prosecutors have said they expect the trial to last six days.
In messages and phone calls to friends and family from his jail cell obtained through an open records request, May repeatedly mentioned working on motions, including to suppress evidence and revoke his detention. He’s been held without bond since June 11.
“i finishes my suppression motion,” May wrote to an unspecified number June 22. “pretty good for a non lawyer, i think.”
May argued in some messages that prosecutors hadn’t actually found any evidence of child sexual abuse material on his devices, suggesting they had little evidence to back up their claims.
“digital forensics just dont work like that,” May wrote June 19.
An attorney representing May during his June detention hearing suggested a political enemy might have hacked into his WiFi to send images and videos.
Investigators traced an account on messaging app Kik that was flagged for sending videos of child sexual abuse to May’s home internet and personal cellphone, a special agent for the Department of Homeland Security said previously.
The account had at least 220 different videos and images depicting child sexual abuse saved. None of the images were saved directly to the phone, but that’s not uncommon in these cases, the special agent testified.
May’s phone showed Kik and other encrypted, foreign-based apps had been deleted. Data on his phone suggested that commonly used phrases included the “joebidennnn69” username linked to the flagged Kik account and an alternate email account for that user, investigators said.
If convicted, May could spend between five and 20 years in prison for each of the 10 charges he faces. He could also have to pay up to $250,000 for each count, plus additional fees that could add up to $40,000.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_0994-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-04 14:58:11.380802

(Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)After the Trump administration slashed billions in state and local public health funding from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this year, the eventual impact on states split sharply along political lines.
Democratic-led states that sued to block the cuts kept much of their funding, while Republican-led states lost the bulk of theirs, according to a new analysis from health research organization KFF.
The uneven fallout underscores how politics continues shaping health care in the United States. The nearly 700 CDC grants were worth about $11 billion and had been allocated by Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, state and local health departments had spent or planned to spend the money not just on COVID-related efforts, but also on prevention of other infectious diseases, support for mental health and substance use, shoring up aging public health infrastructure, and other needs.
The CDC grant terminations initially affected red and blue states about evenly, according to KFF. California, the District of Columbia, Illinois and Massachusetts — all led by Democrats — had among the largest numbers of terminated grants.
But then nearly two dozen blue states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration in April, asking the court to block the grant terminations. They argued the federal government lacked the authority to rescind funding it had already allocated.
“The Trump administration’s illegal and irresponsible decision to claw back life-saving health funding is an attack on the well-being of millions of Americans,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James in an April statement announcing the lawsuit.
“Slashing this funding now will reverse our progress on the opioid crisis, throw our mental health systems into chaos, and leave hospitals struggling to care for patients.”
A federal judge sided with the blue states and blocked the cancellations  — but she limited her injunction to the jurisdictions that filed in the lawsuit.
Nearly 80% of the grant cuts have now been restored in blue states, according to the KFF analysis, compared with less than 5% in red states.
Now four of the five states with the most canceled grants are led by Republicans: Georgia, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas. California, which is dominated by Democrats, kept all of its grants that had been initially terminated.
In the West and Midwest, Democratic-led Colorado — which joined the lawsuit — had 10 of its 11 grant terminations reversed. Its Republican-led neighbors that did not sue, including Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming, lost all of their grants, according to the KFF analysis.

Jay Collins participates in the extradition from California of Harjinder Singh, accused of causing an accident that killed three people in Florida. (Via Collins' X account)Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier issued subpoenas Thursday to the trucking company that employed an allegedly undocumented immigrant accused of killing three Floridians in a traffic accident.
According to the criminal subpoena, White Hawk Carriers Inc., a California company, is compelled to produce documents detailing the citizenship status of all of its licensed drivers as well as all files related to Harjinder Singh.
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier (via Department of Legal Affairs)
“We are going to be issuing both criminal and civil subpoenas against White Hawk Carriers,” Uthmeier announced during a Thursday morning press conference in Tampa. “Not only was [Singh] illegally here in the country, but he also did not have the competence, the skill set. There’s no way he went through the proper training in order to get this license.”
Singh, a 28-year-old Indian national, was issued commercial driver’s licenses in Washington state and California despite failing an English proficiency test, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. On Aug. 12, he allegedly made an illegal U-turn on the Florida Turnpike in St. Lucie County in an eighteen-wheeler, killing three in a vehicle that slammed into his rig.
Although the civil subpoena has yet to be issued, Uthmeier’s criminal summons demands White Hawk respond within 20 days. The subpoena enumerates 27 requests of the Ceres, California, company. These include details of White Hawk’s affiliates, identities of their Florida-licensed drivers, how they process and affirm commercial driver’s licence applicants, and records related to Singh’s incident.
The accident has had national ramifications, prompting Secretary of State Marco Rubio to temporarily freeze visas for foreign-born truck drivers and federal authorities to threaten slashed funding for states that don’t enforce English-proficiency standards for commercial truck drivers.
In August, DOT launched a federal investigation into White Hawk Carriers, finding that Singh had failed the mandatory English Language Proficiency assessment required for commercial truckers. Singh provided correct responses to just 2 of 12 verbal questions and only accurately identified 1 of 4 highway traffic signs, the agency said.
White Hawk has had 25 truck-safety violations in its last 24 inspections, and may have lost its ability to do business outside of California, the Miami Herald reported.
Florida on the national stage
Florida has pushed itself center-stage in the Singh-immigration discussion. Singh, who authorities said “fled” to California following the accident, was publicly extradited to the Sunshine State by Lt. Gov. Jay Collins, recently elevated to the position ahead of a contentious GOP gubernatorial primary. Gov. Ron DeSantis has said that law officers let him go because at the time they lacked probable cause to detain him.
Uthmeier, meanwhile, has called upon the federal government to consider permanently banning California and Washington from issuing CDLs.
Florida’s interstate subpoenas are not the first example of Uthmeier taking his hardline, anti-undocumented immigration agenda onto the national stage. In June, he brainstormed Alligator Alcatraz — a brand-new, massive migrant detention center in the Everglades — with the Department of Homeland Security.
President Donald Trump visited the facility, the first of its kind, on its opening day. This inspired DHS to take to states like Indiana and Nebraska to support similarly alliterative replicas, like the “Speedway Slammer” and “Cornhusker Clink.” DeSantis has since floated “Deportation Depot” in Northeast Florida and the “Panhandle Pokey” in West Florida.
A federal judge last month blocked the Everglades facility from accepting more detainees, demanding the center deconstruct by September’s end.

Free.,Trump administration urges Supreme Court to quickly overturn ruling against tariffs,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-urges-supreme-court-quickly-overturn-ruling-against-tariffs,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is urging the Supreme Court to quickly take up the president’s emergency tariffs case to avoid ""catastrophic"" economic consequences for the United States, according to a filing.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent argued in the Wednesday petition that roughly $750 billion to $1 trillion in tariff revenue is at stake if the justices accept the case through the normal session timeline, which ends in June 2026. The U.S. could face having to refund the import taxes paid by U.S. companies, Bessent said. President Donald Trump and administration officials have asked the Supreme Court to overturn Friday’s federal appellate ruling that affirmed the president does not have authority to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act. Trump is the first president to trigger tariffs under the IEEPA. The ruling upheld an earlier decision by the U.S. Court of International Trade. The decision is stayed while Trump officials appeal.Tariffs paid by domestic purchasers, businessesTrump began imposing wide-reaching tariffs in February and escalated them in the following months on goods from around the globe after declaring national emergencies — first over illegal fentanyl smuggling, and then declaring trade deficits an emergency. A trade deficit means the U.S. imports more goods from a country than that nation’s businesses purchase from U.S. suppliers.Domestic businesses and purchasers now pay the U.S. government anywhere from 10% to 50% in tariffs on most imported products. The government had collected nearly $82 billion by June 30, according to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol data. Trump’s emergency tariffs were challenged in court by several private businesses and a dozen states that sued the administration for using emergency powers to trigger the steep import taxes — the first time a U.S. president had ever done so.Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico and Oregon were among states, led by Democratic attorneys general, that brought the suit.Businesses that sued the Trump administration include the lead plaintiff, V.O.S. Selections, a New York-based company that imports wine and spirits from 16 countries, according to its website. Other plaintiffs include a Utah-based plastics producer, a Virginia-based children’s electricity learning kit maker, a Pennsylvania-based fishing gear company, and a Vermont-based women’s cycling apparel company.Trade frameworksBessent argued the ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is jeopardizing trade frameworks the administration has arranged with Japan, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, Vietnam, South Korea, and the European Union.The administration has announced several unofficial deals over recent months and has touted securing hundreds of billions in investment from other nations in exchange for lower tariffs.“World leaders are questioning the President's authority to impose tariffs, walking away from or delaying negotiations, and/or imposing a different calculus on their negotiating positions. The court’s ruling has taken away substantial negotiating leverage for the president to achieve the best trade deals for the American people,” Bessent wrote in a declaration attached to the administration’s motion to expedite the case, should the justices agree to take it.In asking the Supreme Court to take the case, U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer argued the tariffs are the administration’s “most significant economic and foreign-policy initiative … which President Trump has determined are necessary to rectify America’s country-killing trade deficits and to stem the flood of fentanyl across our borders.”Sauer is Trump’s former personal defense attorney who argued on Trump’s behalf before the high court last year.",,,,2025-09-04 13:57:45.892244

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma higher education officials on Thursday voted to revoke a policy that allowed some immigrant students lacking legal status to pay in-state tuition at state colleges and universities in limited circumstances. 
The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education were previously permitted by state law to do so, but a federal judge on Friday ruled the Oklahoma law is unconstitutional and violates the Supremacy Clause.
The U.S. Department of Justice sued Oklahoma over the statute last month and argued the measure extended eligibility for in-state tuition to some immigrants while not extending that treatment to U.S. citizens in other states. Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond filed a motion in support of the lawsuit. 
The policy change is predicted to affect around 400 students attending Oklahoma’s public colleges and universities, said Chancellor Sean Burrage. The change is effective immediately.
The State Regents are interpreting the order to mean that students who have already enrolled in classes and paid in-state tuition before Friday’s order will not have to pay non-resident tuition, he said. 
“It’s my understanding that all the institutions have been in constant communication with the students that attend that institution,” Burrage said. 
Oklahoma was one of 23 states and Washington D.C. that offered in-state tuition and financial aid benefits for some students without permanent legal residency status, according to an analysis by the Higher Education Portal, which is a platform for data, resources and policy analysis regarding immigrant student populations.
Under the now-defunct law, Oklahoma’s public colleges and universities were allowed to offer in-state tuition to anyone who graduates high school in the state and resides in Oklahoma for at least two years prior to graduation.
The lawsuit argued this included “undocumented immigrants.”

Janet Mills gives her state of the budget address in January 2025. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)The Maine Bureau of Insurance announced steep increases in 2026 health insurance premiums for more than 100,000 Maine people on Thursday, prompting Gov. Janet Mills to ask Congress to extend a tax credit to insulate people from those higher costs.
The enhanced premium tax credit lowers the cost of health insurance for people who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. It’s currently unclear whether Congress or the president will extend the tax credit, which is scheduled to expire at the end of the year. 
In a letter to Maine’s congressional delegation on Thursday, Mills called on U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King and Reps. Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden to ensure Congress extends the tax credit by Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. 
If not, Mills wrote, by late October Mainers insured by the state-based health insurance marketplace, CoverME.gov, will receive notices of 2026 premiums that “will reflect steep increases that will prompt many consumers to drop coverage before Open Enrollment even begins.” Mills added that “a later extension will not undo the damage and coverage losses will be irreversible.” 
Superintendent of the Maine Bureau of Insurance Robert Carey attributed the increased premium costs for next year to the instability of federal policies, including the expiring credits and the impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Other factors include the growing costs of medical services and prescription drugs, Carey said in a statement.  
Other state regulators are also facing this issue. Nationally, premiums in the individual insurance market are expected to increase an average of 20% next year, according to estimates from the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
Thousands of Mainers could see their monthly health premiums increase by as much as 117% if the tax credits are not extended, Mills warned in her letter. 
Of the 61,000 Maine people who enroll through CoverME.gov, 85% rely on premium tax credits to reduce their monthly costs. These families are expected to see an average premium increase of $258 per month if the enhanced credits expire. The average increase for households will approach $286 per month when combined with insurer-submitted 2026 rate increases. 
Nearly 9,500 consumers — 18% of those receiving assistance — will lose all premium support if the enhanced credits expire, leading to average increases of more than $900 per month.
During state budget hearings this past spring, representatives of Consumers for Affordable Health Care, a nonpartisan nonprofit committed to helping all Mainers obtain affordable health care coverage, testified in favor of increasing funding for the assistance program that helps Mainers navigate insurance challenges and warned about compounded costs if subsidies were not extended.
Further, because of cuts at the federal level, the nonprofit said some Mainers who currently have employer-sponsored coverage may be at risk of losing their jobs and therefore coverage. Mills has also warned of the Trump administration’s policies causing harm to Maine people, particularly significant cuts to Medicaid included in the sweeping budget reconciliation package.

Primary Care Providers in VT’s Northeast Kingdom (NEK) are keen to emphasize the message that mental well-being matters just as much as physical health.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mental health is health.","Dr. Dana Kraus, NCHC’s Clinician Lead to Quality and Primary Care Provider at St. Johnsbury Community Health Center
For nearly 20 years, Northern Counties Health Care (NCHC) has embraced the integration of behavioral health and primary care. As one of Vermont’s pioneering Medical Homes in the Blueprint for Health initiative, NCHC has long embodied the state’s vision of comprehensive, coordinated care.
Today, with five Federally-Qualified Health Center (FQHC) primary care clinics, and two walk-in Express Care sites in Newport and St. Johnsbury, NCHC continues to set the standard for integrated services in the Northeast Kingdom (NEK).
“By integrating behavioral health within our primary care clinics, we’ve fundamentally transformed our approach to care. We’ve broken down the barriers of stigma and fragmentation, ensuring that every patient receives whole-person care, seamlessly and conveniently, ultimately leading to better health outcomes for our community and a more rewarding practice for our providers,” says Jesse Dimick, NCHC’s Director of FQHC Operations.
Recently, NCHC was awarded the prestigious National Quality Leader – Behavioral Health badge from the Health Resources & Service Administration (HRSA) Community Health Quality Recognition program, placing it among a select group of U.S. health centers, and the only one in Vermont, recognized for excellence in behavioral health care.


What Behavioral Health Means
Behavioral health includes our mental, emotional, and social well-being, as well as the services that prevent and treat conditions such as depression, anxiety, trauma, and substance use. Because physical and behavioral health affect one another, challenges in one area can worsen the other. Addressing the whole person—body and mind—is key to long-term health. That’s where integration of behavioral health care into primary care comes in.
What Integration Looks Like
Integration is more than co-locating services. At NCHC, each clinic offers access to licensed behavioral health counselors, psychiatric nurse practitioners, Peer Support Workers, and Opioid Use Disorder Care Coordinators.
These behavioral health specialists work as a team with medical providers, nurses and community health workers —sharing information, coordinating care, and supporting patients together. That means:
·       Easier access to behavioral health support in the same place you receive primary care.
·       Fewer delays and smoother transitions—your provider can connect you to help right away.
·       Care that treats you as a whole person.
“Not everyone feels comfortable or knows where to start when it comes to finding behavioral health care, especially in rural communities,” says Claudia Alexander, LICSW, Behavioral Health Program Manager at NCHC. “At NCHC, we make it a seamless part of your visit with a primary care provider. You might find out you have high blood pressure and share that life has been stressful lately — your provider can then introduce you to one of our Peer Support Workers or counselors, and you can schedule a follow-up before you even leave the clinic. We can usually get people in with a member of our behavioral health team within one to two weeks.”
Overcoming Barriers
Historically, primary care and behavioral health operated in silos, with separate systems, funding, and even records. Barriers like insurance rules, provider shortages, and stigma have made access difficult—especially in rural areas like the NEK.  But integration breaks down those barriers by making behavioral health a natural part of a primary care visit.
“There are lots of barriers to accessing mental health and substance use treatment services… especially here in the NEK.  Awareness of the right resources which are affordable or covered by insurance…that’s a big one.  Also stigma about getting treatment since its expected that people can just cope with everything that comes their way and somehow its shameful to need help. That’s huge.  Getting a referral for treatment or services can mean a long wait time, or delay or miscommunication between providers.  That’s frustrating and inconvenient,” said a patient at NCHC’s St. Johnsbury Community Health Center.  “When services are right there in your primary care provider’s office, you don’t have to deal with those barriers because your provider has spoken to you about the services and maybe even made an internal referral or a warm handoff that day to someone else who can help. And if my provider recommends something to me, I tend to take it to heart and try to follow her advice – I trust her.”
Support and Investment
Research shows that integrated care improves both physical and behavioral health outcomes.  Integrated care improves the patient experience of care and gets rid of several of the biggest barriers that people have to accessing behavioral health services: awareness, time, convenience, cost, fragmentation and stigma.
Integration also improves staff and provider experience.  “A patient arrived for a scheduled office visit ready to engage with substance use treatment. Stephanie Gochie, our Peer Support Worker, sat with her, explained what needed to happen, and stayed with the patient while she made the phone call to the rehab facility. Steph probably spent 30 minutes or more that neither the provider nor rooming staff would have been able to spend, and the patient received support and encouragement while making that difficult call,” said Gianna Menapace-Drew, APRN at Concord Health Center.
But sustaining and deepening integration takes time, effort and resources.  Since 2023, NCHC has participated in the Vermont Blueprint for Health’s Mental Health Integration into Primary Care initiative, expanding services and adding Peer Support Workers to the care team.
In 2024, NCHC received a Behavioral Health Service Expansion grant from HRSA, one of only three FQHCs in Vermont to earn this competitive award.  With support from the grant, NCHC expanded access to mental health and substance use care by hiring Peer Support Workers in the two Express Care locations, improving access to support in walkable locations and outside traditional hours.  NCHC also invested in specialized trainings—like hosting the region’s first in-person EMDR training—so staff can better meet the diverse needs of patients. The grant also allowed expanded opioid use treatment through new staffing, extended hours, and a partnership with EMS to build rapid-access pathways.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-04 17:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Fate of Prospect Medical Holdings’ CT hospitals remains in limbo,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/04/prospect-medical-ct-hospitals-sale-delayed/,"Prospect has yet to disclose potential buyers for court-supervised sale of three CT hospitals — a potentially concerning sign, experts say.","Two weeks ago, Prospect Medical Holdings said an announcement regarding initial bids for its three Connecticut hospitals — Waterbury Hospital, Manchester Memorial and Rockville General — was imminent. 
The company has yet to disclose any details on interested buyers. 
Experts say that could be a sign the facilities aren’t attracting strong interest in the court-supervised sale — part of a months-long bankruptcy proceeding the company filed in January.
During a hearing on Aug. 20, a lawyer for Prospect said several times that the company would announce initial bidders for the Connecticut hospitals within days. But, as of Thursday, Prospect still had not named a “stalking horse bidder,” the first bidder in a bankruptcy auction whose offer serves as the minimum bid. 
Prospect must complete the sale auction for the Connecticut hospitals by Sept. 19 and a final order approving the transaction must be entered by Oct. 3, according to a recently updated agreement with one of its lenders.
The company has already missed several such deadlines. 
Roughly a month after Prospect filed for bankruptcy protection, the company set a timeline for the Connecticut sale, including a bid deadline of late May 2025 and a sale hearing, where the court would approve a new owner, for June 5, according to court documents submitted to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of Northern District of Texas. 
“Most likely, if in the last six to eight months they have not teed up a sale for the Connecticut hospitals, it means they’re probably having difficulty finding a buyer,” Ken Rosen, a bankruptcy attorney with experience in the health care industry, said. He added that it’s possible Prospect has a buyer lined up but that the parties have not yet been able to agree on price or contract terms. 
Spokespeople for Prospect Medical Holdings did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Matthew Beatman, a Bridgeport-based bankruptcy attorney, also said the delays could be concerning and added that the timeline extensions likely reflect a major effort underway to avoid hospital closures. 
“The preference would be to see a private party come in, or private parties come in, and have some continuation for one or all of [the hospitals],” Beatman said. “Whether or not that’s feasible and going to happen, no one knows. But it sounds like no one wants to give up yet.”
But in the case of some Prospect-owned hospitals, closures were unavoidable. 
Prospect shuttered its two remaining Pennsylvania hospitals earlier this year after failing to find a viable buyer, even after the state provided more than $15 million over seven months to help keep the facilities open. 
In Massachusetts, Steward Health Care, another formerly private equity-backed hospital operator that declared bankruptcy in May of last year, closed two hospitals after failing to receive any qualified bids for the facilities.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont, said the administration is preparing for all possible outcomes.
“The state has been actively working for many months now to prepare for any eventuality that may occur with these facilities to ensure continuity of care and preserving these community assets.”
When Prospect filed for bankruptcy in January, Lamont vowed to keep the hospitals open.
But, months later, as part of a broader agreement, the state Office of Health Strategy granted Prospect permission to convert one of its three Connecticut hospitals — Rockville General in Vernon — from a full-service acute care hospital into a satellite campus of Manchester Memorial Hospital, located 20 minutes away. While not technically a closure, the agreement cleared a path for Prospect to permanently shutter all services aside from the emergency and behavioral health departments.
During the same August hearing where a Prospect lawyer said bids for the Connecticut hospitals were imminent, the company also admitted that none of the offers it had received to date were as high as a $435 million offer Yale New Haven Health agreed to pay for the facilities in April 2022. 
The attorney also discussed a motion Prospect filed seeking to hold Yale New Haven to the terms of the deal. If the motion is successful, Yale would either have to purchase the hospitals for $435 million, pay a penalty to Prospect or challenge the company in court. The bankruptcy court judge is slated to decide whether to grant that request in a hearing scheduled for Sept. 23.
During the hearing, the judge encouraged Yale and Prospect to enter into mediation talks.
Dana Marnane, a spokesperson for Yale New Haven Health, confirmed that the health system had agreed to mediation talks. But she declined to provide any additional information on what potential outcomes could be, including whether Yale New Haven would consider purchasing the hospitals at a lower price.
“At the request of the court overseeing Prospect’s bankruptcy proceedings, Yale New Haven Health has agreed to meet with Prospect and other parties, including representatives from the State of Connecticut,” Marnane stated in emailed comments.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023_0927_SR_WaterburyHospital_027-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-04 13:57:45.892244
,California,2025-09-04 17:28:38+00:00,CalMatters,Will California ban companies from charging vets to secure benefits? Some say it should,Adam Ashton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/09/veterans-claims/,"A burgeoning for-profit industry caters to veterans who want help preparing disability claims. California may ban the practice, which is known for high fees that some view as exploitative.","In summary
A burgeoning for-profit industry caters to veterans who want help preparing disability claims. California may ban the practice, which is known for high fees that some view as exploitative.


The $1,102 Adan Montalvo gets every month in disability from the Department of Veterans Affairs makes a difference for him, but he regrets the price he paid for it. 
Montalvo was able to obtain the benefit after signing a contract with a private company that compiles medical evidence to help veterans establish disability claims. The process worked, and Montalvo began receiving the money some 52 years after he left the Army with a bad knee. 
But there was a catch. His contract with Trajector Medical required him to pay five times the value of his new monthly benefit almost right away. That was $5,500 he didn’t have. 
“They wanted to collect all of it, and I told them how am I going to give you money I don’t have?” he said. 
For the second year in a row, California lawmakers are on the brink of banning fees for the kind of service Montalvo received. 
Critics of the paid services say the practice already is illegal under a federal law that says only accredited officers can help veterans file those claims, and that claims representatives can be paid only under specific circumstances. And, they note that veterans can get the same assistance for free from county veteran service offices, as well as from several veterans organizations that have long been accredited with the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
But the law banning paid services lost its teeth after a 2006 overhaul removed criminal penalties for violations,helping to spawn a burgeoning for-profit industry that now caters to veterans who want help with the VA’s notoriously slow claims process. 
That’s an affront to many former military service members who view the charges as a violation of the compact the nation makes with those who serve. Several of the companies have fee formulas similar to what Montalvo paid. That could result in a charge of $20,000 depending on the veteran’s disability rating. 
“We shouldn’t be charging veterans outrageous amounts of money to access their benefits, benefits they earned through their service,” said Sen. Bob Archuleta, a Democrat from Norwalk who sponsored Senate Bill 694 to ban unaccredited companies from assisting California veterans with disability claims. 
His bill is awaiting a final vote in the Assembly after clearing the Senate and several legislative committees by overwhelming majorities. Its supporters, however, are not yet celebrating. A similar measure died last year late in the legislative process without a vote in an appropriations committee. One of the larger veterans’ claims companies also is making a concerted push to defend its business as a legitimate alternative to free services.
“We are serving veterans. Yes, we’re doing it as a business but just because we’re doing it as a business doesn’t mean we’re not providing an essential service,” said Bill Taylor, a former Army officer who is the cofounder of Veterans Guardian.
He became the face of the industry over the last four years as first Congress and then state legislatures took up bills to prohibit unaccredited veterans claims services. His company contributed $1.4 million to members of Congress and spent $1.9 million on federal lobbying in 2023 and 2024, according to the campaign finance website Open Secrets. In California this year, his company and another spent $235,000 on lobbying against Archuleta’s bill, according to the website California Lobby Search. 
“Maybe we were the only ones who recognized the existential threat to the industry.
I don’t have a choice; I have to be here,” Taylor said in an interview with CalMatters during a recent visit to Sacramento.
The result is something of a stalemate. Congress has neither passed legislation to reinstate criminal penalties for unaccredited veterans claims services nor passed a competing bill that would permit the companies to operate.
States adopt different policies
States are moving in different directions, too. Maine, New Jersey and New York passed laws to ban the for-profit consultants, while Louisiana passed a law to allow them, according to the news organization Stateline. 
Taylor is urging lawmakers enact policies that would regulate the claims industry, such as by capping fees and prohibiting misleading advertising. He noted that his company has no shortage of clients, and the people often turn to it out of frustration with the VA or with free claims services. 
But Archuleta and the veterans groups supporting his proposal say it’s impossible to distinguish bad actors from responsible ones. They want California to step in with a state policy until Congress resolves whether the for-profit claims consultants can gain accreditation and be regulated by the federal government. 
“The point is here you should never take money from the veteran. That is absolutely scandalous that that is permitted,” William Swenson, a Medal of Honor recipient from the Afghanistan War who recently visited Sacramento to meet with lawmakers in support of Archuleta’s bill, told CalMatters. He now is working for a company that is developing a different approach to helping veterans with their claims.
Veterans unprepared for fee
Montalvo, 72, of Lamont was able to work out a payment plan with Trajector. It includes a small interest fee. He said he had his knee checked when he left the Army in 1973, but it didn’t result in a disability rating. 
He said Trajector reached out to him by a text message and a phone call, and he replied thinking it was worth a shot. Today, his monthly disability check helps with groceries, although he’s sending more than half of it to Trajector and he pays off his bill.

John Ryan, 68, had a similar experience with Trajector. “They were really polite and I was under the influence that they worked with the VA, as soon as I got the impression I felt relaxed. They asked me questions and they moved pretty fast. I was surprised they got results so fast,” he said.
His claim resulted in $171 monthly disability payment for hearing loss stemming his service in the Marines. He said he also was unprepared to pay Trajector’s full fee right away, although he has paid it off. 
Trajector spokesperson Steven Zenofsky said the company strives to make its fee structure clear to veterans before working with them. Like Taylor’s Veterans Guardian, Trajector also was co-founded by a veteran and its leaders view themselves as helping former military service members navigate a confusing process.
If a veteran receives $1,000 a month after working with a claims consultant, Zenofsky said, “That’s $1,000 a month tax free. From that perspective, many of our clients would say ‘The fee was for a valuable service provided that I wouldn’t normally get on my own, and for life.’” 
Sen. Archuleta wants to steer more resources to California’s county veteran service officers, who are accredited to work on VA claims and can help direct veterans to a wide range of services in addition to disability payments. 
David West, who served in the Marine Corps and is a Nevada County veterans services officer, has been an outspoken advocate for the bill. He was once homeless, and he said at one point in his life he would have signed a contract with a for-profit claims consultant. 
He would have regretted it, he said. 
“That’s not what my recruiter promised me,” he said “You’re 19. You come in, we’ll take care of you and you’ll never have to pay a thing.”
“We can’t allow for this middleman to show up and break that promise,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/082725-Veterans-Benefits-LV-04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-04 13:57:45.892244

Chris Butters)The U.S. Coast Guard announced Tuesday that it has awarded a $137 million contract for the first phase of a project intended to allow its Seattle base to host two new heavy icebreakers.
The contract, awarded to The Whiting-Turner Contracting Company, covers dredging of the Coast Guard’s Slip 36 and construction of two ship berths capable of hosting the new icebreakers, formally known as Polar Security Cutters.
The first of those ships, the Polar Sentinel, is expected to be complete in 2030. When accepted into the Coast Guard, it will be the service’s first new heavy icebreaker since the Polar Star was commissioned in 1977.
The Coast Guard operates the federal government’s icebreaker fleet, and the Polar Star is key to supplying American research bases in Antarctica from its Seattle home port. 
A second and third heavy icebreaker were fully funded with $4.3 billion included as part of the Republican budget package approved by Congress and President Donald Trump earlier this year. 
The budget package also included $300 million for port construction in Juneau to support the newly commissioned Coast Guard icebreaker Storis, a converted oilfield services ship. Until that work is complete, the Storis will be homeported in Seattle.
The Republican budget package, known as the “Big Beautiful Bill Act,” includes billions of dollars for shoreside port facilities like those in Juneau and Seattle.
Additional phases of work are expected in Seattle, which is expected to be the home port of four new major Coast Guard cutters, the service said in a written statement.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/8612890-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-09-04 13:57:45.892244

(Photo by Stew Milne for the Alabama Reflector)Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen told a federal judge Thursday he still does not know if the governor will call a special session to redraw state Senate districts in Montgomery after a ruling that they violate the Voting Rights Act.
U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco, appointed by President Donald Trump, issued a decision last month that Senate Districts 25 and 26 violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act by giving Black voters less opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice than other voters. She ordered lawmakers to revise the capital-area districts in time for the 2026 midterm elections. 
“Counsel remain in contact with Legislative leadership and with the Governor’s office but cannot say at this time when a decision will be made or what it will be,” Allen wrote in his latest status report. “Counsel understand that the officials who would be involved in a special session of the Legislature are actively discussing the matter and progress has been made, but no final decision has been reached.”
The qualifying period for the midterm election is in January for the Republican Party, but the Democratic Party has yet to set its dates.
Allen previously reported his uncertainty about what the Legislature would do to comply with the order but said a special session could happen in late September or early October. He appealed the order to wait for a final decision until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a similar case in Louisiana.
Messages seeking comment were left with the office of Gov. Kay Ivey and Speaker of the House Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, on Thursday morning.
Manasco said if the Legislature does not redraw the districts, she would appoint a special master to do so. She intends to appoint Richard Allen as the special master, David Ely as his cartographer, and Michael Scodro and his law firm, Mayer Brown LLP, as the special master’s legal counsel if the Legislature does not redraw the map. It is the same team that redrew the state’s congressional districts. Neither Allen nor the plaintiffs objected to the appointment.
Should the ruling be upheld, it would be the second time in four years a federal court found Alabama’s 2021 congressional and legislative maps to be racially discriminatory. A three-judge panel that included Manasco ruled in 2022 that the state’s congressional map did not give Black voters a proper opportunity to choose their preferred leaders, eventually resulting in a new congressional map with a majority Black district in west Alabama and a near-majority Black district in the southern Black Belt.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AL_Senate_023-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-04 13:57:45.892244

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)COLDWATER — The Comanche County School District’s superintendent landed on paid administrative leave in the wake of a community uprising led by parents angry with how the school board initially responded to allegations he sexually harassed a student.
A Kansas student reported her coach for harassment and touching. School leaders kept it quiet.

More than 100 residents of the rural southwest Kansas school district — including some displaying raw, intense emotion — descended on the high school Wednesday night to demand ouster or suspension of superintendent Ty Theurer.
“How in the world did we get here?” said Zach Ellis, a county commissioner who has children in the district. “Does this board not have a responsibility to the kids of this district to do the right thing? Kids don’t feel safe in this building. You have created a hostile and toxic learning environment as well as a toxic working environment.”
School board president Kelly Herd, who became aware of the student’s harassment complaint four months ago, had resisted punishment of Theurer beyond the warning placed in his personnel file. She had told fellow board members no additional sanction was necessary in response to an allegation that Theurer, while serving as golf coach, advised a female student to hold clubs like she were gripping a penis. The girl had also complained of unwanted touching by Theurer.
Theurer signed a summary of the student’s complaint months ago, which was viewed by the student’s parents as an admission of guilt.
Herd also sent emails to other board members saying Theurer “did not deny nor make excuses” and “has been written up.”
In front of an unusually large crowd, the seven-member board moved in and out of executive session several times before Herd sought a motion to relieve Theurer of administrative duties in the 300-student district. He wasn’t at work Wednesday and didn’t attend the school board meeting after Kansas Reflector published an article Tuesday detailing allegations against the superintendent and the school board’s tepid response.

The school board didn’t discuss publicly the reason for taking action against Theurer at this time. There was no board disclosure about who would temporarily lead the district or for how long.
The board adopted a vague motion to proceed with “next steps” that the board president said had been discussed in executive session. None of that information was shared with the audience.
“Horrible,” school board member Dean Yoder said in an interview after the meeting. “It was not handled in May. It’s still not being handled in the right manner.”
He said the school board should have fired Theurer in the spring, and no evidence has surfaced to dissuade him of that necessity.
After Herd adjourned the meeting, the audience hurled questions at the school board. In the back-and-forth, school board vice president Andy Uhl confirmed Theurer was placed on paid leave.
An investigator with the Kansas Association of School Boards has compiled a draft report regarding an inquiry into allegations against Theurer. The board met behind closed doors with a KASB attorney before voting to relieve the superintendent of all administrative responsibilities.
The regular public comment portion of the meeting was moved to the back of the agenda. When that moment arrived, the school board president said she would forbid any speaker from referring to district employees or students. She asserted, without offering a justification, that such public statements would violate privacy rights of individuals.
“The board appreciates patrons taking the time to talk to us about our policies and procedures,” Herd said. “Please, understand this is not an appropriate time or place for patrons to make comments of a personal nature about any district employee or student.”
Initially, Herd told the audience that she wanted to convince Ellis — the only person to fill out an application for permission to speak — to share his concerns with the school board in a closed executive session. Herd’s suggestion was widely opposed by people in the crowd, including Ellis.
“You don’t get to go into executive session just because you don’t want to hear what I’ve got to say,” Ellis shouted.
Another person in the room challenged this secretive approach: “He speaks for a lot of us.”
“Is that a unanimous board decision?” Ellis continued. “Because I bet it wasn’t.”
“I’m not finished,” Herd shot back. “I’m going to let you speak. You have five minutes. You can’t mention anybody by name. If it gets out of control, we will stop it.”
Ellis didn’t mention the superintendent’s name during his speech, but there was no doubt he was talking about Theurer. Ellis accused Herd of running school board meetings with an iron hand and of stifling dissent among her elected peers on the school board.
In terms of the sexual harassment allegation, Ellis said, “The people who are sworn to protect these people have failed.”
“If you think that this is or was an isolated incident,” he said, “you are nuttier than a pile of bull crap. It’s a pattern in what now seems to be a decade of abuse.”
When the timer hit 5 minutes, Herd told Ellis that his time was up.
“Hey, freedom of speech,” said a man at the back of the room.
Another person was adamant: “Let him speak.”
Herd ignored their pleas and asked for a motion to go into another executive session rather than hear more from Ellis. Briefly, Ellis and Herd were simultaneously addressing the audience.
There was a puzzled response from the crowd when Herd declared the board would proceed with “next steps” in terms of the district’s leadership structure. She didn’t articulate elements of that plan.
“No questions. No answers,” one crowd member said.
“What if it was your daughter?” a woman yelled.
Ellis said he was optimistic change would come to the Comanche County school system, given the number of disgruntled people present at the meeting.
“You have awoke a sleeping giant, and we are pissed off,” Ellis said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Comanche-County-school-board-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-04 12:57:03.042169

(Photos courtesy of the U.S. House of Representatives and Iowa Legislature)Following incumbent U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson’s Senate campaign launch, some Republicans, including former U.S. Rep. Rod Blum, have hinted they are planning to run for Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District in 2026.
Hinson, who has represented the northeast Iowa district for three terms, announced Tuesday she would run for Senate, shortly after U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst said she would not run for a third term. Hinson quickly became the frontrunner for the GOP nomination following her entrance into the race, getting endorsements from Republican senators and House GOP leadership.
Hinson’s pivot to the Senate race means Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District will not have an incumbent in the 2026 elections. There are currently no Republicans who have announced campaigns for the seat, but in the wake of the Tuesday campaign shake-up, Blum, who previously represented the area in Congress, teased a 2026 run.

In a Facebook post Tuesday, Blum thanked supporters for encouraging him to launch another run for Congress.
“The outpouring of support has been humbling – it was the honor of my lifetime to represent our district for four years, standing squarely with President Trump and backing his America First agenda,” Blum wrote. “Stay tuned!”
Blum, 70, served two terms representing Iowa’s 1st Congressional District — the northeast area of the state that largely became the 2nd District during the 2020 redistricting process. He was first elected in 2014, defeating former Iowa House Speaker Pat Murphy, the Democratic candidate, and won a second term in 2016. Blum lost the seat in 2018 to former U.S. Rep. Abby Finkenauer, a Democrat.
The Republican was also previously the CEO of Eagle Point Software, and currently owns the construction software company Digital Canal.
In addition to Blum, Iowa Rep. Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta, also wrote on social media Tuesday she is weighing a run for the 2nd District. Lundgren, who has served in the state legislature since 2018, wrote that the district “must continue to be represented by an America first conservative, whose roots run deep in our community.”
“Serving Iowa continues to be a calling, and that’s why I’m seriously considering jumping into this congressional race,” Lundgren wrote. “I endorsed President Trump long before the caucuses, and I’d be with him every day in Congress. My family and I will continue to discuss our next steps with friends and neighbors and pray for wisdom in our decision. We will announce our plans in the days ahead.”
Though political forecasters still predict Republicans will likely keep the seat in the midterms, the race may be more contentious than previously considered. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has listed the 2nd District as a potential pick-up, and recent special election wins have fueled hope for some Iowa Democrats aiming to break conservatives’ hold on state and federal elected positions.
There are three Democrats competing to become the party nominee for the 2nd District race in 2026. Iowa Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque, Clint Twedt-Ball, the founder of the nonprofit Matthew 25 and Kathy Dolter, the former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College, have all announced campaigns.
After Hinson left the race, the Democratic candidates emphasized that their campaigns were not focused on Hinson, but on providing better representation for the district.
“I decided to run for Congress not to oppose any candidate but to be a fierce advocate for Iowans,” James said in a statement. “As Republicans search for a new candidate, our campaign’s momentum continues to grow. Too many Iowans face impossible choices when it comes to building the lives they want and deserve, and I am dedicated to listening to them and being their voice in Washington D.C.”
Twedt-Ball said in a statement following Hinson’s announcement that northeast Iowans have spent too long watching “career politicians like Ashley Hinson put their political ambitions over the needs of Iowans.”
“It’s time for a fresh, positive start in Iowa’s second district,” Twedt-Ball said.

Jared Moskowitz says his goal is to run for re-election to his congressional seat in Palm Beach and Broward counties next year and not for the U.S. Senate.
But he tells Chuck Todd in a podcast released this week that he may have no choice but to run statewide if the GOP plan to redistrict the state severely hurts his ability to be re-elected.
“I’m not looking at [the Senate seat], I’m looking at re-election, but if for some reason Republicans decide to do all the gerrymandering, and decide to set me free from my district, perhaps, then I would look at it, Chuck,” Moskowitz said on “The Chuck Toddcast” featuring the former Meet The Press host.
Moskowitz defeated Republican Joe Kaufman by nearly 5 points in the race for Congressional District 23 last November, outperforming Kamala Harris, who defeated Donald Trump by 2 percentage points in the district.
Gov. Ron DeSantis says he intends to redraw Florida’s congressional map before the 2026 election. Speaking in Lake Worth on Aug. 20, DeSantis indicated there are “questions” regarding some of the congressional districts in Southeast Florida.
“I’m absolutely going to get targeted,” Moskowitz told Todd regarding how he believes the GOP will redraw the congressional maps. “My district’s the closest in the state.”
Moskowitz added that his intention remains to run for his House seat next year.
“I actually hope that I’m running for re-election,” he said. “They don’t mess with Fair Districts [amendment] and violate the Constitution, and I hope to make Hakeem Jeffries the Speaker, because, no offense to [Senate Majority Leader] Chuck Schumer, flipping the Senate vs. flipping the House — different. Democrats have to get a wing of government back. … If we don’t win in ’26, I don’t know what will be left of the party.”
Fair Districts won voter approval in 2010 and are intended to block the Legislature from designing districts to benefit any political party or incumbent.

Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia), who is on the House Judiciary Committee and other panels, also joined the race in early July.
The latest to enter the fray is Rep. Morgan Cephas (D-Philadelphia), who is the chair of the Philadelphia caucus in the House, who announced her candidacy on Wednesday.
Evans, who was a member of the General Assembly for decades, has served in the U.S. Congress since 2016. Evans has cruised to reelection time after time and did not face a challenger in the general election in some years.
The seat, which includes nearly half of Philadelphia, is a “safe Democratic” district, according to several national ratings outlets.
Christopher Borick, director of Muhlenberg College’s Institute of Public Opinion, told the Capital-Star in an interview in July that the winner of the primary election would likely go on to succeed Evans.
“If you win that primary, you’re going to Congress,” Borick said. “It’s as simple as that.”
The race for the 3rd District is also expected to be a “very costly primary fight,” Borick noted, since it is entirely inside the Philadelphia media market.
“I’d expect that to be among the most pricey primaries we see in this cycle,” he said.
While Cephas, Rabb, and Street are the most recognizable candidates in the race as of early September, there are others who are seeking the Democratic nomination. 
Democrats who have also filed include Dave Oxman, a physician, Robin Toldens, who the Philadelphia Inquirer reports is a former city government employee and real estate agent, Karl Morris, a professor at Temple University, and Gabriel Caceres.
The seven candidates that have filed make it the most crowded race to date for Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation. 
No Republicans as of Sept. 4 have filed to run for the seat.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uscapitoljune302025ashleymurray-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-09-04 12:57:03.042169

(Photo courtesy of National Weather Service)North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Thursday made his second presidential disaster request of the summer. 
Armstrong sent a letter to President Donald Trump and the Federal Emergency Management Agency requesting federal help in recovering from storms that damaged buildings and other infrastructure Aug. 7-8. 
The storms with tornadoes, winds up to 100 mph and large hail knocked out power to 16,000 residents in south-central and eastern North Dakota, Armstrong’s letter said.  Electrical infrastructure damage is estimated at $5.5 million.
Armstrong asked Trump to declare a major disaster for Barnes, Grand Forks, Griggs, Kidder, Nelson, Steele and Stutsman counties. The letter says the hardest hit area was Stutsman County, including the cities of Jamestown and Courtenay. 
Without federal support, Armstrong’s letter said the cost of recovery will fall on taxpayers and utility customers. 
“The hardships created by these severe storms pushed many emergency management offices beyond their capacity, forcing them to juggle response, recovery, and resource coordination under immense pressure,” Armstrong said in the letter. 
Armstrong had previously requested a presidential major disaster declaration for storms in June that killed four people and caused more than $11 million in damage to public infrastructure in North Dakota. That request is still pending. 
Thursday’s letter notes that the August storms tracked a similar path to the June storms. 
The governor’s latest request comes after a statewide disaster declaration by Armstrong on Tuesday.

(Via Florida House)While it was no surprise that two Democrats easily won special legislative elections in Orange County on Tuesday night, party members contend that their margins of victory indicate increased voter intensity for Florida Democrats going into 2026.
Democrat LaVon Bracy Davis defeated Republican Willie J. Montague in the Senate District 15 race by 46 points, 73%-27%. That seat had been vacant since February after the previous occupant, Geraldine Thompson, died at 76 following complications from knee surgery.
In the House District 40 race that became open after Bracy Davis stepped down from the seat to run for Senate, Democrat RaShon Young defeated Republican Tuan Lee by 50 points, 75%-25%.
By comparison, Democrat Kamala Harris defeated Donald Trump in the county 56%-42% last November.
 ‘Frustrations of Floridians’
“When you look at our over-performance on what happened on Tuesday, while the Democrats voted, the NPAs voted, we had a lot of Republicans that voted on this side as well,” Bracy Davis said in a Zoom conference call organized by the Florida Democratic Party on Thursday.
“And I think that speaks to the frustration of Floridians. Floridians really want our Legislature to be focused on issues that affect them. They’re sick of culture wars. They’re sick of folks they’ve sent to Tallahassee that are focused on everything but their pocketbooks,” she continued.
“We spent an extended session last session, and we were passing bills like changing textbooks from Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America, and no constituent, Democrat or Republican, has called me asking for that. They’re asking me about property insurance and they’re asking me about rent caps and they’re asking me about this affordability crisis and ensuring that they have medical care.”
Bracy Davis has represented District 40 in the state House since 2022. She submitted her formal resignation from the seat in April, and it became effective on Sept. 1. She won the primary election for the Senate seat in June in a four-person field, defeating Coretta Anthony-Smith, former U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, and her brother, former state legislator Randolph Bracy.
Young, a former legislative chief-of-staff for Bracy Davis, defeated former state Rep. Travaris McCurdy in the June Democratic primary. At 26, he is now the youngest member of the Florida House.

“People are sick and tired of the wasteful spending. They’re sick and tired of people overlooking the issues that are impacting them. They don’t want to have conversations about road art. They don’t want to have conversations about an internment camp. They don’t want an internment camp in their state,” he said Thursday.
“What they want is to make sure that they can put food on their tables. That they can have sustainable healthcare. That they can afford to put gas in their car. And these are the things that are not being addressed. So, these wins speak to the realization of people seeing that common-sense legislation starts with commonsense legislators, right? And the time for acquiescing to the desires of the governor or the president have come and gone, and we cannot continue to do it because Floridians are struggling. Floridians are hurting.”
Both seats are in Orange County, which remains a Democratic stronghold in a state that continues to move further red. According to the Orange County Supervisor of Elections, Democrats hold a 12-point voter registration lead in the county, 39%-27%, with another 30% registered as non-party-affiliated.
Republicans continue to enjoy a supermajority advantage over Democrats in both the state House and Senate. There are now 11 Democrats in the 40-member Senate, one independent, and 26 Republicans, with three vacancies. In the House, they now control 86 seats to the Democrats’ 32, with two vacancies.

National Guard troops and units from states outside the district  violates laws against using the military for domestic law enforcement and a 1973 federal law allowing the district to govern itself, D.C. Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb wrote in a complaint in federal court in the district.“No American jurisdiction should be involuntarily subjected to military occupation,” the complaint says, adding that Trump’s “command and control of out-of-state National Guard units when they are in state militia status violates the Constitution and federal law.”The administration’s actions, which Trump has characterized as an attempt to control crime in the city, “flout the Posse Comitatus Act,” a 19th-century law, and other sections of federal law that “enshrine the nation’s foundational prohibition on the participation of military forces in domestic law enforcement absent the most extreme exigencies, such as an invasion or rebellion,” the complaint said.“Defendants have established a massive, seemingly indefinite law enforcement operation in the District subject to direct military command. The danger that such an operation poses to individual liberty and democratic rule is self-evident,” the complaint said.Despite a Tuesday morning ruling from a federal judge in California that called Trump’s use of military personnel for law enforcement in Los Angeles illegal, the president has continued to explore further use of Guard units for what he said is crime prevention in other U.S. cities. States with a military presence in the district cited in the suit are Louisiana, South Dakota, Ohio, West Virginia, Tennessee, Mississippi and South Carolina.This is a developing report that will be updated.",,,,2025-09-04 12:57:03.042169

BURLINGTON — A Shelburne police sergeant has pleaded guilty to a reduced charge that will allow him to avoid jail time for driving on-duty in his cruiser into and killing a cyclist. Prosecutors say he was driving faster than the posted speed limit.  
Kyle Kapitanski, 42, entered the guilty plea Thursday morning in Chittenden County Superior criminal court in Burlington to a misdemeanor charge of negligent operation with death resulting in the November crash that killed 38-year-old Sean Hayes of Burlington.
Kapitanski was sentenced as part of the plea deal with prosecutors to six to 12 months in jail, all suspended. In addition, he was ordered to serve two years on probation and during that time he will be required to participate in a reparative justice program. 
According to the court documents, Kapitanski was behind the wheel of a Shelburne Ford Explorer cruiser early on the morning of Nov. 11, 2024, when he struck and killed Hayes on Shelburne Road in South Burlington.
Kapitanski had initially been charged with a felony offense of grossly negligent operation of a motor vehicle with death resulting. That charge carries a possible penalty of up to 15 years in prison, if convicted.
Vermont State Police investigators who led the probe into the incident alleged in an initial affidavit that Kapitanski was driving his Shelburne Ford Explorer cruiser about 40 to 45 mph in a 35 mph zone on Shelburne Road near an intersection with Fayette Drive when the crash occurred.

Leading up to the crash, the affidavit stated, Kapitanski had YouTube videos playing on a computer tablet mounted in his cruiser. A review of that device showed “several” YouTube web addresses accessed between 2:29 a.m. and 2:40 a.m, the court document stated.
Also, the review by investigators stated there was “no evidence of user interaction” with the device during that time period. The crash took place at about 2:40 a.m.
The investigator’s review found that the last web browser video “appeared visually consistent” with what was shown on Kapitanski’s body-worn camera, the affidavit stated.
A link to the last video was provided in the filing and it was titled, “Trans woman CONFRONTING Matt Walsh takes UNEXPECTED turn.” 
David Sleigh, an attorney representing Kapitanski, contended there was no proof his client was distracted while driving by videos. 
The misdemeanor charge Kapitanski pleaded guilty to was based on Kapitanski’s speed above the posted limit, according to the prosecution.   
State police said the roadway where the crash took place was wet at the time of the crash from rain.
Hayes had been seen in a video taken from a nearby business standing within the roadway but near the curb with his bicycle that had been towing a trailer, according to court documents.
A police affidavit also stated it appeared Hayes was adjusting the bicycle and trailer before he started walking southbound along with the bicycle when Kapitanski’s cruiser struck him.
Hayes’ estate has brought a civil lawsuit against the town of Shelburne in connection with the fatal crash. 
Kapitanski was placed on paid leave following the crash from his job with the Shelburne Police Department. His status with the police department was not immediately clear Thursday.

The idea is that they can take the place of law […],"Gov. Glenn Youngkin listens to featured speakers during the two year anniversary of the Right Help, Right Now mental health support initiative on Dec. 11, 2024.  Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia MercuryValley Health in Winchester is piloting a program that can test the effectiveness of a new avenue in Virginia’s mental health resources landscape. 
Special Conservators of the Peace are armed and unarmed professional personnel authorized by courts to carry out limited law enforcement duties. The idea is that they can take the place of law enforcement officers to accompany people in mental health crises to hospitals. Having launched mid-August, Gov. Glenn Youngkin celebrated the new program on Wednesday.
Sometimes in mental health crises where a person is at a high risk of harming themselves or others, law enforcement is ordered to step in. Patients are escorted to hospitals for evaluations, but this takes time and in some cases, law enforcement officers’ presence can further agitate someone in a vulnerable mental state. This is where Virginia’s new SCOPs program comes in.
The pilot is a piece of Youngkin’s Right Help, Right Now initiative, as SCOPs are part of the puzzle of responding to mental health issues in Virginia. 
“We are ensuring patients in crisis receive compassionate care in the right environment while working side-by-side with law enforcement to keep our communities safe,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Valley Health is demonstrating the impact of this model, and together we are building a stronger, more responsive system for the Commonwealth.” 
Between Youngkin’s plan and numerous legislation by lawmakers predating his tenure as governor, Virginia has been able to create mobile crisis units of trained clinicians that can respond alongside or instead of law enforcement, rolled out a substance abuse online resource hub, and supported the 988 crisis hotline. Virginia’s Behavioral Health Commission also routinely meets to study and make recommendations for improving programs. 
For the SCOP proposal, Youngkin teased the idea last December when presenting his budget plans for 2025. The goal then had been to invest $35 million of the state budget into that workforce. Though resources like 988 and mobile crisis units can prevent someone from needing to go to a hospital, Youngkin believes the conservators can help improve outcomes of people who are taken to hospitals by law enforcement.
Often, it’s law enforcement officers that are the first responders and they escort people to get medical care rather than putting them in jail. Other times, people might be subject to emergency custody orders — when a magistrate deems someone could be a harm to themselves or others and need to be evaluated by health professionals. 
Consensus has been building that officers and deputies aren’t always the best people to take point or remain with people in crisis for long periods of time. Smaller police departments in rural areas have also argued these duties take officers out of traditional patrols or away from other emergencies they could be responding to instead.
“Not only should there be less police interactions with someone who’s going through a crisis, but when you’re looking at rural areas such as the county where I’m from and small police departments throughout the region, then taking just one person off patrol can hurt a community,” Tazewell County Sheriff Brian Hieatt said at an event late last year. 
The concept will be further tested through  the new program at Valley Health. Since its launch on Aug. 19, Valley Health SCOPs have already supported 10 people. A press release about the program estimated that over 97 hours of law enforcement officer time was saved by having SCOPs step in. The program is expected to reach 24/7 operation by the end of this year. 
A $1.1 million dollar contract with the Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services is supporting the program. Overall, it can fund up to 18 full-time SCOPs, two special transport vehicles and additional drivers. 
State officials are optimistic about the idea. 
DBHDS Commissioner Nelson Smith said that the program “allows (officers) to get back to their community and provides a more therapeutic experience in our crisis system.”

The registered nurses at Northern Maine Medical Center in Fort Kent and at Houlton Regional Hospital overwhelmingly voted to authorize their bargaining teams to call a strike if the issues raised in contract negotiations aren’t resolved, according to a news release from the Maine State Nurses Association Thursday morning. 
There are no dates set for a strike at this point.
“We are fighting for patient safety and the ability to recruit and retain nurses at our hospital,” said Brad Martinez, a registered nurse in the emergency room and bargaining team member in Fort Kent. 
Report warns hospitals in Aroostook, Ellsworth face imminent risk of closure due to Medicaid cuts

Since his team has been at the bargaining table for 16 months, Martinez also said, “We should be much closer to a deal. Nurses voted to strike because the administration at NMMC has not addressed our concerns about safe staffing and fair pay.”
The nurses at both facilities are represented by Maine State Nurses Association/National Nurses Organizing Committee. Fort Kent nurses voted to join the organization in January 2024. 
While Fort Kent nurses are negotiating for their first contract, the last contract in Houlton expired in November 2024. Houlton nurses are similarly frustrated with the lack of progress in bargaining as they seek to address the same issues of safe staffing, recruitment and retention, and fair pay. 
Neither hospital responded to a request for comment by publication.
In April, Houlton nurses also spoke out against the planned closure of the labor, delivery, recovery and postpartum unit. Houlton Regional is one of five hospitals in Maine that have shut down their labor and delivery units since 2020, leaving expectant mothers in wide swaths of the state without local maternity care. 
“If a strike is what it takes for the voices of nurses to be heard, then so be it,” said Brooke Howland, a registered nurse in acute care at Houlton Regional and a bargaining team member. “Our administration could settle this contract now. We encourage them to do so.”
This comes as a new national report warns that sweeping Medicaid cuts recently signed into federal law could push hundreds of hospitals across the country to the brink of closure — and Maine’s rural hospitals are among the most vulnerable.

The first tipoff was a transfer of liquor licenses.
KUOO Radio in Dickinson County reported Aug. 14 that city councils in Okoboji and Spirit Lake had approved liquor licenses for Mega Saver, a convenience store chain in the Omaha area with some Florida locations. The license locations were gas stations for Kum & Go, a Des Moines-based chain that was acquired by Salt Lake City-based Maverik in 2023. Maverik announced this summer that it would rebrand all Kum & Go locations in the country and cut the Iowa administrative staff it inherited to “a limited presence.”
Days later, convenience store trade publication Mass Market Retailers picked up KUOO’s report. Then C-Store Dive got more details: Maverik was selling 20 locations in Iowa and three in Sioux Falls to Mega Saver, following the June sale of three Omaha locations. However, neither C-Store Dive nor CSP Daily News mentioned which Iowa Kum & Go stations were being sold.
The conversion of certain Kum & Go locations to Mega Saver has not been widely publicized. The discovery that the Kum & Go at the intersection of Blairs Ferry Road and Lindale Drive in Marion was closed Aug. 26 for such a conversion precipitated an inquiry through public records.
A list was compiled by cross-referencing Kum & Go’s 96-location Iowa list, which has yet to have any removed, with Maverik’s rebranding timeline. The locations not on the latter list were followed up by looking for city council meetings where liquor licenses for Mega Saver were approved. Then a better reference was located: the Iowa Lottery’s list of active retailers. In the last week of August, only five locations remained with Kum & Go as the licensee of record, and three of those were double-listed with Mega Saver. The 20 stores becoming Mega Savers have new identification numbers in sequential order. A dozen of them are in Polk and Dallas counties.


The 20 locations changing from Kum & Go to Mega Saver are:

The sole sites in Adel, Altoona, Okoboji, Polk City, Spirit Lake, and Winterset, and both in Marion
Ames: 3111 S. Duff Ave. (1 of 6 in the city)
Ankeny: 1825 N. Ankeny Blvd., 1025 E 1st St. (2 of 6)
Cedar Rapids: 2604 16th Ave. SW (1 of 4)
Clear Lake: 2005 U.S. Highway 18 E. (1 of 2)
Des Moines: 6304 SW 9th St. (1 of 7)
Grimes: 1880 SE Princeton Dr. (1 of 2)
Johnston: 5800 Northglenn Dr., 6130 NW 86th St. (2 of 3)
Urbandale: 12041 Douglas Pkwy., 4585 156th St., 4860 NW Urbandale Dr. (3 of 5)

A phone call to the De Soto gas station, one of the two locations listed by the Iowa Lottery only under Kum & Go, revealed that that location will become a Casey’s in the fall. The remaining Kum & Go in Grimes does not know its future status yet.
Until this change, Mega Saver’s only Iowa locations were in Council Bluffs. There are four there, two of which opened after January 2024. The Mega Saver at Abbott Drive and Avenue H is not in Carter Lake, despite what Google Maps shows. From the railroad tracks north to Carter Lake (the lake), there is a thin sliver of land west of Abbott Drive that is part of Omaha.
Mega Saver’s website says it was founded in 2002 and is “recognized as one of the top cell phone and accessory retailers in Nebraska.” It will have more Iowa locations (24) than QuikTrip (19), which is exclusively in Polk County.
Maverik rebranding timeline
Iowa’s first rebranded Maverik opened July 22 at the Neola exit off I-80 in western Iowa, with Adair following a day later. Right now, locations in the Des Moines metro are cycling through the 84-hour closure periods and scheduled to wrap up Oct. 21. Changes will come to the Iowa City area at the end of October, then Cedar Rapids and Ames in early November. The final Kum & Go stations in Iowa will be phased out of Sioux City in mid-November. The last two, in Sloan and on Gordon Drive in Sioux City, will close Nov. 17 and reopen Nov. 21.
The first Kum & Go opened in Hampton in 1959. In recent decades, nearly all the chain’s Iowa locations have been confined to large metro areas or freeway exits.

(Photo by Shalina Chatlani/ Stateline)COLUMBIA — South Carolinians would no longer be able to buy candy, sodas and other sugary drinks with government grocery benefits under a proposal released Thursday.
The request by Gov. Henry McMaster is part of the Trump administration’s “make America healthy again” initiative, which invited states to apply for waivers that limit how people can use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. A dozen other states have already received approval on their plans.
“This request is a light-touch, common-sense approach that ensures these federal taxpayer dollars are being used to help families purchase healthy, nutritious food – not unhealthy candy and sugary drinks,” McMaster said in a news release.
His executive order, issued Thursday, instructs the Department of Social Services to officially submit a request for the waiver within the next two weeks. If that application is rejected, the department should continue trying until the federal government accepts the state’s plan, McMaster said.
In South Carolina, items excluded should include energy drinks, candy bars and beverages sweetened with 5 grams or more of added sugar, such as ready-made lemonade, tea and sweetened coffee, according to the executive order.
Some senators attempted to add a similar restriction to the state budget, but it failed to get enough votes.
The specifics of what should or shouldn’t be excluded from purchase became a point of contention among senators. Some asked: Does honey count? What about granola bars, which often use honey to hold the other ingredients together? Or sports drinks, which contain helpful electrolytes along with sugar?
The governor’s plan specifies that granola bars and protein bars could still be bought with SNAP benefits. So could juices, as long as they’re at least half natural fruit or vegetable juice with no added sweeteners. Sports drinks would also still be allowed, according to the news release.
What would not be allowed are energy drinks, defined as beverages containing at least 65 milligrams of caffeine per 8 fluid ounces that are marketed as increasing mental or physical energy.
The application will define candy as “a preparation of sugar, honey, or other natural or artificial sweeteners in combination with chocolate, fruits, nuts, or other ingredients in the form of bars, drops, or pieces.”
When Gov. Nikki Haley made a similar move to restrict what SNAP benefits could buy in 2013, senators responded by adding a clause to the state budget that would prohibit the Governor’s Mansion from stocking junk food. (Haley changed her mind about the idea after receiving pushback in public meetings across the state.)
Sen. Darrell Jackson, a Columbia Democrat, repeated his proposal this time around.
“If it’s good for the poor people of Williamsburg County, it better be good for the people who live on Richland Street in the governor’s mansion,” Jackson said during the budget debate.

(Photo by Megan Gleason / Source NM)U.S. senators from New Mexico, Colorado and Idaho introduced legislation Wednesday to increase funds for local partnerships to prevent water pollution and restore watersheds.
The Headwater Protection act, sponsored by U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Colorado Democratic Sens. Micheal Bennet and John Hickenlooper and Idaho Republican Sens. Mike Crapo and James Risch, will increase funding for two U.S. Forest Service programs.
The bill, if passed, would triple the yearly funding for the Water Source Protection Program for the U.S. Forest Service in order to provide more than $30 million per year for farmers, ranchers, water utilities and local and tribal governments for restoring forests or cleaning up watersheds. The legislation would prioritize giving funds to projects to improve drinking water quality and harden forested areas to wildfire and climate change.
New Mexico is still reeling from the 2022 Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, the state’s largest wildfire, which burned more than 485 square miles in Northern New Mexico. On Tuesday, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham authorized more emergency funding for flood damages in Mora County and Las Vegas residents have had to drink bottled water for months as the city still tries to recover drinking water supplies since the fire.

Luján said in a statement that the introduced legislation would allow acequias — New Mexico irrigation systems — and land grant-mercedes (areas of land granted by either Spanish or Mexican governments) to apply for these funds for the first time.
“Water is essential to the health and safety of our communities. Protecting and improving our watersheds is critical to ensuring reliable access to clean drinking water and making our forests more resilient against wildfires,” Luján said. “The Headwaters Protection Act will strengthen these efforts by investing in watershed management and pollution prevention.”
A second provision in the bill would require the U.S. Forest Service to update its manual for restoring watersheds and require national forests to be managed to prevent further degradation.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-04 14:38:26+00:00,CT Mirror,It would cost CT billions to help very low-income renters secure homes,Abigail Brone | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/04/ct-low-income-renters-study/,"Nearly 240,000 renter families in CT are considered very low or extremely low income, and only about 50,000 of them receive rental assistance.","It would cost more than $2 billion for Connecticut’s Rental Assistance Program (RAP) to provide for every income-eligible family.
A new study by housing advocacy nonprofit, Partnership for Strong Communities, analyzes the level of housing assistance needed in Connecticut and what demand the RAP meets.
Nearly 240,000 renter families in Connecticut are considered very low or extremely low income, meaning their incomes do not exceed 50% or 30% of the Area Median Income (AMI), respectively.
Only about 50,000 of those families receive any form of rental assistance, according to the report, leaving more than 175,000 families without any aid.
To serve every income-eligible family under RAP, it would cost Connecticut about $2.5 billion, according to the report.
Sean Ghio, policy director with the Partnership, said the report is not calling on Connecticut to invest that much into the program. Rather, it lays out the scope of the state’s affordability crisis.
“Putting that number in the context of housing insecurity, family insecurity, educational consequences, economic consequences to the state,” Ghio said. “I think it’s really just, it’s another measure that shows the depth of the crisis.”
The report also considers the impact of smaller economic investments into RAP. Increasing the number of households served under RAP by 10%, or more than 600 families, would cost the state about $9 million annually.
Connecticut’s RAP provides housing vouchers for about 6,500 families, ensuring they pay no more than 40% of their monthly income on housing costs.
The goal of the report is to determine how much it would cost the state to care for every income eligible family under RAP, according to Samaila Adelaiye, the study’s author.
“It also speaks to the fact that, this is how large a problem this is based on policies like the under production of affordable housing across the state,” Adelaiye said.
In the most recent legislative session, state lawmakers approved an $18 million boost to RAP and several hundred additional vouchers for families with children, senior renters or families with disabilities.
However, with rising rent and inflation, the funding isn’t stretching as far and providing for as many families as it used to.
The issue comes back to increasing affordable housing production and ways to make existing housing more affordable for renters, Adelaiye said.
“More funding for the voucher program is always a good thing, right? More people are going to be impacted by this, or are going to have access to safe, secure and affordable housing through this,” Adelaiye said. “However, I think we always want to go back to the fact that if there’s long-term more housing development, more affordable housing development is key.”

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Hundreds of University of South Carolina professors packed a campus theater to hear from college leadership — many for the first time — on the involvement of the state’s largest university system in a new college accrediting commission under development in Florida.
It was standing room only in the 300-seat Russell House theater Wednesday during an event to introduce new faculty members — a meeting that in the past has been sparsely attended by the school’s nearly 1,800 teaching faculty.
Most were there to hear from the chairman of the school’s governing board, Thad Westbrook, about USC’s partnership with state schools in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas to form the new Commission for Public Higher Education.
Politics and higher education
Republicans have billed the commission as a way to end “woke indoctrination” on the campuses of the University System of Georgia, the University of North Carolina system, the University of Tennessee system, and the Texas A&M University system, as well as USC.
USC joins DeSantis’ push to create new university accreditor to ‘upend’ ‘woke accreditation cartels’

While the board chairman has sidestepped politics in explaining what drew USC to this new partnership, those sentiments by politicians, including Gov. Henry McMaster, are what caused major consternation among the professors in attendance Wednesday.
Those who spoke worried what it could mean for their ability to teach and conduct research related in any way to race, gender, climate science and other matters that have morphed into a political football in recent years.
“I know there’s been political rhetoric around it, and some politicians have talked about it,” Westbrook said. “I would hope that there’s nothing political related to (Commission for Public Higher Education.)”
The comment earned mocking laughter and groans of disbelief from the crowd. Someone shouted “come on” while others whispered under their breath that the new organization was a farce.
Westbrook stood behind the podium quietly absorbing the criticism and waiting for the murmurs to die down before continuing.
If politics are involved, he said, “that’s a problem for higher education.”
‘No where near the final exam’
Westbrook spoke for about 10 minutes, offering some new details not previously publicized, before fielding questions from faculty for the remainder of the hour.
This fall, 10 schools are expected to take part in the commission’s initial round of pre-accreditation.
The organization must complete this before the U.S. Department of Education will fully recognize it as an accreditor. No USC system schools are in that initial batch, Westbrook said, and the full approval process with federal regulators will take at least two years.
The soonest a USC school would even consider seeking accreditation through the new organization would be 2029, when USC Beaufort is up for renewal.
Until then, USC will gauge the experience of the other schools before making a final decision.
“The bottom line is it’s very early in this process, and we’re not at a point where we’re ready to make a decision,” Westbrook said.
“We’re nowhere near the final exam,” he added, making an analogy to college coursework.
‘Judge us by our record’
About 20 professors lined up along both aisles of the theater waiting for what would be their first opportunity to ask a board member directly about the effort.
Each received loud applause and head nods from their colleagues after voicing their questions and airing their concerns. Westbrook waited each time for the noise to stop and answered questions from all who came to the microphones.
Mindy Fenske, an English professor, asked about the commission’s business plan, which calls for member schools to contribute $4 million each.
Westbrook responded that the commission has not yet asked USC for funds.
Questions from others — Kirk Randazzo, a political science professor; education professor Susi Long; English professor Mark Minett; and Bret Kloos, a psychology professor — followed similar themes.
All raised concerns about whether their subject matter might be construed as “woke” or categorized as diversity, equity and inclusion and therefore face restrictions. They worried about the university’s independence from outside influence. They called it risky to go from a long-established accreditor to one that’s untested.
And Laura Brashears, a sociology professor, pointed to vague language in the first draft of 24 proposed accreditation standards the new organization began circulating last month. She said they call for faculty with a “diversity of viewpoints” without defining what that means and how it will be measured.
Westbrook repeatedly tried to allay fears, suggesting USC’s board has steered away from heavy-handed policies on diversity, equity and inclusion or denial of tenure to those who teach controversial subjects, as seen in other states.
“I know there is a national conversation going on,” Westbrook said to one speaker. “I would ask you just to judge us by our record.”
“We here at the university, we’ve done anything we can to protect academic freedom. I haven’t seen anything we’ve done as an institution to impact what you’re teaching,” he replied to another.
“Those are things that are not happening in South Carolina,” he said again.
Westbrook also encouraged the professors to provide feedback on the draft standards, which are open for public comment through Sept. 16.
How it started and changes to come
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced the proposal for the new accreditation agency in June. Referring to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, which accredits schools across the Southeast, DeSantis blasted what he called the “woke accreditation cartel,” which has been “hijacked by radical ideology.”
On the campaign trail, President Donald Trump called accreditation his “secret weapon” in reshaping higher education to end what he considers ideological bias.
In April, he signed an executive order to expedite the federal approval of new accreditors, which is what the Commission for Public Higher Education is relying on for its own process. The order also threatens to suspend accreditors that take into account a college’s diversity programs.
Asked whether the USC board was unhappy with the current accreditation under Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, Westbrook repeated past statements that the process is “overly burdensome.”
He went on to tell the crowd that the southeastern accreditor recently came under new leadership and the recently hired president, Stephen Pruitt, has told the USC board his organization is working on making its own changes.
More information on those changes is expected later this month.

(Photo by Michael M.

Juan Manuel Lopez-Campos, who has lived in the United States for 26 years and has no criminal record, was arrested during a traffic stop in June and held for more than two months without a bond hearing.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan filed a lawsuit on his behalf, resulting in a late August ruling by U.S. District Judge Brandy R. McMillion that a Trump-era directive to deny bond hearings to certain immigrants was “not only wrong but also fundamentally unfair.” McMillion was appointed by President Joe Biden. 
Lopez-Campos was released Wednesday.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I am happy to finally be with my family with the help of my legal team,” he said in a statement released by the ACLU. “I hope to continue to fight my case.”
The directive, issued in July by the Trump administration, sought to reverse longstanding policy by eliminating access to bond hearings for immigrants in civil detention. Legal experts said the rule, if left in place, would have subjected individuals to mandatory detention without judicial review for months or even years.
“We are thrilled that Juan gets to go home to his family while his immigration case proceeds. It was not only illegal, but inhumane, to keep locked up this longtime Detroit resident, who has close ties to his family, community and church. Justice was served,” Ramis J. Wadood, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Michigan, said. 
However, Wadood said hundreds, if not thousands, of other immigrants are still being wrongly denied their legal rights.
“Because of that, we will not rest until every affected individual is allowed to exercise the same right to due process and has a chance to come home to their families,” Wadood asserted.
Lopez-Campos was among more than 1,400 immigrants arrested in Michigan by federal agents since President Donald Trump began his second term in January, vowing to “launch the largest deportation program in American history to get the criminals out.”
Most of those arrested had no criminal convictions according to records compiled by the Deportation Data Project.
Shahad Atiya, Lopez-Campos’s attorney who worked with the ACLU on the case, said the government had “no legitimate reason” to keep him detained.
“The cruelty was the point, but we’re glad that justice prevailed,” Atiya said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-04 10:56:44.593403

""The Charles is a beloved resource. People should be able to use it without worrying about getting sick. As our climate changes and it gets hotter, people should be able to swim there.”
The post Full of crap: Climate change could cause more sewage pollution for rivers, lakes, and beaches appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","ON A NICE sunny day in Boston, there are usually people out on the Charles River sailing, kayaking, paddleboarding, canoeing, rowing – coming into contact with the water. You’ll likely find children playing, tourists taking a scenic tour around the river to enjoy a view of Boston, and groups of people learning how to sail. 
It looks idyllic and a far cry from the “dirty water” that the Standells sang about Boston in 1966. It’s even come a long way since former Gov. William Weld jumped face-first and fully clothed into the murky water in 1995 as a vote of confidence in the cleanliness of the river. 
But even on those picturesque sunny days when people are enjoying the river, it’s possible that there is still sewage in the water – especially after heavy rainstorms. 
The Greater Boston area has parts of a legacy combined sewer system where both wastewater and stormwater are collected in shared pipes, and during heavy rains, excess flow bypasses the treatment centers where it is supposed to be cleaned. Instead, it is discharged into local water bodies to prevent backups into people’s homes. 
In 1985, the federal government ordered the Greater Boston area to end wastewater pollution of Boston Harbor and its tributaries, including the Charles and Mystic Rivers. Since then, many combined sewer overflow sites – where wastewater is discharged – have been closed. The average annual average discharge volume from combined sewer overflows into the Charles River basin has decreased by 98 percent since 1988. 
Despite major progress, more than 40 combined sewer overflow sites along the Charles, Mystic, Alewife Brook, and Boston Harbor persist – partly because addressing them comes with more complicated engineering challenges and therefore higher costs. Climate change is expected to double or even quadruple the volume of overflow that is dumped into these water bodies by 2050, according to projections from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, and the cities of Cambridge and Somerville. These three entities are collaborating on a draft plan – due this December – to address the remaining sites, balancing the rising overflow risks with the significant costs of remediation.
In the meantime, advocates for eliminating the combined sewer overflow sites entirely – including the river watershed associations – are pushing for the plan to be ambitious, while others are pushing for a plan that prioritizes affordability. 
“If this new long-term control plan just has some sort of incremental reductions or makes things a little bit better, that’s going to be a big problem because climate change will just reverse those efforts,” said Julie Wood, climate resilience director at the Charles River Watershed Association. “We’d like to see essentially the combined sewer overflows eliminated because that’s really the only way you won’t start to go backwards.”
Wood’s nonprofit is running a campaign with the slogan “Cut the Crap” with poop emojis on posters and costumes to get raw sewage out of the Charles. They have put up signs on MBTA trains and a large banner on the pedestrian bridge over the Massachusetts Turnpike in Allston. 
“We need to end this problem,” said Wood. “The Charles is a beloved resource. People should be able to use it without worrying about getting sick. As our climate changes and it gets hotter, people should be able to swim there.”
At a public meeting in January, the MWRA, Somerville, and Cambridge presented several proposals to tackle the remaining overflows. The projects presented have timelines that span 40 to 50 years and could cost up to $4 billion, depending on which alternative is chosen. 
Matt Romero, the head of the MWRA advisory board, called for an approach that would be the least cost to sewage ratepayers.
“If we could wave a magic wand and make all the combined sewer overflows disappear, we obviously would,” said Romero. “But we live in the real world. And these are real dollars from real families and real rate payers. What we really need to always take into account is looking at what level of control [over the combined sewer overflows] that is going to be the right balance for the dollars that are being spent.”
Wood said that it is possible that funding for the remaining combined sewer overflows can be secured from sources other than ratepayers like state-issued bonds. 

In July, wastewater flowed into the Charles twice, and both occurred during rainfalls with less than an inch of rain. On August 14, there was another alert that wastewater went into the river.
Mark Jacobson, vice president of Charles River Recreation, which rents boats on the Charles and Mystic, offers boating classes on both rivers including a class that teaches people how to turn a kayak right side up if it capsizes. That involves being fully submerged in the water.
He said that overflow events and poor water quality caused by cyanobacteria have meant his company had to turn customers away and reschedule bookings. 
Jacobson said he sees people out on the river the next day after overflow events. Public health officials recommend avoiding contact with contaminated water for 48 hours after an overflow event because there might still be a risk of bacteria and other pollutants.   
“Very few people know about combined sewer overflows,” said Jacobson. “People figure that this is many years after the Clean Water Act and are surprised. They really don’t expect that that’s happening in Massachusetts in 2025.”
Even with the occasional overflows, the Charles River is a relatively clean body of water in comparison with other places around the state. Across Massachusetts, there are about 190 remaining overflow sites, and many are located within lower-income communities. In the municipalities that have an overflow site, 85 percent of the total population lives within an environmental justice area, according to the Department of Environmental Protection
Research has shown that exposure to waterbodies following combined sewer overflow events can result in public health issues. A 2024 study focusing on the Merrimack Valley, an area with more than 30 remaining combined sewer overflow sites, found that these events are linked to an increase in emergency department visits due to acute gastrointestinal illness. 
Nathan Sanders, a data scientist affiliated with the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, has done research on how low-income communities face an increased risk of exposure to sewage. He points out that other parts of the state haven’t made nearly the progress that the Charles has.
 “There are many more water bodies, beaches, rivers, and lakes, around Massachusetts that don’t yet enjoy the same water quality that the Charles does,” said Sanders. “Environmental justice communities experience a significantly higher burden of sewage pollution than comparable watersheds that have whiter and richer and more English-speaking demographics. That is the state of things today after having a decade of really substantial investment into controlling sewage pollution. And so that’s what I think needs to change.”
The state tried to address the lack of public information in 2021 with a law that required the operators of the combined sewer overflow sites to notify the public with alerts when untreated sewage is released into the water. Through that law, the state began collecting more robust data on combined sewer overflow events in mid-2022 and compiling an annual report.
In 2023, which was a particularly rainy year, there were 606 overflow events where 2,847 million gallons of untreated sewage were dumped into water bodies across the Commonwealth. In 2024, there were far fewer events – 137 overflows – and 1,948 million gallons dumped. 
Rep. Greg Schwartz of Newton and Rep. David Rogers of Cambridge have sponsored a bill that would require all owners of combined sewer systems to eliminate all combined overflows into the state’s waterways by the year 2050. 
“This is not a problem that is going to go away,” said Schwartz, who also enjoys boating on the Charles. “While we’ve had some success in reducing the large amount of the combined sewer overflow problem, it still exists in many of our rivers and waterways. It’s only going to get worse with the climate change impact on weather and specifically rainfall.”
According to Schwartz, setting a 25-year goal of elimination is important to get momentum behind addressing the public health impacts of combined sewer overflows.
“We should be setting our sights and aspirations to achieve a future where we can actually be confident that people will not have to avoid the water when it’s hot, and if they do go boating or swimming, they don’t have to end up in an emergency room,” said Schwartz.

The state auditor oversees local government finances and aids law enforcement in investigating financial crimes. Blaha, a Democrat, was first elected in 2018 and narrowly won her reelection bid in 2022. Her departure creates an open race for a constitutional office next year.
Blaha in a statement said when she first assumed office that the state auditor was “under attack” because funding cuts had gutted office staff.
“I’ve had the honor of serving as Minnesota’s state auditor,” Blaha said. “My goals were to rebuild an office that was under attack and protect Minnesotans’ rights to make decisions in their local communities. I am proud to have accomplished those goals.”

(Photos: Barrick 2024 Annual Report; 	iStock Editorial / Getty Images Plus)Congratulations to Barrick, Newmont, and lesser lights in Nevada’s historic folkloric gold mining industry. 
The price of gold is setting all-time records, soaring north of $3,600 an ounce this week. It broke the $3,500 mark for the first time on Friday. The price has increased by more than 30% since January.
Why has the price of gold been on a months-long upward surge?
The same reason the price of gold surged after 9-11, during the Great Recession, and in the pandemic.
Gold is often viewed by investors as a port in a storm, a “safe haven” investment during chaotic times. 
In other words, gold’s skyrocketing price is thanks to Trump.
No, not because Trump’s driving up the price of gold by hoovering up oodles of it to make the Oval Office  look like, as Jack White put it, “a vulgar, gold leafed and gaudy professional wrestler’s dressing room.”
Trump is to thank for gold’s price surge, precious metal markets researcher Adrian Ash with BoullionVault explained to the BBC earlier this week, because of  “what he’s done to geopolitics” and “what he’s done to global trade.”
And Trump, ever the ambitious one, is not content with creating economic chaos, confusion, and uncertainty with petulantly pronounced tariffs while disintegrating alliances among capitalist democracies. He’s also hell-bent on destroying what is sometimes called the “exorbitant privilege” afforded the United States by having the dominant currency on planet Earth. 
If Trump successfully reduces the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors from an independent entity into just another random collection of Trump toadies and bootlickers on the government dole, that promises to undermine the credibility and stability of what has been the world’s most credible and stable currency since at least the end of World War II.
The ensuing financial system upheaval would wreak havoc not only on the U.S. economy, but the planet’s. (And no, crypto will not save you.)
An unstable, helter-skelter tyrant flirting with global economic mayhem? That’s the sort of prospect that prompts some investors to buy gold. Even at today’s prices.
Las Vegas, the home of nothing if not faith in branding
That’s also the sort of prospect that can prompt consumers to hunker down.
Neither the independence of the Federal Reserve nor the price of gold may be on the minds of the 12% of the traveling world that, if Las Vegas visitor volume had matched last summer’s, would have come to Las Vegas this summer, but didn’t.
But sometimes there is a wisdom of crowds. 
And a 12% drop in visitor volume sounds like a crowd might know something’s wrong. Or at least suspect as much.
A common narrative holds that Las Vegas visitor volume and other economic indicators are down because prices and junk fees charged to tourists are way up. There’s almost certainly some truth to that; willingness of industry to overdo it in the course of gouging customers should never be underestimated.
But that narrative, both on social media and in more traditional venues, is sometimes presented as a sole culprit, as if to focus on a problem that can be remedied locally, so as to reassure the traveling and touristing public that Las Vegas gets it, and that the always and ever innovative and adaptive Las Vegas is fixing it.
At the same time, the narrative diverts attention away from the malignant force causing prices and fees to now seem even more onerous: The guy who’s been smearing cheesy gold  tchotchkes and geegaws on every available surface in the Oval Office. 
It’s almost as if Las Vegas, the home of nothing if not faith in advertising, believes it only needs to get the messaging just right.  Then the rest of the country, and the world, somehow won’t notice Trump poses a threat to to the economy on a scale comparable to the hardships inflicted by 9-11, the Great Recession, or the pandemic. If only Las Vegas can devise clever enough branding — or so the narrative goes — instead of watching their wallets, tourists from Temecula to Tokyo — maybe even Toronto (but probably not) — will open their wallets to come to Las Vegas and eat and gamble and see the Sphere.
The two culprits — “it’s a Trump slump” vs. “it’s junk fees” — are not an either/or. The Las Vegas resort industry is souring its own brand. And Trump is freaking people out. Both can be true.
In fact, not only are they not mutually exclusive. They’re working in a toxic tandem to erode the Las Vegas tourism market.
Good luck
Las Vegas is more an echo or indicator of the national economy than a significant contributor to it. If and when the economy crashes around Nevadans’ shoes again, the Las Vegas economy will once again be at the mercy of the national economy, and forced to await a national recovery. As in prior economic collapses, help from state and local governments will be grossly inadequate. Nevada state and local government is deliberately designed to be impotent in a crisis. 
The federal government came to the rescue of both the state and its people during the last economic crisis. 
That doesn’t seem very, well, Trumpy, since Trump obviously has no intention of acknowledging the economy — his economy — is anything other than practically perfect in every way. (Occasional reminder: If Trump really wanted a good economy, he would have left it alone.)
Trump has floated the idea of giving people checks, signed by him of course, from revenue generated by U.S. businesses now paying historically steep import taxes that Trump unilaterally and unconstitutionally imposed on them while self-described anti-tax Republicans in Nevada and the nation quietly curled up in fetal positions.
If and when Trump sends people checks emblazoned with his big beautiful signature, rest assured those checks will be smaller than the benefits every family was receiving under the expanded child tax credit program in 2021 that cut child poverty in the U.S. in half. 
But c’mon. Cutting child poverty? Why even bring that up? Whatever a majority of Nevada voters were thinking about when they decided it would be fun to elect Oswald Cobblepot president, it wasn’t child poverty.
Meanwhile, no matter how bad things get, remember, at least there’s a tax deduction on tipped earnings. For two whole years! That should provide some comfort to the small (and presumably getting smaller) minority of higher paid tipped workers who actually earn enough to qualify for a noticeable tax benefit.
Maybe the tiny proportion of the Nevada workforce employed at gold mines will travel to Las Vegas, and tip.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Image-9-3-25-at-8.39 PM-1-1024x619.jpeg,,,2025-09-04 09:56:16.130846

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Hundreds of people were ticketed or arrested during a state-funded saturation patrol that put 15 additional state troopers on the streets of South Dakota’s largest city last week.
The troopers labored from Aug. 27 through Aug. 29 under the banner of “Operation Prairie Thunder,” a two-pronged public safety initiative announced in July by Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden.
One part of the operation, branded with a caricature of a buffalo with a badge on its hat and lightning bolts on its sunglasses, involved Rhoden directing six members of the South Dakota National Guard to process deportation arrest paperwork for the seven Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents stationed in the state. That prong of the public safety platform also included an agreement between the state Department of Corrections and ICE to help the federal agency sniff out immigrant inmates without legal status in the state’s prisons.
South Dakota National Guard troops begin processing immigration paperwork for ICE

Guard troops in Sioux Falls and Rapid City began their work last month; the Corrections Department turned 10 migrants, paroled in mid-August, over to ICE agents for removal from the U.S.
The other prong of Rhoden’s plan put additional Highway Patrol resources on tap for Sioux Falls, whose metro area is home to nearly a third of South Dakota’s residents. 
Calls for service in the city have grown significantly since 2015, as has the population. The 16 homicides in the city last year were the most in its history.
The Sioux Falls Police Department’s statistics show its overall per capita violent crime rate fell in 2024, however, the year covered by the department’s most recently published annual report. That year, the city had fewer aggravated assaults, stolen vehicles, burglaries and fraud cases than 2023. Narcotics arrests rose slightly from 2023 to 2024, and police seized more narcotics by weight — the largest jump was in grams of Fentanyl seized — but the number of drug arrests was 700 below its 2019 peak. 
The late August saturation patrol is the first of what will be two per month for the next five months. After that point, Rhoden told South Dakota Searchlight this week, “we’ll reevaluate” the city’s need for additional assistance.
Troopers made 174 drug arrests during the first patrol, 44 of which involved felony-level drugs like methamphetamine or cocaine. The governor said 32 of the felony arrests involved methamphetamine, and troopers served 24 outstanding felony warrants on people stopped by troopers during the operation.
“All in all, this was a very successful first saturation patrol,” Rhoden said.
A Highway Patrol helicopter was used to track a vehicle during one of three pursuits.  
The patrol didn’t focus on immigration, Rhoden said, but troopers logged 14 ICE “encounters,” eight of which resulted in ICE arrests.
The state’s involvement with ICE drew criticism from people at a Sioux Falls City Council meeting last month, and Democratic state lawmakers derided the operation as a misguided use of state resources. At the time of the announcement, Rhoden said the Highway Patrol would absorb the costs.
The patrol’s 287(g) agreement with ICE allows troopers to detain people suspected of being in the country illegally. Col. Casey Collins of the Highway Patrol told South Dakota Searchlight in a Wednesday email that ICE can check the legal status of a person suspected of lacking legal status without physically coming to the scene of a traffic stop. 
“No subjects were detained beyond the scope of the traffic stop without an arrest,” said Collins.
Some of the six people whose legal status was questioned during a traffic stop — but who were not arrested by ICE — were later detained on state charges, Collins said.
“Identifying a subject is normal procedure during a traffic stop where a violation has occurred and enforcement action is being taken,” Collins said.

If you don’t want to take your medical advice from U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, you’ll soon be able to consult with an alternate public health resource backed by the blue states on the West Coast. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office said Wednesday that California is joining a West Coast Health Alliance with Oregon and Washington to provide residents with vaccine safety information.
They rolled out the plan on the same day that Florida officials went the other direction, pushing to eliminate all vaccine mandates, including requirements for school children to be protected against the measles, chickenpox and Hepatitis B.
The three-state group comes as high-profile oustings, resignations and policy changes roil the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more infectious and severe variants of COVID-19 surge through California and other states this summer.
The alliance echoes one California joined in 2020 to review COVID-19 vaccines during President Donald Trump’s first administration.

Newsom, in a statement: “Trump’s mass firing of CDC doctors and scientists — and his blatant politicization of the agency — is a direct assault on the health and safety of the American people. The CDC has become a political tool that increasingly peddles ideology instead of science, ideology that will lead to severe health consequences.”

Eight left-leaning Northeastern states, including Massachusetts, New York and Vermont, have also banded together to create their own regional public health authority separate from the CDC.
Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UCSF professor of medicine specializing in infectious diseases, raised some concerns about how different guidelines from various state-led coalitions could lead to confusion among the public and health insurance companies.

Chin-Hong: “All of this assault on vaccines and turmoil at the CDC and turning science upside down couldn’t come at a worse time. The only people who suffer are community members who are confused as to how they can protect themselves. They can’t get protection even if they wanted to.”

Nevertheless, he welcomed the creation of the Western alliance. So did former Sen. Richard Pan, the Sacramento physician who authored a 2015 state law mandating stronger immunization protections for children. 
It’s important that state governments “step up” when “the federal government can no longer be trusted to provide unbiased, fact-based recommendations on protecting our health,” said Pan.

Pan: “This is a fundamental public safety issue. You’re as dead from a germ as you are from a bullet or a fire. … We had one of the best public health organizations in the world and we decided to destroy it.”

Spokesperson sues Assembly speaker

From CalMatters politics and campaign reporter Yue Stella Yu: 
A former spokesperson to California Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas sued the top Democrat Tuesday, arguing he fired her and publicly retaliated against her after she alleged a colleague sexually harassed her and after she raised complaints about Rivas’ brother’s influence over the lawmaker.
Cynthia Moreno was fired last month after an internal investigation found that she had made sexual remarks to “various employees,” according to redacted documents released from the Assembly. 
Moreno, who has denied the allegation, filed her lawsuit in the Sacramento Superior Court on Tuesday. She argued Rivas failed to address her sexual harassment complaint against a former colleague. She also claimed that the Salinas Democrat’s brother, political strategist Rick Rivas, exerted undue influence on his policy making — a claim that has followed the speaker’s career for years.
Rivas spokesperson Elizabeth Ashford dismissed Moreno’s claim as “an attempt by a former employee to force a payout.”

Ashford: “The Speaker recused himself from all matters related to Ms. Moreno’s termination. … We will fight these false and defamatory claims aggressively, and we are confident they will be seen for what they are: absolutely meritness.”




What’s Newsom up to? He’s not saying

Gov. Newsom in recent months has spent his time doing a number of things, including launching a podcast and visiting other states in an attempt, some say, to raise his national profile. So while many of his critics slam the governor for not focusing enough time and attention on California, how does Newsom spend his time exactly?
It turns out, the answer isn’t so clear, writes CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.
In the past five months, Newsom’s office has not released any of his 2025 calendars, despite doing so in the past and CalMatters requesting them each month. The office has also ignored questions about possible timelines to release the records, which is required by law.
The last calendar his office provided to CalMatters was on April 1, which detailed the months of September through December 2024.
Though these calendars list only official events, which even then are sometimes redacted, they still offer the public the most information about who Newsom is speaking to and how he prioritizes his time.

David Loy, legal director of the First Amendment Coalition: “We’re not talking hundreds and hundreds of records that need to be rounded up and redacted. It’s a pretty straightforward request. This is not difficult — or should not be difficult.”

But it’s only a test, and it will only help a fraction of inmates.","In summary
After years of complaints from inmates and advocates about hot temperatures inside prison cells, California is finally embarking on a plan to cool some cells. But it’s only a test, and it will only help a fraction of inmates. 


As climate change exacerbates the risks of extreme heat across California, the state’s prison officials plan to embark on a $38 million pilot program to figure out how to keep their prison cells cool. 
It comes after years of complaints from prisoners about dangerous temperatures during the state’s brutal summer heat waves, warnings by advocates that the problem will only get worse as the planet warms and the death of an incarcerated woman last year during California’s hottest month on record — which officials from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation insist was unrelated to the heat.
But don’t expect the prisons to become air conditioned anytime soon. 
The pilot, approved by the Legislature this year amid a budget deficit, is a limited test of cooling systems and new insulation over the next four years at just three of the department’s 31 prisons. Results of the test are not expected until mid-2029. 
The corrections department has pointed to the pilot as a step toward addressing the heat problem as it faces pressure from activists, lawmakers and judges to do more. Critics say it falls short, since it only applies to parts of facilities that house about 8,000 of California’s 91,000 inmates and does not require any future concrete action. The department is currently required in a federal court case to protect inmates with mental illness from heat risks, and uses a decades-old protocol to do so. 
With temperatures in some prisons reaching 95 degrees each summer, some prisoners’ advocates say the only safe solution to protect all prisoners is to install air conditioning statewide. 
“Extreme heat poses a serious health risk to all in CDCR,” said Lily Harvey, senior staff attorney at the Prison Law Office, which represents inmates in several federal class-action court cases covering health care in state prisons. “Air-conditioned housing units are the only effective way to protect against that risk.”
But department attorneys have pushed back, arguing in court that some facilities in more temperate areas might not need air conditioning. They have put the price tag of “statewide implementation of effective air cooling mechanisms” at $6 billion, but have refused to provide a cost breakdown of that figure. 
Department officials declined to be interviewed for this story. Instead, in response to a detailed list of questions, department spokesperson Mary Xjimenez sent a written statement saying the heat problem can’t be solved statewide by installing air conditioning alone. For facilities that will need air conditioning, the department will also have to fix corroded roofs and other structural issues. 
The pilot will test different ways — air conditioning, insulation, or some combination of the two — to reduce indoor prison temperatures to 78 degrees at Kern Valley State Prison, Central California Women’s Facility and the California State Prison in Los Angeles County. 
Most prisons currently rely on fans or evaporative cooling units (known commonly as swamp coolers), that have limited effectiveness when temperatures near triple digits. Xjimenez said the department will use the results of the pilot “to recommend a statewide strategy for scaling air cooling in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner.” She pointed to $246 million worth of cooling improvements the department has started at five prisons over the past five years, though not all cover the cells where prisoners are housed.

In the meantime, officials point to what they call their successful heat protocol, required by the court, which they use to monitor inmates who are most at risk of heat illness. From May to October, staff at every prison must record indoor and outdoor temperatures daily, move at-risk inmates indoors and, on the hottest days, check on them every few hours for signs of heat stroke. 
But a monitor for the federal courts this year found gaping holes in its usage, calling consistent implementation of the rules “elusive.” 
At half of the 14 prisons he toured, monitor Matthew Lopes found staff who were unaware of the protocol. He questioned the accuracy of officers’ temperature logs at two prisons; at three, he found broken or missing thermometers. 
While some prison officials “commendably” go out of their way to ease conditions during heat waves, he wrote, others are “failing to approach compliance.”
‘There’s really no reprieve’
Extreme heat is warping life for all Californians, but state prisoners will be hit especially hard.  Many are housed in inland or desert environments where temperatures are slated to rise more than the statewide average over the next few decades.
There were 182 days last year in which at least one of the state’s 31 prisons was experiencing weather hotter than 90 degrees — amounting to half the year, according to a June CDCR report. On 46 days last year, at least one prison was hotter than 95 degrees indoors.

Cal/OSHA only recently began requiring indoor workplaces to be lower than 87 degrees and to provide cooling areas that are no hotter than 82 degrees, but correctional facilities were exempted because of how much it would cost the state to comply. Some experts recommend cooling homes to at most 78 degrees during heat waves to avoid health risks.
CDCR instituted its summer heat protocol under federal court order after three inmates died in their cells of hyperthermia at the California Medical Facility psychiatric prison in Vacaville in 1991. The men, all in their 30s, had been taking psychotropic medications to treat mental illness, which elevate patients’ body temperatures.
Under the protocol, prison staff are required to share a list of inmates who take heat-sensitive medications every summer.
When outdoor temperatures reach 90 degrees, they are supposed to activate Stage 1, moving heat-sensitive inmates indoors. When indoor temperatures reach 90 degrees, they call Stage 2, giving those inmates more access to showers and ice. Indoor temperatures of 95 degrees should trigger Stage 3, during which medical staff are mandated to check on inmates every two hours to monitor for signs of heat illness.
Even outside the cells, heat affects every corner of prison life, the court-appointed monitor Lopes has found. 
Heat forces staff to shuffle counseling to less private spaces, disrupts group therapy and when inmates are forced inside during heat alerts, they sometimes lose out on programs and recreation time to stay in even hotter cells. 
One prisoner at the California Rehabilitation Center in Norco declined to take an antipsychotic medication urged by his psychiatrist because he didn’t want to lose his maintenance job over heat concerns. 
In their housing units, there’s little inmates can do other than take showers and scoop ice when officers provide it. Concrete, uninsulated cells can be as much as 21 degrees hotter than common areas, the department has noted. 
Inmates may keep a personal fan in their cells; it’s available for $27 from the commissary. An inmate with no family support would have to work a minimum-wage prison job for about 4 weeks to afford one, estimates Bharat Venkat, a UCLA anthropologist who has researched the effects of heat on incarcerated people.
Lawrence Cox, an advocate with Legal Services for Prisoners with Children, spent years incarcerated in Calipatria State Prison, in the Imperial County desert and California State Prison Solano, in Vacaville. He and his cellmate would wet their bedsheets in the sink to try to keep cool, but with little ventilation, the cell only became more humid, and he developed heat rashes that he said left lasting marks on his skin.
“I have never sweated so much, continuously, all day, just simply by sitting there,” he said. “There’s really no reprieve.”
The heat protocol’s success depends on who’s on shift. Over the years, the monitor has found inconsistent record-keeping and compliance, according to thousands of pages of court records reviewed by CalMatters. 
Though some facilities are testing digital temperature use, most prison staff maintain outdoor and indoor records on paper, in handwritten logs. A department spokesperson said supervisors are required to verify those records daily. 
Reviewing logs from the Central California Women’s Facility in Madera County obtained through a public records request, CalMatters found days in which prison staff did not record any indoor temperatures. Two days in 2022 the same indoor temperature was recorded at one of the facility’s housing units every three hours for the entire day, in the same handwriting.
A death at California’s largest women’s prison
Every summer, incarcerated women at the Chowchilla prison flood the phone lines of community advocacy groups and attorneys’ offices, raising alarms about hot conditions. About 2,000 women are incarcerated across 15 housing units at the facility, which opened in 1990.
Every summer from 2020 through 2024, Chowchilla saw at least seven days that reached or surpassed 105 degrees; last summer set a record at 28 days.

Adrienne Boulware, who had been incarcerated there for about a decade by 2024, told her family each summer that the prison’s evaporative cooling units weren’t working, said her daughter Michaela Nelson. 
“We were usually worried about her every summer,” Nelson said. 
Even driving through the Central Valley to visit Boulware felt “treacherous” because of the heat, Nelson said. The family had helped her buy a fan for her cell, and she took showers to cool off, but in phone calls to her daughters in the summer of 2024, Boulware described the prison as “hot as hell.”
Boulware raised Nelson and three siblings in Sacramento. She was serving a 15 years-to-life sentence for second-degree murder in the 2011 beating death of a man she and another woman argued with in an abandoned car wash in north Sacramento. Nelson said her mother had been steadily repaying her debt to society, taking classes and running a Bible study. In recent years Boulware had started going to parole hearings, so her family was hoping for her release. Nelson, a home care worker in Georgia, planned to move back to California.
Like much of the state, Chowchilla was three days into a searing two-week heat wave during last year’s long Independence Day weekend when Boulware, 47, collapsed.

On July 4, when temperatures were as high as 109 degrees outside, the swamp cooler in Boulware’s building was “blowing warm air but was fixed the same day,” CDCR attorney Melissa Bentz wrote in an email later included in court records. Staff placed coolers of ice water and “large industrial floor fans” in the housing units. 
On July 5, outside temperatures reached 108. A lieutenant at the prison told the Madera County Sheriff’s Office that Boulware, who court records say was prescribed the mood stabilizer lithium, was “outside in the yard most of the day,” according to a coroner’s report. After they returned inside, dorm-mates found Boulware on the floor of the shower. 
Officers were unsure if she was having a seizure or overdose. She was given four rounds of Narcan and taken to a hospital in Merced, where she died early the next morning. 
Amid a public outcry in the days that followed, department spokespeople downplayed the role of heat in Boulware’s death, telling reporters it “appears to be the result of an ongoing medical condition and not heat-related.” 
A toxicology report showed fentanyl was found in her blood. The Madera County coroner this year listed the cause of death as undetermined.
Experts say it can often be hard to identify heat as a cause in deaths and medical events, especially when people have other health conditions. 
Advocates and Boulware’s family believe her death was preventable. Records show the department itself suspected heat from the beginning. 
In prison staff’s first phone call to Boulware’s family before she was taken to the hospital on July 5, Nelson said, they told her sister she had suffered a heat stroke. In an email to plaintiffs’ attorneys and the court monitor a few days after the death, a prison medical provider wrote that the causes of death were listed as loss of consciousness, seizures, “heat stroke and possible overdose.” The email was included in court records.

An alarmed plaintiffs’ attorney, Steven Fama, wrote to the court monitor on July 8 asking for an investigation. Citing Boulware’s prison medical records, Fama noted her body temperature was 41.5 degrees Celsius when she arrived at the hospital — 106.7 degrees Fahrenheit, eight degrees higher than the normal human body temperature. 
He also raised more questions: Why, he wrote, was an inmate who was prescribed the heat-sensitive medication lithium “outside all day” during a triple-digit heat wave?
Nelson said her family is still waiting for an answer. They also haven’t received her mother’s belongings — years of letters, photographs, everything the family bought her from the prison commissary and her mother’s Bible. Asked by CalMatters for comment, CDCR said it is following department procedures for returning Boulware’s belongings. Officials declined to comment on her death, deferring to the coroner’s report.   
“It’s hard to not know,” Nelson said. “It’s always better to know than to just be wondering, wondering if she suffered, and how things could have been different.”
Increasing pressure on the state
Seven months after Boulware died, in February of this year, court-appointed prison monitor Matthew Lopes wrote that her death was a “tragic reminder of the very real harm that can result from failing to properly monitor and treat patients on heat-sensitive medication.” 
But corrections department attorneys urged him not to include that in his report evaluating CDCR’s heat protocol. In court records, staff attorney Nick Weber called it “charged language,” noting that, as of this spring, the coroner had not yet documented an official cause of death.
Since Boulware’s death a year ago, advocates have used the incident to demand that CDCR do more to protect incarcerated people. 
Earlier this year, activists pleaded with the Cal/OSHA standards board to adopt a promised new workplace standard for state prisons. They argued that many prison inmates work in the facilities, whether in kitchens, facility maintenance, or as part of state programs that place inmates in jobs with private contractors. 
Any new rule would require a drafting and public hearings process which can take years. Spokespeople for both the department and the Cal/OSHA board said they are in “discussions” about a rule, but no public process has begun.
Cox’s group, Legal Services for Prisoners with Children, sponsored a bill this year that would have forced the state to lower temperatures in all the prisons and require digitized, live temperature monitoring. The bill sailed through state Assembly committees and didn’t garner any official opposition. 
But with the corrections department estimating it would cost between $10 billion and $20 billion to make the changes, author Assemblymember Celeste Rodriguez said she knew it would be a tough sell amid a budget deficit. Rodriguez, a Democrat from Chino, agreed to hold it and revisit it next year. 
She said she’s encouraged by the pilot program the department is starting, but wants to keep the legislation alive so officials don’t lose urgency to address the heat. 
“Managing litigation costs is a factor when we consider infrastructure projects,” she said of the potential cost of installing air conditioning across prisons. 
Meanwhile, in a class action federal court case on medical care in California prisons, plaintiffs representing virtually every prisoner in the state have sought to bring heat issues before a judge.
They’ve pointed to a case in Texas in which a judge ruled in March that the lack of systemwide air conditioning there violates constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment. 
The department has objected to the comparison. Unlike Texas, attorneys for the CDCR wrote in June, California prisons have experienced “very few sentinel events (such as deaths) among its patient population directly related to extreme heat.” 
But in California, U.S. District Judge Jon S. Tigar has expressed interest in the issue, and directed the department to provide the plaintiffs data on the matter.
“I want to say this very clearly, this is a medical issue,” he said in a June conference with attorneys on all sides. “This is a big issue, that’s only going to get bigger with the passage of time.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/061824-Chowchilla-Womens-Prison-GETTY-CM-01-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-04 08:56:49.398067

His official schedule remains a mystery,Alexei Koseff,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/09/gavin-newsom-calendars-transparency/,"As Gov. Gavin Newsom turns his attention to national politics, it’s difficult to evaluate what effect his extracurricular activities have had on his work, because the governor’s office has not made his full schedule available all year.","In summary
As Gov. Gavin Newsom turns his attention to national politics, it’s difficult to evaluate what effect his extracurricular activities have had on his work, because the governor’s office has not made his full schedule available all year.


It’s a common refrain for critics of Gov. Gavin Newsom: Focus on your job.
The jabs have grown louder this year as Newsom launched a new weekly political podcast and traveled to other states that could be pivotal in a potential presidential campaign. A poll in May found that twice as many California voters believe the governor is devoting more attention to boosting his national profile than fixing the problems of the state.
“If he wants to prove to the United States that he would be a good president, why doesn’t he start by leading and actually running the state of California?” then-Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli, who has since been appointed a U.S. attorney, said in a March appearance on Fox News.
But it’s difficult to evaluate what effect Newsom’s extracurricular activities have had on his work, because the governor’s office has not made his full schedule available all year.
Each month, CalMatters requests Newsom’s calendar under the California Public Records Act. While the governor’s office routinely released those documents in the past, it has not provided anything new in five months and has yet to hand over any of his 2025 calendars.
Multiple inquiries about a timeline for releasing the records, a requirement under the law, have been ignored during that period. Representatives for the governor’s legal affairs unit, which handles records requests, wrote that the calendars “will be provided as soon as they are ready for release.”
Newsom’s spokesperson did not respond to questions about what is causing the delay, but said in an email Wednesday that the calendars would be provided when they are “finalized and ready for public disclosure.”
“Governor Newsom has been among the most transparent governors in California’s history and we’ll continue to share his calendar, as always, with the transparency, diligence, and accuracy it deserves,” spokesperson Izzy Gardon wrote. He added, “I look forward to reading your webpost about the hardships you’ve encountered while waiting.”
“This is not difficult — or should not be difficult.”David Loy, legal director of the First Amendment Coalition
David Loy, legal director of the First Amendment Coalition, which advocates for government transparency, said it’s “deeply problematic” that the governor’s office has not quickly fulfilled what amounts to a simple clerical task.
“We’re not talking hundreds and hundreds of records that need to be rounded up and redacted. It’s a pretty straightforward request,” Loy said. “This is not difficult — or should not be difficult.”
A fight for public access
California governors have shared their calendars for about two decades.
Previously, Gov. George Deukmejian went to court to protect those records from disclosure, arguing that making his appointments public would discourage people from meeting with him and hinder his decision-making process. The California Supreme Court ruled in his favor in 1991.
Then California voters expanded the Public Records Act in 2004, ultimately compelling then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to begin releasing his calendar. During Gov. Jerry Brown’s subsequent tenure, his office proactively provided his appointments log monthly to reporters who made standing public records requests.
The schedules are of limited utility, because they include only official events, not personal or political activities, and even those are sometimes redacted to protect attorney-client privilege or the governor’s security. Newsom’s calendars from previous years include many days with just a few meetings or no official events listed at all, and the hours are often filled with “work time,” providing no further details.
But because most of the governor’s other records, including emails, remain legally protected from disclosure, calendars offer the public the most comprehensive picture available of who Newsom is speaking to and how he is prioritizing his time. That means their release can still be politically fraught, and numerous administrations have resisted going beyond the minimum requirements.
“It would be so much better for transparency if they just posted his calendar online,” Loy said.
Calendars not produced ‘promptly’
The governor’s office last provided Newsom’s calendars to CalMatters on April 1, for the months of September through December 2024.
When a request is made under the California Public Records Act, government agencies are required to determine within 10 business days whether they have any disclosable documents and, if so, provide an estimated delivery date. The agencies are then supposed to produce the records “promptly,” which is not a defined time frame.
The law also obligates that records be produced as they existed at the time of the request.
The calendars that Newsom’s office has released in the past are PDF files that simply list his schedule in chronological order: date, time, a brief description of the appointment, location and staff lead.
The entries appear to be copied over from a calendar program into a text file, which Loy said is concerning, because the law requires that electronic records are provided in their native format, for proper accountability.
“The whole point of transparency law is ‘trust but verify,’” he said. “We don’t have to take their word that they’re doing it right. We can see it for ourselves.”
Newsom’s spokespeople did not respond to questions about how the governor’s calendar is maintained and in what format.
The delay echoes a similar issue involving Newsom’s tax returns. While they are not a public record, Newsom pledged to be the first California governor to release his filings every year while in office. But he has not done so in more than three years, last sharing a tax return in March 2022, as he was running for re-election.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/082125_Redistricting-Newsom_MG_CM_14.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-04 08:56:49.398067

Scott Wiener that would clear the way for construction of apartment buildings near transit stops in California, most pointedly including Los Angeles: It’s a bad idea, and Los Angeles has only itself to blame for it.
The fact that Wiener’s approach is both wrongheaded and entirely understandable has led to some strange reactions in California’s largest city, where unusual bedfellows have found themselves together either supporting or opposing it. A bare majority of a city council normally divided between liberals and democratic socialists came together to formally oppose the bill, the eight no votes drawing from both political camps. Supporters similarly crossed ideological lines.
Mayor Karen Bass also opposed Wiener’s bill, positing a brief statement. “While I support the intent to accelerate housing development statewide,” she said, “as written, this bill risks unintended consequences for LA.” 
She was joined by her once and possibly future opponent, developer Rick Caruso, who echoed Bass’ ambivalence as well as her conclusion. 
“The state is right to encourage more housing,” he said, “but it must be done with the full engagement and support of local officials and residents.”
It’s tempting to dismiss those as NIMBY responses, those of local leaders defending their turf against the wiser heads of state government. That’s a little bit true, but mostly not. 
Wiener’s bill violates the most basic principles of social organization and American federalism. It substitutes far-away authority for local expertise. It treats neighborhoods not as places where people live and work but as dots on a map. It’s an expression of ego rather than planning.
As Ruth Galanter, a revered former L.A. City Council member, told me last week, “There’s a difference between making policy and solving problems.”
SB 79 runs afoul of the principle of subsidiarity, which argues that problems should be solved at the most local level achievable. Families understand their problems better than neighbors, communities are better at directing their futures than cities, and so on.
The same is true for government. Indeed, a prime violator of that idea is President Donald Trump, who has decided that he — and he alone — understands the best ways to bring safety to Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Chicago and elsewhere. The result is chaos and stupidity, hallmarks of the Trump regime, with National Guard troops and Marines camped out in Los Angeles for weeks doing nothing and now spreading mulch in Washington, all in service of a dim, tyrannical ego.
Wiener is well-intentioned and his bill more intelligent, but it fails for the same reasons as Trump’s actions: It substitutes far-away authority for local insight. It assumes that Sacramento knows better than Los Angeles what is best for the city and its neighborhoods.
It doesn’t. The state government does not know where to put an apartment building in mid-Wilshire or Hancock Park, any more than it does in San Francisco’s Mission or Bakersfield’s Oakridge. 
To cite Galanter, Wiener’s bill makes policy but it doesn’t solve problems.
Still, hammers will see nails, and supporters of Wiener’s approach aren’t wrong to demand change. California needs more housing, and that’s especially true in Los Angeles, which needs to produce more than 387,000 units by 2029 to meet its state-mandated quota. And that was before the fires in January. 
It’s a familiar problem and one that reflects the state’s persistent popularity, despite its challenges. California remains an attractive place to live for more Americans than any other state in the Union. That creates problems of demand.
Indeed, it’s been in this fix before. At the end of World War II, veterans and their families came streaming to California to reset their lives. Then-Gov. Earl Warren used to say that it was his responsibility to provide for 10,000 arrivals every month.
And at this moment, Los Angeles is falling behind. Studies suggest that the city is some 270,000 short of affordable units to serve its population, and progress toward that place has been dismayingly slow. L.A. issued roughly 17,000 permits last year, the lowest mark in three years.
Cities don’t build housing, but cities can make it easier or harder for developers to do so, and Los Angeles has often made it harder by complicating permits and imposing regulations — many well-intentioned to protect neighborhoods, require parking and control traffic, among other things, but sometimes so onerous that they make the cost prohibitive. 
Developers are under no obligation to build. They can, and do, go elsewhere.
Even as the city has made modest gains in addressing homelessness, the broader housing shortage remains, a reminder that those two struggles, though related, also are distinct. Building new apartment buildings along rail or bus lines, as Wiener’s approach would facilitate, does not do much for the destitute person living under a bridge. Even if clearing the way for more apartments would nudge down the average price of a place to live in the city, it now hovers at around $2,800 a month, orders of magnitude beyond the reach of most of those living in tents or cars. 
The market — even aided by the state government — is not going to solve that problem.

Wiener’s bill, then, is unlikely to help alleviate homelessness, but it’s an understandable response to a stubborn problem. Los Angeles will continue to invite outside intervention unless and until it uncorks housing growth. Some of that will be by accepting increased density in certain neighborhoods, not because Sacramento ordered it but because Bass and the city council affirmatively do it themselves.
And here is where L.A.’s leadership can both maintain its authority and deter the state from unwise intervention. It can green-light smart proposals for denser housing in areas already suited for it — the Wilshire Corridor, major arteries, commercial areas in the San Fernando Valley and South Los Angeles, Westwood, Hollywood. In those areas, it can streamline permitting, remove delays and overly burdensome regulations. 
It can commit to housing growth, not because it’s the answer to homelessness but because it’s a genuine problem all on its own.
But it should not assume that all neighborhoods are the same. It should not commit the mistake that Wiener’s bill does. It should consider the history and character of neighborhoods, not just treat them as dots on a map.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/080719_LosAngeles_AW_CM_61.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-04 08:56:49.398067

On a quiet Sunday morning at Seaside Park in Bridgeport, waves roll steadily against the shore as a group of women gathers near a single wooden bench. The only green bench in the park, it has become more than just a place to sit. It is the heart of a sisterhood called Sisters at the Shore, women who meet to pray, reflect and care for one another and their city.
The founder, Thayer Barkley, says it began with a vision. She recalls being awakened between 3 and 5 a.m. night after night, unsure why she could not rest. “I was really asking God, what do you want from me? Why do you keep waking me up?” she said.
What followed was an image she could not ignore. “I basically had a vision of women gathered lining the shores. Not just this shore, but shores across the nation, across the world.” Unsure where it might lead, she posted a question on Facebook: how many other women were being awakened at that time? The responses poured in. Women said, “me, me, me,” and from there, a movement was born.
Faith guided Barkley to act. “I never really spent time with a lot of women. It was always conflict and drama. I didn’t want to deal with it. So I knew that was God telling me to do this,” she said. Following instructions she says were placed in her heart, she brought a drum, prayed silently by the water and let the rest unfold. “It was about coming and speaking to God. In silence. Letting the water hold our prayers.”
The first gathering was small. Friends shared the invitation, word spread and soon the circle widened. As word of the group’s impact grew, Barkley was invited to workshops and beaches across the country and abroad to share what Sisters at the Shore was doing in Bridgeport. That’s how the prayers at Seaside Park spread to places like Chicago, North Carolina and even Italy. “I sounded the drum there and people came from every direction. And we prayed by that water. It has happened in so many places, and I know there will be more,” she said.

For Barkley, the connection to water is spiritual and rooted in her upbringing. “My father was from North Carolina. My mother from Virginia. We are Blackfoot and Cherokee by blood. We were taught about nature, about the water and the skies and God. Not necessarily in a religious upbringing, but to honor God through nature. Water is life. Without water, there is no life. Man can try to duplicate many things but not the water. The cleansing, the power, the way it can move rocks and change formations. That same power can change our lives.”
Every Sunday, the women begin in silence, sending prayers out toward the water. They do not recite the same words or follow one faith tradition. Barkley made it clear the circle was never meant to be exclusive. “I didn’t want it to be about one faith, one race, not even one gender. God said gather the women, but He also said men would come. Jewish, Muslim, Catholic, Christian — we learn from each other. The central goal is love.”
The inclusivity drew longtime Bridgeport resident Lori Caple to the shore. “I felt that unity and warmth and love. They accepted me, and I embraced it,” she said. For Caple, the power of the gathering is in both prayer and action. “Anything in the community that we can do, we do. From gun violence to food drives. The prayer is powerful. I’m grateful for the sisters.” She described bonding with an elder in the group who reminded her of her mother, a friendship rooted in care and wisdom.
Barbara Pouchet Griffin is also a Bridgeport resident. She arrived laughing. “I didn’t even know where to go on the beach. The ladies all had a chuckle out of that,” she said. But she returned not just for camaraderie. “I used to go to church, and I got my family into church, but to see how genuine the people are here is different. A lot of women go to other shores, but I come back because our silent prayers really work. We pray for our city, our country, our state, our family and friends. We welcome everyone, no matter race or religion. These ladies have become my sisters. God put us on this mission. We are in communities dealing with domestic violence, with seniors, with men. It’s an amazing group, all from one post that said, ‘meet me at the shore.’”

Denese Taylor-Moye, a City Council member in Bridgeport and one of the elders of Sisters at the Shore, said the gatherings are about unity. “We are still navigating through everything, but we have grown and learned just by looking at the water. Us. Just how united we are,” she said.
Beth Lazar resides near downtown Bridgeport and emphasized belonging and service. “The group gives me an opportunity to serve the community,” she said, recalling handing out gloves and scarves to people without shelter. “We’ve done retreats, school giveaways. It is belonging, but also action.”
Nicole Bass Adams has been living in Bridgeport for more than a decade and added, “We’re a sisterhood. We have a sense of community. It’s not just one side. We care about the city of Bridgeport — everyone, homeless, children, moms, people affected by violence.”
Bridgeport itself holds deep significance for Barkley. Raised in the city, she knows its struggles and reputation. “I see the trauma of Bridgeport and the bad rap that we get. I just want to show people there’s more, that we matter, that we’re important.” Choosing Seaside Park was intentional. Barkley sought permission from a tribal mother of the Golden Hill Paugussett tribe, acknowledging the land as having an ancestral and sacred history. “As a Native American, we are very careful not to go into someone’s ancestral area without acknowledging it. This honors the land. I’ll thank the water, I’ll thank the trees, I’ll thank the sky. Because I believe it all has memory.”

The green bench where the women gather is woven into that sacredness. “I’m not sure how this section was picked, it just happened,” Barkley said. “But this is where our elders sit. And elders are very important. Their wisdom is unmatchable, their presence sacred. This is not your ordinary bench. Why did they spare this bench? Why is it the only wood one in the park? And why did we pick it without even knowing that? Now the women are asking, let’s make it a Sisters at the Shore bench, because what started here is going across the world.”
Barkley believes any recognition of the bench should honor the Golden Hill Paugussett tribe. “It’s about acknowledgment. We get to sit here because they were here. It would also symbolize our faithfulness. I’ve been doing this for five years. Rain, snow, sleet. We’ve only missed maybe two or three times. Even if they close the parks, we walk in. Women say this is the most special 20 minutes of their week.”
The gatherings have expanded into workshops addressing trauma, purpose and healing. Barkley notes that many people do not realize they carry trauma because they are too busy surviving. “A lot of people are not breathing. Their breathing is shallow. Your body can cleanse and heal when you take conscious breaths. Stop, breathe, get clarity and then sit still and wait for God to answer.” 
The workshops cover everything from finding purpose to navigating grief. “It’s about giving people an outlet and also teaching them, you can do this too. I don’t want to always be the face. I want people to walk into their own. If your gift is baking a cake, bake the best cake and let that be your purpose.”

Healing the community, Barkley says, begins with individuals walking in purpose. “Once you’re walking in your purpose, you won’t be sad, depressed, or envious. You’ll be happier. And if you’re that way most of the time, we are all going to be better. It has to start within in order to reach others.” She emphasizes modeling that for children. “The children are watching us. They come in with joy, and us as traumatized adults often dampen that. But if we encourage them, if we support them, we can heal ourselves too. Everything has a purpose. That’s what I want people to learn.”
The dream for Sisters at the Shore stretches far beyond Bridgeport. Barkley envisions synchronized prayer around the world, women and men gathered by lakes, waterfalls and oceans every Sunday morning, sending prayers into the water. She has already seen it begin in Chicago, Italy, Florida, California and Kentucky. “What started here in Bridgeport is now in other cities and other countries. The dream is for every natural body of water to be a place where prayer and healing take place.”
The women also take their work beyond the beach. They organize community cleanups, host wellness workshops and support local schools. “It’s not just about prayer. It’s about action,” Barkley said. “If we see someone struggling, we step in. We find ways to serve, and it all starts with that connection by the water.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_7661-1024x735.jpg,,,2025-09-04 08:56:49.398067

A recent analysis found that the state spent $5 billion in five years on the Alabama Department of Corrections. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A report published last month estimated that Alabama spent $5 billion on the state’s prison system in the past five years.
The report from Alabama Appleseed, a criminal justice organization, said the total included ADOC paid for operations and the costs of a $1.3 billion new prison in Elmore County, including debt payments for the bonds the state issued to assist with the construction costs, contributed to the total.
“What came as a bit of a surprise was the trajectory over 20 years, and how the increase in prison spending has caused this ripple effect where these other important agencies, their budgets are not growing at the same rate,” said Carla Crowder, executive director of Alabama Appleseed.

A message was sent to the ADOC on Tuesday seeking comment.
Corrections for decades has taken the second-largest chunk out of the state’s General Fund budget, only trailing Alabama Medicaid, which provides health insurance to about 1 million Alabamians, mostly children, elderly people or those with disabilities. The department is budgeted to get $826.7 million in the current fiscal year, about 22% of the total General Fund.
“That is why we have budget hearings, to get a grasp of the direction that we are headed and, more importantly, why,” said Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, the chair of the Senate in an interview on Tuesday.
He cited several factors for the increase in money allocated to ADOC.
“We are trying to hire people is the first thing,” he said. “The second thing is construction, and the third thing is lawsuits. I think those are three things where money gets sucked up in.”
Corrections has struggled to maintain adequate staffing in the prisons, a major contributor to a wave of violence in the state’s correctional facilities. The state has paid tens of millions of dollars in legal fees over litigation.
The Elmore County prison has proven far more expensive than legislators first expected. Lawmakers approved $1.3 billion for two prisons in 2021, expecting that to cover the cost of the Elmore facility and another prison in Escambia. Now, that amount is enough for only one prison.
Legislators have authorized transferring money from ADOC operations to help pay for the expected cost of the second prison planned for Escambia County. The Legislature has also authorized additional bonding capacity in 2025 should additional funding be needed.
However, legislators also allocate a greater share of the General Fund budget to the ADOC as the cost to operate the state’s prisons has increased dramatically in the past several years.
The Alabama Department of Mental Health, for example, received $244 million, or almost 8% of the General Fund dollars, for the current fiscal year, roughly a fourth of what ADOC was allocated. Another agency, the Alabama Department of Public Health, will receive about $160 million, almost 3% of the General Fund budget.
Agencies have other funds from which to draw, but the General Fund comprises a significant portion of their budgets.
Medicaid and Corrections’ share of the budget have grown significantly over the last 20 years. In 2002, they were responsible for about a third of the spending. By 2024 it increased to slightly more than half.
Medicaid went from $231 million in 2002 to $955 million in 2025, a 313% increase. Corrections went from $197 million to $737 million, an increase of 274% over the same period.
Crowder said part of the reason for the increased funding is meant to address years of underinvestment in the prison system. The additional allocations also deal with the problems that ADOC currently has recruiting and retaining corrections officers and the medical costs because of an aging prison population.
A higher percentage of people in Alabama’s prisons are expected to spend a greater share of their lives incarcerated in prison.
A study from The Sentencing Project published in 2024, a research and advocacy organization, said that almost 30% of people in state prison are practically serving a life sentence, meaning they will spend decades incarcerated before possibly getting released. This is compared to the national percentage at 16%.
“When you are sentencing a lot of people to life, that is a dramatic way of increasing the prison population numbers,” said Nazgol Ghandnoosh, director of research at The Sentencing Project.
As they age, their medical needs increase along with the corresponding costs.
“The best way to curb these costs is to evaluate older people who are serving unnecessary and extreme sentences, then rehabilitate and find pathways to release,” Crowder said. “To increase the availability of Medicaid for people who are leaving prison, other states have done this through a waiver program. And to invest more in front-end solutions like mental health care and drug treatment.”
There are limits for how much states can decrease the cost of incarcerating people solely by releasing some of those who are incarcerated.
“That is partly because the main significant way to experience savings in correctional costs is to shut down facilities or large sections of facilities,” Ghandnoosh said. “Just reducing the number of people and leaving the number of prisons the same doesn’t lower cost because every year you are going to have likely increases in staffing costs and so on.”
Some states, to reduce costs, are beginning to close facilities.
“By building a new facility and expanding capacity, that is likely going to result in prosecutorial decisions, legislative decisions, to fill up those prison beds,” she said.
The state, for its part, said the new facilities will not add new capacity to the system, but simply replace the capacity at other facilities slated to be closed. However, some lawmakers, like Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, are starting to doubt if those facilities can close given the increase in the prison population.
Appleseed has been urging the Legislature to pass a bill for the past several years to allow judges to reconsider the sentences of people who spent decades in prison, and who did not cause any physical harm during their offenses.
Appleseed published its findings just as the Legislature received an update on the status of both the Educational Trust Fund and General Fund budgets prior to the start of the 2026 session in January.
ADOC was scheduled to appear before the Legislature last week as part of the budget hearings, but the appearance was cancelled. Despite that, Albritton said in an interview on Tuesday that he spoke with ADOC Commissioner John Hamm.
“I don’t see the increases continuing to develop,” he said. “I think we have gotten pretty close to the level of what the needs are. We seem to have gotten the pay scales up to a point that is making a difference, and gives us an opportunity to retain people.”
For Albritton, the key to bending the cost curve will be the construction of the new facility because the sources of increased expenses stem from problems with infrastructure.
“It does not cure all of our problems, but it will remove the threat and the aspect of several lawsuits that is on us right now and the cost that is associated with that,” he said. “It will also give us a means to control the violence better in the prisons themselves, and reduce the number of incidents there. It will also protect the corrections officers more and it will give us the facilities to maintain them, so just don’t ignore them and let them deteriorate.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prison-inmate-1024x647.jpg,,,2025-09-04 08:56:49.398067

Those service outages are exacerbated by a federal rule that caps the number of spare buses a transit agency can maintain at 20% of their overall bus fleet, regardless of how many more buses a transit service needs to maintain reliable service.
Transit agencies that keep more spare buses than allowed risk losing federal funding if they aren’t granted an exemption from the Federal Transit Authority (FTA) for additional spare buses. However, the federal agency has never granted a waiver for additional buses to any state.
Southern Nevada’s congressional delegation is now asking the FTA to remove or increase its cap on the number of spare buses the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (RTC) can maintain in Las Vegas.
Southern Nevada’s transit authority operates a fleet of over 400 buses and relies on FTA funding to purchase both active and spare buses, but federal limits on spare buses have strained operations.
In a letter Thursday Democratic U.S. Sens. Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto – along with Reps. Susie Lee, Steven Horsford, and Dina Titus – said “transit agencies across the country face a variety of operational and environmental challenges that often require maintaining spare bus ratios above the current 20% cap.”
“Las Vegas, like many western cities, experiences extreme heat that accelerates bus wear and increases breakdown frequency, requiring more frequent maintenance to keep vehicles operational. This puts significant strain on RTC’s fleet, as insufficient spares can lead to service disruptions for the approximately 80 percent of Las Vegas riders who rely on transit for commuting to work,” wrote the delegation.
High transit demand and the extreme desert climate leads to rapid wear and tear on buses in Las Vegas, especially for high-mileage buses operating routes with long hours. 
Unlike many other cities, tourism and a non-traditional workforce in Las Vegas creates high peak demand for transit service throughout the day, with some routes operating 24 hours daily.
Asphalt in the city can also reach temperatures of more than 140 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer, according to the RTC, increasing maintenance needs for buses traveling on hot roads throughout the entire day and reducing the fleet’s availability.
Frequent special events that attract thousands of tourists at a time also complicates bus management, placing further strain on an already stretched fleet. 
Conventions and sporting events frequently create a surge in ridership that requires more spare buses to provide reliable transit, said the RTC.
“Las Vegas’s vibrant tourism economy depends on reliable transit service to transport millions of visitors, not just year-round residents, especially during major events such as the Super Bowl, Formula 1 Grand Prix, FIFA tournaments, and large concerts,” wrote the delegation. 
Southern Nevada’s transit authority said they have worked to address frequent breakdowns in their fleet by prioritizing preventative maintenance, including regularly performing cooling system checks and addressing common wear-and-tear issues like battery and alternator failures exacerbated by the intense heat. 
But more flexibility on spare buses allowed in a fleet is needed so “agencies like RTC of Southern Nevada to better maintain reliable, safe, and equitable service for their communities,” reads the letter.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/RTC-Transit-CNG-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-04 08:56:49.398067
,California,2025-09-04 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,New California law to make housing projects easier can also make them cost more,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/california-new-housing-law-projects/,"The legislation removes environmental delays but includes language that could allow local governments to add ""vehicle miles traveled"" fees to a project's cost.","Two months ago, Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislators from both parties celebrated enacting landmark legislation to remove the California Environmental Quality Act as an impediment to new housing construction.
Lopsided votes in the Legislature for Assembly Bill 130 and Newsom’s immediate signature seemingly ended decades of debate over how the environmental law, signed by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan more than 50 years ago, was being used to delay or kill residential developments.
“Saying ‘no’ to housing in my community will no longer be state sanctioned,” said Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat who has long advocated for CEQA reform. “This isn’t going to solve all of our housing problems in the state, but it is going to remove the single biggest impediment to building environmentally friendly housing.”
Newsom took obvious pleasure in achieving what had eluded other governors, including predecessor Jerry Brown, who once described overhauling CEQA as “the lord’s work.”
As Newsom signed the measure into law he thanked legislators and housing, labor and environmental leaders “who heeded my call and came together around a common goal — to build more housing faster and create strong, affordable pathways for every Californian.
“Today’s bill is a game changer which will be felt for generations to come,” he said. 
While AB130 does remove CEQA as a weapon for labor unions and opponents of high-density projects to stall construction, there’s a provision buried in the lengthy bill that could create a new impediment.
Two sections, 137 pages in, declare that if a residential project has “significant transportation impact,” local governments or regional agencies can impose fees to “mitigate the transportation impact to a less than significant level by helping to fund or otherwise facilitating vehicle miles traveled-efficient affordable housing or related infrastructure projects….”
The so-called vehicle miles traveled, or VMT, fees are “a new housing tax families simply cannot afford,” the California Building Industry Association publicly complained, adding that impact fees are already major factors in housing costs.
Local traffic impact fees are not new. In fact, a dispute over a $23,420 traffic mitigation fee imposed nine years ago for a factory-built house in El Dorado County is still pending after going all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
However, AB 130 appears to broaden the potential use of these fees not only for roadway improvements, but also to pay for low-income housing projects throughout the state by contributing to the state’s Transit-Oriented Development Implementation Fund.
Drafting AB 130’s CEQA language was a complex process involving multiple stakeholders, not only housing advocates but environmental groups that often employ CEQA to slow or kill major public and private developments and labor unions, which have used the threat of CEQA lawsuits to compel developers to use union workers. The latter issue was a major hang-up that required last-minute amendments to the measure.
The language about traffic fees was never mentioned in analyses of the bill nor in the debates that preceded legislative passage. It’s another example of how such budget trailer bills are used by governors and legislators to enact major legislation on the sly, with little or no public airing of the issues.
Trailer bills often contain language that has little or nothing to do with the budget and are often fleshed out just hours before enactment. Under the guise of being budget-related, the bills can be passed with simple majority floor votes, take effect immediately upon being signed by the governor and cannot be taken to voters via referendum.
Those factors make trailer bills convenient vehicles for legislation that might not survive close scrutiny. Newsom has been especially willing to utilize them for his legislative priorities.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/092222-LA-TRANSIT-TRAIN-REUTERS-MB-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C718&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-04 08:56:49.398067

Leo, a New York native with family ties to Mississippi, just completed a 12-week fellowship at Mississippi Today, where he deeply covered criminal justice, education and culture. He holds degrees from Columbia University in American Studies and Investigative Journalism, and his work appears in the Christian Science Monitor and at Byline.

Leonardo Bevilacqua
Before becoming a journalist, he taught high school English in Indianola, Leland, and Jackson, and worked in nonprofit after-school enrichment programs in Clarksdale and Cleveland. He also directed community theater with the Delta Arts Alliance.
“The phrase ‘hit the ground running’ is trite but seems no better description for Leo,” said Debbie Skipper, Mississippi Today’s Justice Editor. “From the moment he joined our investigative team as a summer fellow from Columbia University, he has kept a pace that is truly remarkable, gleaning insights from Mississippians across the state dealing with real issues like childcare access and affordability, crime victim compensation, undocumented workers, teacher pay and local school control. He never just speaks to officials. As he takes on his new role, Mississippi couldn’t ask for a better journalist to report the stories that touch the lives of everyday Mississippians.”
Leo will serve on Mississippi Today’s newly formed Education Team, which is dedicated to covering all aspects of the state’s education system with a special focus on the challenges and solutions in Mississippi schools that can engage youth and strengthen communities.
The reporting on areas of educational pathways, funding and postsecondary opportunities will be produced in Mississippi Today’s signature style — in-depth, with attention to background and context. This will include a mix of daily news and longer-form pieces involving investigation and data analysis, with a special focus on schools and families in the Mississippi Delta.
That Delta focus makes Leo uniquely qualified for this job.
“I’m humbled to be reporting on a region where I began my professional career as a teacher,”  Bevilacqua said. “The Delta deserves high-impact, accountability journalism. I look forward to  joining a team of journalists I’ve long revered.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/04185133/MT-Featured-Image-General-Logo.jpg,,,2025-09-04 08:56:49.398067

The increase is due to inflated medical and pharmaceutical costs. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Public Education Employee Health Insurance Plan (PEEHIP) board approved a request for a $380 million budget increase for fiscal year 2027 at its quarterly meeting Wednesday.
Diane Scott, chief financial officer for PEEHIP, presented a financial update to the board, which included a proposal to increase the state’s share from $904 per member per month to $1,209. With the increase, the board’s request for funding from the Legislature in January will be $1.509 billion. In FY26, the Legislature funded $1.129 billion through the Education Trust Fund.
The Legislature will make the final decision on the request and other budget matters in its 2026 regular session, which begins in January. 
Scott attributed the increase to health care costs. She said medical and pharmaceutical costs are up 16.55% from July 2024 to July 2025. She said she expects the costs to continue to rise over the next three fiscal years.
“Every year, we’re looking at a minimum increase in our cost of $100 million and that’s what this projection shows,” Scott said. “We have to be able to cover, every year, an incremental increase, unless there’s something out of the ordinary that is going to get those costs down.”
Alabama State Finance Director Bill Poole noted that the Legislature approved an increase of coverage for PEEHIP members this spring from $800 per member per month to $904 instead of giving teachers a pay raise.
“I think from the Legislature’s perspective, I would anticipate they will view this as ‘We just gave the largest year over year increase for PEEHIP in a long period of time,’” Poole said. “That will not be lost to the extent the Legislature did not give raises for FY26. I think it would be prudent to anticipate that they will want to provide raises in FY27. It shouldn’t be lost on anybody within the political context, that it’s going to be an election year for the Legislature.”
The ETF also has a spending cap, which Poole said would impact PEEHIP. Health care cost increases are not unique to PEEHIP, he said. 
“It’s not unique to public health care systems. It’s not unique to the private section of health care,” Poole said. “There’s not an American in this country that is going to be insulated from this type of inflationary costs occurring across our health insurance sector, whether they’re privately insured or publicly insured.”
The board approved the increased budget request. John Whaley, the chair of the PEEHIP board, said he is worried about premium increases that would come with the overall budget increase.
“Looking at the salary schedule in our school system, a cafeteria worker, bus driver, makes $18,000 a year. If you raise their PEEHIP rate from $307 to $614 they’re down to $886 before you take out Social Security, retirement and so on. So now they’re down to $400 a month,” Whaley said. “There aren’t enough bus drivers. Now, when you raise that bus drivers’ rate from $307 to $614 a month, we won’t be able to find any at all.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-design-e1756930754335-1024x563.png,,,2025-09-04 08:56:49.398067

Protecting Vermonters means strengthening communities and homes while letting forests function naturally, supporting both ecosystem and climate resilience.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jennifer Mamola: ‘Fix Our Forests Act’ misrepresents wildfire solutions.","This commentary is by Jennifer Mamola, of Washington, D.C. She works with the John Muir Project, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting national forests from fire-phobic policies, advocating community-out approaches to wildfire resilience, untangling woody biomass from the clean energy narrative and defending nature’s ability to manage biodiversity.


James Campbell’s recent commentary, “How the ‘Fix Our Forests Act’ protects Vermont’s future,” suggests logging is the solution to wildfire, framing forests as overstocked and dangerous. Vermont’s forests historically had dense canopy cover, and fire naturally recycles nutrients, creates habitats and promotes regeneration. These forests are resilient and do not need logging to be “safer.”
The “Fix Our Forests Act” would not protect communities or forests. Thinning and logging leave flammable debris, open the canopy and fragment landscapes, increasing fire spread. Focusing on forests where fire occurs naturally diverts attention from human-built areas, where wildfire truly threatens lives and property. 
Even U.S. Forest Service scientists note that thinning and post-fire logging can increase tree mortality, push flames faster toward homes and release more carbon than the fires themselves would.
Wildfire danger is primarily tied to the human-built environment. The Federal Emergency Management Agency and wildfire experts point to home hardening, defensible space and community preparedness as the most effective ways to protect lives and property. 
Vermont’s recent fires — 82 in 2024 and 45 in 2025, nearly all human-caused — show the real threat comes from human activity and proximity to homes, not forest density. Policies should focus on strengthening communities rather than industrial logging of resilient forests.
H.R. 582, the “Community Protection and Wildfire Resilience Act” introduced by Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., offers a more effective approach. It helps communities develop resilience plans emphasizing home hardening, defensible space and preparedness.
Vermonters deserve solutions grounded in science, not legislation that industrializes forests. The “Fix Our Forests Act” diverts resources, weakens protections and undermines ecosystem resilience. Protecting Vermonters means strengthening communities and homes while letting forests function naturally, supporting both ecosystem and climate resilience.

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)The former head of Washington’s beleaguered juvenile detention system alleges she was fired in retaliation for repeatedly warning of the dangers of overcrowding in the state’s youth prisons.
As assistant secretary of juvenile rehabilitation at Washington’s Department of Children, Youth and Families, Felice Upton oversaw the state’s two youth detention centers: Green Hill School in Chehalis and Echo Glen Children’s Center in Snoqualmie.
After five years at the agency, Upton was fired in April without explanation. Last week, she filed a claim for $4.75 million in damages alleging she was terminated for being a whistleblower about deteriorating conditions in the facilities. The claim serves as a precursor to a lawsuit . 
“DCYF has neglected long-term solutions in favor of short-term actions that are only costing taxpayers more money without addressing the underlying issue,” Upton said in a statement Tuesday.
Tana Senn, the secretary of the Department of Children, Youth and Families, said late Wednesday that Upton’s concerns “were in no part a factor in the personnel and organizational changes I made in executive leadership when I joined as the new head of DCYF.”
In Upton’s tenure, state law changed to send young adults convicted of crimes to youth detention instead of adult prison until age 25. This caused the population in the state’s facilities to balloon.

Last year, the crowding crisis reached the point that the Department of Children, Youth and Families transferred 43 men to an adult prison and temporarily stopped taking in new people at Green Hill.
Since Upton’s ouster, the state has opened Harbor Heights, a smaller detention facility on the grounds of a state prison in Aberdeen meant to relieve some of the burden at Green Hill. But lawmakers did little this past legislative session to provide systemic reform to address the situation.
Last week, a Washington appeals court ruled conditions at Green Hill, the state’s largest youth prison, violated state law amid reports of detainees being forced to urinate in jugs and go weeks without mental health counseling.
Contributing to the dilemma, according to Upton, was the 2022 closure of a third state detention center, the Naselle Youth Camp in Pacific County. In her claim, Upton said she learned of the plan to shut down Naselle on her first day on the job in 2021.
She said that she immediately expressed concern that Green Hill and Echo Glen couldn’t provide the capacity to make up for Naselle’s closure. Over the next few months, Upton asserts, she tried to show Ross Hunter, then the secretary of the Department of Children, Youth and Families, and Allison Krutsinger, the department’s public affairs director, how harmful the shuttering could be.
Upton said she proposed ways to address her concerns about looming overpopulation but her warnings went “unheeded.”
As early as September 2023, Upton, who had previously been the superintendent at Echo Glen, told agency leaders her fears were becoming reality. 
“The lack of capacity was causing unconstitutional treatment of youth and unsafe conditions for staff,” she writes in her claim.
Upton accuses Hunter, who faced calls for his resignation over his handling of the crowding issue, of lying about the deteriorating conditions being unforeseen given her warnings. And she says Hunter suggested she take the fall for criticism the agency was getting.
Hunter now faces a new class-action lawsuit claiming his decision to transfer the young men from Green Hill to adult prison violated their constitutional rights. He didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Upton’s allegations.
Last October, Upton alerted lawyers at the state attorney general’s office about what she says were Hunter’s “false statements,” but they didn’t respond, according to the tort claim. She also complained to the governor’s office of toxic work conditions and inequitable treatment of women and employees of color, leading to an investigation. 
Senn, who replaced Hunter in January, also treated Upton with hostility, according to the claim. Upton said she shared doubts about the plan to open the Harbor Heights detention facility, believing it would violate state law and be especially expensive.
When Senn fired Upton, the agency gave no reasoning for her ouster.

“I was retaliated against and wrongfully terminated for engaging in protected activities, including the reporting (actual and perceived) of improper governmental action,” Upton writes.
Before turning to juvenile detention, Upton worked in the state’s Department of Corrections, which oversees the adult prison system. She now works at the Center for Improving Youth Justice.

Speaking to the House Special Interim Committee on Property Tax Reform, McBride said there are 115 properties in St. Charles County worth more than $1 million covered by a senior citizens tax freeze law. Many were built recently, including a $4 million home built this decade, she said.
And during June, she noted, a bill with caps on growth in tax bills for residential taxpayers in 97 counties exacerbated the problem. She likened it to the television and movie series “Jackass,” where dangerous stunts and potential injuries were the main attraction.
“It’s Jackass legislation, pardon my French, done on the dare, done to look good, to sound good, to capture votes, to put on a show, just like some kid on a trail bike lining up the barrels and trying to jump over them,” McBride said. “It ain’t going to work out. We’re going to hit the fence.”
Lawmakers need to reject anything that doesn’t deal with underlying issues in the tax system, she said.
“We need you to be the adults in the room at the Missouri General Assembly,” McBride said. 
McBride’s testimony opened the hearing, which was the last of six held across the state over the past three months. The committee was formed because aggravation over higher property tax bills has held the attention of state lawmakers for the past three years.
A last-minute change in the committee lineup caught both the chairman, Republican state Rep. Tim Taylor of Boonville, and the ranking Democrat, state Rep. Kathy Steinhoff of Columbia, unaware.
State Rep. Kemp Strickler, a Democrat from Lee’s Summit, was replaced by state Rep. Tiffany Price, a Kansas City Democrat, without explanation.
Under questioning from Steinhoff, Taylor said he had not received notice prior to the meeting that House Speaker Jonathan Patterson had made the change. 
“Rep. Strickler was a very valuable member of this committee,” Steinhoff said. “He was in the eye of the storm in Jackson County.”
Strickler, who drove to the Missouri Capitol Wednesday morning for the hearing, said he was not told why he was removed and only found out shortly before the committee was set to meet.
During the almost six-hour meeting, the committee was urged to change how taxes are levied and how values are determined. Members also heard complaints from the public, including allegations that vengeful assessors will punish property owners who challenge their appraisals. Representatives of agencies dependent on property tax asked that nothing be done that would reduce their revenue.
And, to close it out, committee members questioned Missouri State Tax Commission members and staff over policies and processes that have pushed assessors to increase residential assessments to reflect the rapid runup in home values.
State Rep. Tim Taylor of Boonville, chairman of the Missouri House Special Interim Committee on Property Tax Reform, listens Wednesday during testimony at a public hearing (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Taylor told members their work is not over as the hearing ended.
“This is by far not the last meeting,” Taylor said.
One idea the committee was again urged to adopt would require separate rates for the four classes of property — residential, commercial, agricultural and personal — that could be adjusted when assessed values rise faster than inflation.
Under the Hancock Amendment in the state constitution, when the value of property in a taxing district grows faster than inflation, rates are supposed to be reduced. But when one class of property is increasing faster than others, the effect is a smaller rollback than if the class of property had its own rate.
Another idea that came up again was requiring buyers to file information about the price paid for property — known as a certificate of value — to help assessors when comparing property values.
Some of the most dramatic testimony came from individual property owners trying to understand their assessments.
Jennifer Phanton of Grandview said the assessment on her home doubled in 2023. She found that the comparable sales used weren’t actually comparable, she said, and the assessment form listed improvements that had not been made.
She won her appeal, Phantom said, but it was a lengthy process.
“It’s just a lot because the onus is on us, it is not on the county, to prove the valuation,” Phanton said.
The increase was doubly hard to take, Phanton said, because her income was just above the threshold for the Circuit Breaker tax credit, available to people with a disability or who are 65 and older. 
The circuit breaker tax credit was established in 1973. People over age 65 and those who have a qualifying disability and rent their homes can claim a tax credit to offset property taxes of up to $1,055 if their income is less than $38,200. The credit for homeowners is up to $1,550 if they own their home if their income is less than $41,000.
If the credit is more than the taxpayer owes, the state will write a check for the difference.
Increasing the income limits and credit amounts is the best way to help vulnerable people keep their homes, McBride said.
Missouri law requires county assessors to estimate the value of every property every two years. The tax commission is responsible for making sure the values are within 90 to 100% of market value.
The commission sought to get counties to sign a “memorandum of understanding” when tax assessments fall behind that standard. Some counties are suing over requirements that residential assessments increase by up to 15%. That is the most home values can be increased without an inspection of the exterior.
Under questioning from the committee, Tax Commission member Greg Razer said the commission has acted to control the excessive increases in Jackson County.
Values below market hurt public services, he said. 
“We have to protect the entities that are receiving the tax dollars that the voters have approved, and so if you’re at 60%, eventually you’re not keeping up with inflation, and you can’t provide the same services,” Razer said.
Most of the counties asked to sign a memorandum of understanding have seen a rapid increase in home values in the past five years, said Steve Hobbs, executive director of the Missouri Association of Counties.
Part of it is people moving from high-cost coastal areas and part of it is investors looking for rental properties. 
But Hobbs, like McBride, warned against artificial controls on tax bills. 
“When you create a carve out for one entity,” he said, “you shift the tax burden to others.”
At the end of the hearing, Taylor asked members to make a list of the five issues they would like to see addressed in the committee’s report. The next meeting will be while the General Assembly is holding its special session on redistricting, he said, with a future meeting to finalize a report and prepare legislation.

(Getty Images)Child care providers around Indiana will see reimbursement rate cuts of 10-35% as the state’s Family and Social Services Administration tries to close a $225 million funding gap.
The sustainability maneuver could push providers to drop out of a low-income child care program, however.
“We made this decision to protect the children and families that depend on (Child Care Development Fund) vouchers. There is only one pot of money — we could either protect providers or kids, and we chose kids,” said Adam Alson, the director of the Office of Early Childhood and Out-of-School Learning.
CCDF is a federal program that provides financial assistance via subsidies or vouchers to low-income families to help them pay for child care so parents can work or attend education and training programs.
The rate cuts weren’t an easy decision, Alson said, but the only other way to rein in spending would’ve been to cut the number of families in the program.
Right now, 55,000 children receive a voucher — above the pre-pandemic average of 35,000 participants.
Alson said former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration used federal COVID-19 dollars to raise rates and expand eligibility. The program peaked at 68,000 children, costing almost $900 million in state and federal funding.
When the pandemic assistance waned, the state tapped surplus money from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program in fiscal year 2025 to cover the loss. But those funds are no longer available for CCDF, which means the state would have to pull from its General Fund to make up the difference.

The legislature set aside $147 million in additional dollars for the ongoing fiscal year — which started July 1 — to preserve income eligibility criteria for families already on the program. Lawmakers tightened the requirements for new enrollees.
The program is expected to cost about $400 million in fiscal year 2027.
To establish “equitable” reimbursement rates, the state received surveys from 25% of licensed child care providers and analyzed their cost data, arriving at reimbursement levels that “reflect current operating realities,” a news release said.
Rates for infant and toddler care, for instance, will drop by 10%. Rates for preschoolers between the ages of 3-5 will be cut 15%. And rates for school-age children will be cut by 35%.
The new rates go into effect Oct. 5, with the first pay date being Nov. 6.
Alson acknowledged some providers might drop out of the program.
“There’s definitely a possibility of that occurring. That’s part of the regrettable part of this decision, right? That it does affect business models of child care businesses throughout the state of Indiana. There’s no getting around that,” he said.
The change aligns reimbursements with federal regulations that require the rates to be sustainable, according to the news release. The federal government hasn’t notified the state of any compliance violations.
The cuts are the latest challenge for the program, which added a waiting list for applicants seeking services last December.
Sen. Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, has likened the waiting list to “a moral failure and fiscal disaster,” criticizing the Republican majority’s decision to expand private school vouchers to high-income Hoosiers during the last legislative session rather than boosting early childhood education for low-income residents.

We can hit someone else and hurt them. And it can bounce back at us, hurting us in the process. This lesson is often painful to learn.
Unfortunately, it doesn’t appear that the Michigan House of Representatives learned this lesson based on the recent budget it passed.
It would be easy to pan this House budget proposal as unserious. After all, a number of the cuts are in federal funds that are generally restricted in use to a single program or a few purposes. Cutting programs using these federal dollars doesn’t accomplish much for the state — they don’t always realize savings on the state funding side of the budget nor can we redirect the federal funds to other priorities. 
Instead, they simply sit in the state’s bank account or, worse, get returned to the federal government to be redistributed to other states. This results in nothing outside of harming Michiganders who rely on those state services. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, the House Republican budget proposal is serious — it is seriously flawed and will result in serious harm. The cuts made under the guise of rooting out “waste, fraud and abuse” will — just like the harmful federal megabill passed earlier this year — affect the lives and livelihoods of millions of Michiganders. 
The stone thrown by this budget will break systems like health care, harm communities and the economy, dismantle support for K-12 schools and some of Michigan’s universities and hurt the Michiganders that lawmakers claim to represent. 
The House budget proposal doubles down on the tactics taken by policymakers in Washington in the federal megabill. The budget assumes the possibility of deep cuts in Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and provides no meaningful way to fill those gaps. More Michiganders will become sicker, families will go hungry, and our grocery stores, health providers and hospitals will all struggle. And in a state where some communities already lack a grocery store or an easily accessible hospital, these cuts will just make it worse. 
Ultimately, this will affect all 10 million Michiganders, who will have to drive farther to find healthy fruits and vegetables or a doctor who provides specialized care, will have to wait longer to be seen by primary care physicians for routine care, and will have to pay more for daily needs.
What’s worse is that the passed budget goes far beyond the federal cuts. It reduces funding for Double Up Food Bucks, which incentivizes SNAP beneficiaries to purchase fruits and vegetables by matching those dollar for dollar up to $20. This not only helps families remain healthier but also helps support local farmers who sell at farmers markets. It eliminates specific funding for universal school breakfast and lunch, which has been a huge success in ensuring kids have the healthy meals they need to learn and saving families money, instead rolling all of these dollars into a per-pupil payment. 
The budget proposal cuts funding and staff for various food safety programs, so it not only makes it harder to afford groceries and feed our families but it also makes it harder to trust the food we are eating is safe and won’t make us sick.
Michigan’s best ranking in the national KIDS COUNT Data Book this year was health, our only ranking where we fall in the top half of states at 22, and our budget can help support the health of kids and their families, beyond basic health care coverage. But the House budget reduces or completely eliminates support for important maternal and child health services, worsening birth outcomes and long-term health outcomes for kids. It also reduces or eliminates funding for environmental health programs, like safe drinking water, which are vital not only for the health of our community but also for educational outcomes. 
Michigan ranks 33rd for child well-being in annual report with education among the nation’s worst

When combined with the huge threats from the Medicaid cuts, this budget takes a huge step backward in basic health protections.
Policymakers in Washington threw a massive stone when they passed the harmful federal megabill earlier this year. At a time when grocery prices are already high and our health care system is already stretched, their decisions will only make things worse. And clearly some of our state lawmakers didn’t learn from Washington, passing a budget that further disrupts services we all rely on. This will ultimately have significant and long-lasting effects on our communities, our economy, our businesses and all 10 million of our residents. 
And it will be a painful lesson to learn.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_2739-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-09-04 07:56:30.449768

Some farmers keep growing in flood- and drought-prone fields because subsidies soften the losses, while federal programs meant to help them change course have been underfunded and mired in bureaucracy. Under Trump, those programs may weaken further.

The seed tractor sank again, no surprise to Steve Williams. Everything sank out here on Dogtooth Bend in Southern Illinois since the floodwaters ran through five years earlier and dumped millions of tons of sand. The ground looked firm, but deep pockets of sticky mud lurked under the sun-cracked surface, pulling him under without warning.
He hit the gas. His wheels spun in place; sand flew. A few cuss words, too.
He called his daughter, Brandy Renshaw, working a nearby stretch of field in a giant green rig. She turned his way to pull him out; then she sank, too. Williams, in a faded plaid shirt, gray hair sprouting from under a John Deere hat, paced. Renshaw slammed the gearshift, rocked back and forth, and eventually clawed her way out.
It was June 2024, and both father and daughter knew the land they were trying to farm wasn’t going to yield much, even if they got the seeds in the ground. But this had become their routine: farming futile land just to keep from going under. For years now, they’d had one foot stuck in the mud, the other in government bureaucracy. They’d get angry — then laugh.
“What else could you do?” said Williams, 70. “We were left holding the bag.”
In these Mississippi River bottoms, federal farm policy became a trap. Farming is one of the most heavily subsidized industries in America. Each year, Congress allocates billions to keep crops in the ground, cushioning the blow from droughts, floods, fires and market swings — a safety net that dates to the 1930s, when the Depression and Dust Bowl put the nation’s food supply at risk.
But today, in some of the most flood- and drought-prone parts of the country, those programs can also keep people hanging on, even when it makes more sense to walk away. That’s increasingly clear along parts of the Mississippi River Valley and especially here in Alexander County, at the rural tip of Illinois. As the climate changes and as aging levees fail, the risk is becoming more predictable, the losses so frequent it is clear some land will no longer yield what it used to.
But the federal programs that support those changes — enacted first by President George H.W. Bush, then expanded by President Bill Clinton — have been small, slow and ineffective. After the 2019 flood — when the Mississippi River submerged the southernmost corner of Illinois for months, part of a widespread disaster across the Midwest — Congress allocated only about $217 million spread across 11 states to pay farmers to voluntarily retire their flood-ravaged fields.
Federal workers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which ran the program, specifically urged farmers at Dogtooth Bend to sign up. The floods had come here repeatedly and had worsened since they busted through the 17-mile levee that protected Williams’ farmland three years earlier. So Williams signed up, along with about 30 others on Dogtooth Bend, finally ready to call mercy to the river. He offered up roughly 1,200 acres; the federal government offered to pay him about $3,200 an acre to put permanent easements on his land, which he could use for recreational purposes but never farm again.

At the time Williams applied, the program had been offered only one other time in the past decade to farmers along the Upper Mississippi River, despite billions in lost crops. And this time around, the pot — just 1% of the $19 billion disaster aid package — wasn’t big enough to help everyone who applied, especially along this corn- and soy-growing region. And even for those who were accepted, the agency in charge couldn’t keep up with the paperwork, making the process stretch on for years.
The process dragged through the rest of President Donald Trump’s first term and through most of President Joe Biden’s. And now these programs look even less certain as Trump and Republicans in Congress double down on the status quo: expanding crop insurance and farm income supports through the budget bill signed into law on July 4 while — in an effort to trim the federal workforce — gutting the staff responsible for responding to climate disasters, including those who manage permanent easements that pull troubled farmland out of production.
While farmers have struggled to access funds to help them get off flood-prone land, federal programs to keep their crops in the ground have long been the safer bet. Over the past three decades, Illinois has received $35 billion in farm support — more than any state but Texas and Iowa — mostly through insurance subsidies and price supports for growing corn and soybeans. Some of that bounty is grown on flood-prone ground along the Mississippi and other river bottoms.
“At some point in time, don’t you ask yourself: Is this really economically the best way to spend our taxpayer dollars,” said Dave Hiatt, an easement coordinator and biologist with the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, “or would it serve us better in the long run if we spent money to take that ground out of production?”
Hiatt is among the USDA employees on paid leave through September as part of the Trump administration’s plan to reduce the federal workforce.
ProPublica and Capitol News Illinois reached out to the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service on Aug. 15 with a detailed list of questions about how it handled the Dogtooth Bend easements across multiple administrations as well as its priorities going forward. The agency said it was working on a response but did not provide it in time for publication or specify a day when it would respond.
While Williams waited for the buyout to go through, his bills didn’t stop. He still owed a mortgage to the bank, taxes to the county. That left him and Renshaw with a choice: Either do nothing and watch their farm operation go under, or do what they’d always done. Even when it didn’t make sense anymore, they had planted their fields to maintain their federally backed crop insurance. Keeping that crop insurance allowed them to access other agriculture subsidies and disaster aid.
So they mounted their tractors and rolled out to their nearly barren fields.
“You can’t afford to leave it,” Renshaw said. “So we planted what we could and insured everything we could. It was a nightmare.”

It hadn’t always been like this. For decades, this Delta-like sliver of bottomland jutting into the Mississippi River at Illinois’ southern edge was “the garden spot of the county,” as Williams put it. He grew up farming alongside his dad and bought his first property on the peninsula in 1987.
At that point, the land on the flood-prone bend was still protected by the Len Small Levee, built in 1943 and named for an Illinois governor. The water broke through the first time in 1993, then again in 2011. But everyone recognized its days were numbered, and the state and federal government started paying people for their homes and businesses so they could move from harm’s way. That mitigated the risk, but it also meant that after floodwaters cut a nearly mile-wide hole in 2016, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers declined to cover the $16 million repair cost: With fewer people living there, the cost-benefit formula showed it wasn’t worth saving anymore.
Williams and the other farmers were devastated: When the levee was in place, Dogtooth Bend stayed relatively dry even when the Mississippi climbed well past flood stage — 33 feet at the nearby Thebes gauge. Since the breach, water spills into the peninsula every time the river nears that mark, and that happens often now, sometimes for weeks at a time.
As hopes of a levee repair fizzled, farmers were stranded. The federal easement program receives only sporadic funding, and typically only after a presidential disaster declaration, which Illinois didn’t get in 2016, despite widespread damage in Alexander County.
Predictably, Dogtooth Bend flooded again in 2017 and 2018.
Both years, from his office three hours away near Champaign, Hiatt and a small team of federal officials with the Natural Resources Conservation Service scrambled to come up with easement funds, even outside of a disaster declaration.
“We begged, we pleaded with headquarters,” Hiatt said. “We said, ‘We need these funds right now. These people have been this poorly impacted.’”

Federal records show that after floods in both years, Hiatt and his colleagues in Illinois proposed buying out up to 11,500 acres owned by 40 or so landowners on Dogtooth Bend over time, starting with the most severely damaged. The first phase would cost $20 million and was projected to prevent $60 million in near-term damages. The proposal laid out a strong case: Roads were threatened; habitat was disappearing; land was becoming more and more degraded. Thousands of acres had already become unfarmable — and while the reports also weighed the option of restoring the land, they noted that the farmland would never be fully productive, and the costs to keep bailing out farmers would only grow.
By this point, Trump had taken office for the first time, bringing in new USDA leadership. In both 2017 and 2018, Hiatt said, agency leadership in Washington rejected the requests by him and his colleagues in Illinois to help move farmers off the land. This wasn’t unusual: According to one nonprofit’s report, over 25 years, 90% of landowners in the Upper Mississippi states who applied for funding were turned down.
Environmental groups support paying farmers to leave flood-prone land because floodwater that spreads across farm fields washes fertilizer, pesticides and other chemicals into rivers, causing a range of down-river harms. But there’s an economic argument, too: A 2019 study in the science journal Nature Sustainability found that every $1 spent restoring floodplains by clearing them of development and farms can save at least $5 in future damages.
Despite this, the single largest agriculture program in the farm bill is intended to keep people on the land. That comes in the form of crop insurance premiums, an average of 60% of which are paid by the federal government.
In Alexander County, that is closer to 70%. More broadly, the costs of keeping people on their land there were spiraling upward: In addition to subsidies, there were millions more to clean up flood debris, shore up the levees, and fix roads and drainage systems. And still the floods kept coming.
Yet farmers were still planting. “They do the math,” said Silvia Secchi, a farm policy expert at the University of Iowa, about why farmers might keep investing in troubled land. “You and I would do the same math. If you want to stay in business, you do what makes you stay in business.”
For the father-daughter team of Williams and Renshaw, it was barely enough. “All the insurance did was keep people from going broke,” Williams said.
“You aren’t winning,” Renshaw added, “by any means.”
By the time the historic flood hit in 2019, the need to rescue the farmers at Dogtooth Bend was undeniable.

When the river finally pulled back, Williams no longer recognized the land he’d spent his life working. The levee breach had let the full force of the Mississippi pour through Dogtooth Bend for five months. It carved new channels, dumped dunes of sand and even sucked six barges off the main river and left two stranded in a field. People compared the scene to Mars. To the windswept dunes of “Lawrence of Arabia.” To Williams, it was “just a sickening feeling.”
Farmers in Alexander County claimed more than $7 million in crop insurance payouts that year — the highest on record. Roads were so mangled they had to be fully rebuilt. Trash and driftwood littered the peninsula. The damage made the case for a buyout harder to ignore.
If that case weren’t strong enough, the flood also put on display the benefits of letting the levee go. Although the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ decision not to fix it had hurt the nearby farmers, allowing the water to spread out in Dogtooth Bend may have helped relieve pressure on the levee system across the river in Missouri and downriver.
Williams and Renshaw had come to terms with what that meant. Their land had been sacrificed so others’ could be spared. When Williams signed up for the floodplain easement program in August 2019, he figured he’d never farm Dogtooth Bend again. By that point, only about 200 of their 1,200 acres could still grow a crop. “But do it right,” Renshaw said. Instead, they fell into a broken system that left them farming nearly useless land while they waited five years for the federal government to complete their easement paperwork.

Williams knew the government moved slowly, but his first year’s wait seemed absurd. By year two, he’d nearly given up. By the summer of 2024, he was just plain disgusted. He checked in regularly with federal workers, calling the local officials he knew by name on their cellphones or popping into the local office in nearby Tamms. But the federal workers on the ground couldn’t tell him much other than his paperwork was still in process, under review with a federal official somewhere in another state thousands of miles from Dogtooth Bend. They were frustrated, too.
Danette Cross, who worked for the Natural Resources Conservation Service office in Alexander County until her retirement late last year, said most of the farmers knew her by name and often called her directly, expecting she’d have answers. But to get anything resolved, Cross had to run questions up a chain through a half-dozen people. “I’m not going to say the whole thing was a disaster — they closed on a lot of easements,” she said, “but nothing was timely.”
Hiatt, who had failed twice before to bring in funds for these farmers, tried again in 2019, this time banking their hopes on the emergency aid Congress had earmarked for the program. Hiatt said the Illinois team requested $24 million to buy out everyone who signed up at Dogtooth Bend. The payments are not full market value but allow farmers to invest in drier fields that would be less costly to the federal government in the long run.
But headquarters authorized just under $6 million, which it applied to the very worst fields. Williams’ land was hit hard, but it didn’t make the cut. That meant crop insurance and the other safety net farm bill programs would have to sustain him while he waited.
This wasn’t the only holdup. In 2018, Hiatt said, the agency had created a national team to handle land deals in an effort to improve efficiency. But he said it backfired.
“We were acquiring easements in 500 days” when the Illinois office handled the process on its own, he said. “Now we’ve got this specialized team — they’re taking 800. The math is not working there.”
The head of USDA’s Risk Management Agency, which oversees the crop insurance program, made a personal visit to the wreckage after the floodwaters receded in 2019. Martin Barbre, who led the agency for most of Trump’s first term, knew the area well. He grew up visiting his relatives nearby and himself farms just 100 miles away. In a recent interview, Barbre said he empathized with the farmers and wanted to ensure they got everything they were legally owed through crop insurance.
“I mean, you’ve farmed that ground your whole life. Your family’s owned it for, you know, probably for generations, and here it’s just gone,” Barbre said. He didn’t fault the farmers who kept planting while they waited for a federal buyout. “As long as they’re insured, they have the legal right to do that,” he said. “When I was administrator, I had a saying: ‘I want a producer to get every dime he’s got coming from the program — but not a penny more.’”
In 2020, the USDA leadership released additional funding to purchase easements on Dogtooth Bend. Williams bounced between the two programs. Each required new paperwork — and more time.
In 2021, at a meeting in Olive Branch, Hiatt faced frustrated farmers. “I took a beating,” he said. “And I was glad to take it, because it was poorly administered.”
Three more years passed, and no check had arrived for Williams. But the bills still did.
Although it could barely grow a thing, the county still taxed Williams’ land on Dogtooth Bend like it was prime ground — nearly $40,000 a year, according to Williams, calculated in part on farm productivity from across the state. That number would rise in each subsequent year, including on fields buried under 20 feet of sand. That’s because the rate wouldn’t change until the buyout went through and it was officially classified as conservation land.

As one of the poorest and fastest-shrinking places in America, Alexander County — population 4,600 — leans on farmers like Williams to fund basic government services and keep teachers employed in a school district with just over 300 kids. Farming in Alexander County accounts for $1 in every $7 in the local economy. And as more people move out of the county, there are fewer left to shoulder the tax burden.
Sean Pecord, who farmed on Dogtooth Bend not far from Williams, was one of the first to sign up for the buyout program in 2019; his land was the worst hit. “There was nothing left of it to farm,” he said.
“They work at their own pace,” said Pecord, who along with his wife also runs the nearby Horseshoe Bar and Grill. “If they were operating on normal business terms, they’d be bankrupt in a year.”
Pecord received his payment in late 2023, about four years after he signed up. Williams was finally paid last September. “It’s not what they did,” Williams said of the federal government. “It’s how long they took to do it.”
G. Pang, who lives in nearby Missouri and owns land on Dogtooth Bend with her six siblings, said they’re still waiting to get paid — and for answers. She used to call Hiatt’s personal cellphone when she wanted a status update. But today, the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service has been hollowed out, with some 2,400 conservation staffers at home on paid leave through September under the terms of the federal buyout, according to a May report by Politico. Hiatt and his two federal colleagues who oversaw easement purchases in Illinois are among them, as are nearly half the staff of 30 who had been tasked with handling back-end easement paperwork as part of the agency’s national land team.
“Just going in there, taking a chainsaw, removing people and not knowing who you’re going to replace them with, you’re just creating a mess,” Pang said of staff cuts under Trump that have left her family in the dark.
Without the experienced staff, closing on these deals will take even longer, if it happens at all, Hiatt said.
“What’s happening now will never be reversed,” Hiatt said. “Once this is broken, which I don’t know if the break is complete yet, but it’s pretty fractured, I don’t think you can reset that bone.”
Several who joined the buyout were in their 70s and 80s. “They were devastated,” Renshaw recalled.
Williams’ health has deteriorated in the last few years. Macular degeneration has claimed much of his eyesight. Although he’s nearing retirement, he didn’t expect to go out like this.

One of the advertised benefits of the buyout program was that he could take the money and use it to buy farmland elsewhere. But by the time he had his check in hand and was ready to close on new land this year in Alexander County, prices had soared. That means the amount of money he agreed to when he signed on can no longer buy what he’d planned to use it for.
Williams is locked in to the 2020 rate, which is 50% lower than the maximum the government is paying today. If Williams had entered the program today, his land would be worth roughly $2 million more than he agreed to take.
“We could take two acres of that money and buy us an acre up here,” he said. “Now,” he said, “it takes at least three acres of that money to buy an acre up here.”
Part of him regrets signing the papers. The other part knows he didn’t have a choice.
“That monster is still down there,” he said of the river. “It will be back.”

A federal judge has blocked House Bill 1193 for the foreseeable future because he believes it may violate the First Amendment rights of students and teachers. The law will remain blocked until he issues a final ruling after a bench trial, something that will take months to complete. 
The law — which prohibits any programming and curriculum related to diversity, equity and inclusion — includes an exemption for registered student organizations. However, it does not exempt money collected from student activity fees from the prohibition.
The Institutions of Higher Learning, the board that governs the state’s public universities, said that student activity fees, despite being paid by students through their tuition, are considered state money. 
According to respective student newspapers, Mississippi State students pay a flat $25 student activity fee, while University of Mississippi students contribute $2 for every credit hour in which they’re enrolled each semester. 
“Universities are following state and federal law, including the First Amendment’s requirement that student activity fees be used in a viewpoint and content neutral manner,” John Sewell, director of communications for IHL, said in an emailed statement to Mississippi Today. 
The First Amendment to the Constitution protects freedom of religion, speech, the press, peaceful assembly and petitioning the government.
University of Mississippi leadership announced the decision to stop distributing funds to campus organizations in an email sent on Aug. 29 from Provost Noel Wilkin, in the name of “predictability,” no matter the outcome of the lawsuit. 
Instead of disbursing “Student Activity Fee” money to campus groups, departments such as the Office of Student Affairs and the Department of Campus Recreation will organize activities using those funds. Previously, there was a uniform process for student groups to apply for the funding. That process has been suspended. 
“The University is committed to providing a robust slate of student activities this school year with the use of the student activity fees that you pay, and those student activity fees will only be used to support and host student programming,” Wilkin wrote. “In our view, the student activity fee is your money that the university holds in trust for you to be used only for programing for students.”
Associated Student Body president Jack Jones expressed his disappointment in a statement shared to social media. He said the decision would have “serious implications” for campus organizations because they rely almost exclusively on the funds. 
“The [Student Activity Fee] was created by students, is managed by students, and is allocated to students — all to support activities for students,” he wrote. “Over the coming weeks, I will be meeting with student leaders from other Mississippi institutions as we work to ensure the SAF process is returned to the hands of students — where it belongs.”
Senior Calvin Wood, who serves in leadership roles for several University of Mississippi organizations, said the decision will devastate campus organizations. 
“It’s kind of the lifeblood of our student activities system,” he said. “A lot of us are pretty upset about this.”
Wood is afraid that without the funding, the University of Mississippi College Democrats will have a hard time putting on programming and getting people to attend events. 
“Last year, we had a catered Black History Month panel,” he said, as vice president of the organization. “A lot more people showed up because there was food. Now, things like that will be limited — food, guest speakers, swag. We’ll have basically no budget this year.”
Mississippi State University students were notified about a similar decision regarding their student organization funding last week. 
The Reflector, the campus newspaper, reported that the university’s Student Association told campus groups on Aug. 27 that it could no longer distribute funds due to the state law. That money will not be touched, student leadership said. 
In the meantime, student leaders are seeking solutions to finance campus organizations, such as contacting local businesses for fundraising nights and helping campus organizations set up budgets and bank accounts.
The Student Association allocated nearly $47,000 among 87 student organizations last semester. 
Attorneys argued in hearings over the summer that the law was already creating a “chilling effect” across the state’s public schools and institutions. In April, the University of Mississippi pulled its support for the annual Oxford Pride Parade, citing prohibitions in the new state law.

Wes Moore (D), with Maryland Housing Secretary Jake Day, answers questions from media Wednesday. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) said Wednesday he would be willing to accept help from the federal government to fight crime in Baltimore, just not through the deployment of National Guard troops as President Donald Trump (R) has repeatedly threatened.
Moore was responding to Tuesday comments by Trump during a rambling news conference in which he called Baltimore and Chicago crime “hellholes” that needed the presence of federal troops, a deployment he insists he has the authority to order, despite governors and a federal court saying otherewise.
Moore and Baltimore City Mayor Brandon Scott (D) have said repeatedly that rates of homicides and gun violence are declining in the city, but admit there is still work to be done.
Moore said Wednesday using the National Guard to fight crime, as Trump wants to do, would be “performative” and “ridiculous.” He said other federal agencies, such as the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, make more sense for crime-fighting.
“If you want to have a serious conversation about things that the federal government could provide that could be helpful, it could be FBI and ATF support … Those are always useful, and we’re still working in partnership with them,” Moore said in response to reporters’ questions at an unrelated event in Columbia.
“But I’m not going to do things just because it makes people feel good or because we think that people walking around in military fatigues and a long gun somehow makes communities safe,” he said. “Having members of the Guard picking up trash and raking mulch is not a useful spread of resources.”
‘Keep our names out of your mouth’: Moore defends Baltimore against Trump at Pimlico event

The trash and raking comment was a reference to the presence of National Guard troops that Trump deployed to Washington, D.C., last month. Guard members, from D.C. and other states, don’t have arrest powers, so some have been assigned to beautification duties, such as raking and trash pickup.
But Trump called the presence of federal troops in Washington a success, pointing to a drop in major crimes in the city since their deployment.
“It serves as a template – and we’re going to do it elsewhere,” Trump said of the troop presence.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, like Moore and Scott, has argued that crime was already falling in the city before the troops showed up. But she acknowledged this week that the federal presence has helped drive down crime rates even more, earning praise from Trump.
Bowser is in a tough spot, however: While governors control their states’ National Guard troops, the D.C. Guard is under the control of the president, who can deploy them for 30 days in an emergency. And as those 30 days draw to a close, it appears the GOP-controlled Congress is prepared to extend the president’s authority to keep troops on the street.
Bowser on Tuesday issued an executive order outlining a “path forward beyond the presidential emergency” for city officials to “ensure coordination with federal law enforcement to the maximum extent allowable by law within the District.”
It specifically named federal law enforcement agencies — the FBI, ATF, U.S. Park Police, Drug Enforcement Administration, Capitol Police and the Secret Service. Left out were references to the National Guard or the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who have also surged into the city, often masked and poorly identified as they make high-profile public arrests.
Bowser’s order said that in order to “maintain community confidence” in law enforcement, any federal authorities going forward should not wear masks, should identify their agencies and themselves as they make arrests or otherwise interact with the public.
When asked Wednesday if he would accept a National Guard presence, if it meant that help from other federal agencies would also be provided, Moore rejected the notion.
“I would hope the president is more serious of a leader than to say, ‘The only way I’ll give you something that’s useful is to give you something ridiculous,’” Moore said.
“The National Guard is not trained for this. The National Guard is trained for things like natural disasters and emergencies and deploying overseas,” he said. “I have too much respect for the members of our National Guard to put them on missions they are not trained for.”

It’s the latest round in weeks of verbal sparring between Moore and Trump that has been been escalating since the president sent National Guard troops to the District.
It was revived Tuesday, when a reporter asked Trump if he planned to deploy the National Guard to Chicago. In his reply, Trump looped in Baltimore, describing both cities as “a hellhole right now” citing gun violence, homicides and other crimes.
Without saying when, Trump said he planned to send troops into Chicago — despite fierce opposition from the governor and mayor there — and insisted that “we have a right to do it, and that includes Baltimore.” But he also said it would be better if Moore and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker asked for the help.
“I would love to have Gov. Moore call, because I watched him over the weekend trying to explain, ‘Baltimore, what we need is housing,’” Trump said. “No, they don’t need housing. They need to get rid of the criminals
“These are hard-core criminals,” he said. “They’re not going to be good in 10 years, in five years, in 20 years, in two years they’re going to be criminals. They were born to be criminals.”
Moore, who had just announced an executive order Wednesday aimed at speeding government approval for new affordable housing developments, said it was “sad” that the president didn’t appreciate how reducing the state’s housing shortage plays into crime reduction.
“What we’re doing is actually working to reduce the stem of violence,” Moore said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_sept3_moore_trump_nationalguard_baltimore_edit2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-04 06:58:04.174429

Brown/Maryland Matters)When it comes to solving Maryland’s significant housing shortage, the Moore administration believes that time is of the essence — and that current state processes aren’t moving fast enough.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) signed an executive order Wednesday that aims to reduce administrative hurdles to new housing projects across the state and hasten the development of new units.
“This executive order can be wrapped up in one word – speed,” Moore said at a signing event at the Legacy at Twin Rivers housing complex in Howard County.
“We need to move faster to build new homes. We need to move faster to make homes more affordable and protect our renters. We need to move faster to create a housing market that is more competitive,” he said.
The executive order aims to fast-track housing development to reduce the approximately 96,000-unit shortage Maryland currently faces. That shortage was driven by “insufficient housing construction over the last 15 years,” said the order, which said the lack of affordable housing options has created an “imminent threat of widespread social and economic disruption.”
Gov. Wes Moore (D) and Housing Secretary Jake Day take questions from reporters. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)
“We believe that housing is a foundation on which we will build everything else,” Moore said. “If you want to create wealth, start with housing. If you want to create jobs, start with housing. If you want to attract new businesses, create housing.”
To counter stagnating housing development, the order instructs state agencies to cut red tape in the approval process for new housing projects, prioritize development near transit, and identify surplus state-owned land for potential sites of new affordable housing development opportunities.
Moore added that environmental impacts and community voices will still be considered but that the state must “not allow process to institute paralysis.”
The order also creates a state housing ombudsman to oversee permit-approval processes and offer recommendations about where those processes could be improved. In addition, the Department of Housing and Community Development will establish housing targets for the state and each jurisdiction every five years, starting in January. The agency will also track the progress of jurisdictions.
Some of the priorities outlined in the executive order already exist in state law, but housing officials say the current framework must work faster to address the state’s housing needs.
“Housing doesn’t just happen. It’s planned, it’s designed, and it’s thoughtful,” Housing Secretary Jake Day said at Wednesday’s event. “We’re taking another critical step toward ensuring everyone in Maryland has access to a safe, affordable place to call home.”
Day gives county planners ‘pre-decisional’ look at 2026 housing priorities

The executive order follows Moore’s previous efforts to boost housing supply in the state – some that were successes and some, not so much.
During the 2024 legislative session, the General Assembly passed Moore’s three-pronged housing package to incentivize higher-density housing, among other initiatives.
But Moore did not fare so well in this past session, when he proposed legislation that tied housing development initiatives to areas with high job growth. It did not get its first hearing until March and quickly faced criticism from local officials. Lawmakers struck the original bill and replaced it with language that granted vesting rights for developers, among other measures. The legislation ultimately died in a Senate committee.
This year, the administration has already started workshopping “predecisional” bill language with county officials to get a conversation going well before the start of the 2026 legislative session.
“The reality is simple folks – without housing, we cannot solve the housing affordability crisis,” Day said Wednesday. “Nearly one in three Maryland families are cost-burdened by rent or mortgage payments. More than half of the renters in this state, 53%, are paying greater than 30% of their income just to keep a roof over their heads, and that is unacceptable.”

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A federal appeals panel has taken the unusual step of asking the New Jersey Supreme Court to weigh in on a constitutional challenge to a state law meant to protect certain public officials by shielding their home addresses and phone numbers from disclosure.
U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Stephanos Bibas said Daniel’s Law — passed in 2020 after a disgruntled lawyer fatally shot a federal judge’s son, Daniel Anderl, at their North Brunswick home — raises “a difficult First Amendment question that depends on an equally difficult question of statutory interpretation.”
“The questions are important and most suitable for the New Jersey Supreme Court,” Bibas wrote in a Tuesday filing. “New Jersey unanimously enacted the original version of this law in the wake of a tragic crime that made national headlines. The state has a strong interest in interpreting its own law — particularly if a federal court is unsure of its constitutionality.”
Bibas asked state Supreme Court justices to decide the narrow issue of “mens rea,” a Latin phrase that translates to “guilty mind” and essentially means wrongful intent. The federal appeals court will retain jurisdiction of the case and reconsider the constitutional challenge after the state justices decide if and how much Daniel’s Law requires a person or company to have acted purposely, knowingly, recklessly, and negligently to be deemed in violation of the law, Bibas wrote.
The Supreme Court can accept or reject the 3d Circuit’s question, and if it accepts the question, will respond “as soon as practicable,” according to the rules of court.
The ongoing court battle started after state legislators in late 2023 amended the law to establish fines for violators of $1,000 per violation plus punitive damages, among other things.
Within months, the Atlas Data Privacy Corporation filed nearly 200 lawsuits claiming violations and seeking damages from data brokers who failed to take down protected people’s personal information within 10 business days, as the law requires. The corporation, which has about 19,000 subscribers, files claims on behalf of police and other people protected under Daniel’s Law and splits the damages with them if they win, according to Bibas’ ruling.
The data brokers responded by seeking to get the lawsuits dismissed and the law struck down as an overly broad, unconstitutional violation of their free speech rights. They argued that Daniel’s Law violates the First Amendment because it regulates speech based on its content and makes violators liable without proving ill intent.
A federal judge denied the dismissal motion in June, the data brokers appealed, and an appellate panel expedited the case and heard arguments in July.
In Tuesday’s order, Bibas noted that content-based restrictions on speech “can survive only if narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest,” Bibas noted.
The data brokers conceded that the law “serves compelling governmental interests,” the judge added. “Yet it raises hard constitutional questions because it restricts their speech and seems to make them liable without fault. To resolve this case, we need to know whether and what mental state(s) the law requires for liability.”
Bibas also noted that Daniel’s Law balances competing policy goals — protecting public officials from physical danger and fear just for doing their jobs while protecting residents’ rights to speak and learn about their public officials. The law has spurred dozens of challenges that risk conflicting court decisions without the state Supreme Court’s final word on the matter, he added.
“To resolve this case, we — and other courts facing similar matters — would benefit from an authoritative construction of the state statute by the New Jersey Supreme Court,” Bibas wrote. “Questions about the law are likely to recur. Certification will give us, litigants, other courts, and the public clear answers.”
A spokesman for the Attorney General’s Office, which is defending the law, declined to comment. The New Jersey State Policemen’s Benevolent Association did not respond to a request for comment.
John Molinelli, a spokesman for the data brokers and a former Bergen County prosecutor, said Bibas’ ruling underscores that Daniel’s Law is well-intentioned but flawed. A federal judge in West Virginia last month struck down a similar law there as unconstitutional, Molinelli added.
A coalition of data brokers fighting the law “believes strongly that New Jersey public servants covered under Daniel’s Law deserve its protections, but a legislative solution is required to restore the law’s original intent and ensure its constitutional survival,” Molinelli said in a statement.
The 3rd Circuit can seek state Supreme Court guidance on questions of law in ongoing court fights if “there is no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision, or statute in this State,” according to court rules. The courts’ website lists nine times that has occurred in the past decade, with appellate judges seeking clarity on everything from the Consumer Fraud Act to furniture delivery regulations.

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Concerns about election integrity, constitutionality and ballot length were among those raised at a public hearing Wednesday in Indianapolis, where voters and election officials weighed in on potential changes to Indiana’s voting system.
The meeting — the second in a series hosted by Secretary of State Diego Morales — was intended to give Hoosiers a chance to comment on proposals to shift municipal elections to even-numbered years and to expand the use of vote centers statewide.
They are required under House Enrolled Act 1633, passed by state legislators earlier this year directing the secretary of state’s office to study the scheduling of local elections and whether the state should require all counties to use vote centers.
Wednesday’s Indianapolis session followed a first hearing in Muncie last month. Three more are scheduled before the end of the year. The next is scheduled on Sept. 19 in Jeffersonville.











Nothing is set in stone. We want to make sure Indiana elections are secure, accessible and transparent.


– Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales



The office will provide the General Assembly with recommendations by Nov. 1, ahead of the next legislative session.
“We’re here to listen,” Morales said in opening remarks. “I want Hoosiers to have confidence that their voices are heard.”
The Republican secretary of state declined to take a stance on the proposals, however.
“I’m going to take all this feedback, compile the information and work with lawmakers. At the end of the day, the General Assembly will make the decision,” Morales told reporters after the meeting. “Nothing is set in stone. We want to make sure Indiana elections are secure, accessible and transparent.”
 Data highlights municipal election turnout

Data presented by staff from the secretary of state’s office showed lighter voter participation in municipal elections than in state and federal races.
The presentations won’t be posted online until after all public meetings have concluded, though.
In 2023, for example, turnout in Indiana’s municipal elections was about 27% statewide, according to data cited in Wednesday’s presentation. That compared with roughly 42% voter participation in the 2022 midterm elections and 61% in the 2020 presidential election.
The presentation additionally highlighted that of Indiana’s 4.7 million registered voters, fewer than 1.3 million cast ballots in the 2023 municipal elections.
In some cities, turnout dipped below 15%, while a handful of smaller towns saw participation above 50%. By contrast, presidential election years regularly draw more than 3 million voters statewide.
Officials also pointed to the spread of vote centers as a cost-saving and efficiency measure. 
Roughly two-thirds of Indiana’s 92 counties have now adopted the model, which allows voters to cast a ballot at any location within their county instead of an assigned precinct. Counties that switched reported average election cost savings of 10% to 15% compared with the precinct system, and wait times for voters on Election Day fell by about one-third, according to Morales’ office.
There are fewer voting locations in a voter center county but a voter can choose where they vote depending on what is convenient to their home, work or other errands. 
 Mixed reactions on vote centers, shifting municipal races

Even so, the vote center model drew mixed reactions. 
Several who attended Wednesday’s meeting pointed to increased convenience for voters who might not be able to get to a precinct polling place.
“Reducing the places you can go is not good for voters, because in Franklin Township … I had to wait in line for three hours,” said Cecilia Poynter, of Indianapolis. “If you work for a company like I did, where they can mandate you to work 12 hours a day, six days a week, you cannot make it to the polls. … For those of us that work long hours — whether it’s early voting or regular on voting day — poll centers are great.”
“But we need more (locations),” she added. “More for early voting, as well as on Election Day.”

Indiana Democratic Party Chair Karen Tallian, who attended the meeting and spoke during the public comment period, also emphasized that reducing the number of voting locations can also disadvantage Hoosiers in small towns if hours aren’t extended.
“Doing vote centers is sort of like closing lanes on the tollway. You’re going to use the same number of people and force them into smaller numbers of areas,” she said. “So, in order to accommodate that, you either have to do early voting for more days, or you need to increase the number of hours.”
Tallian noted, too, that Indiana communities with populations of 35,000 or less can already choose to hold municipal elections in even-numbered years. Ogden Dunes, her hometown in northwest Indiana, has already made the switch to even-numbered years “because it was cheaper for us.”
She urged the state to leave the choice about voting locations to local officials.
“We do not need a statutory change in order to do that. Small towns are already able to do that if they wish,” Tallian continued. “But we do not support in any way forcing larger towns and municipalities to do this during an even-numbered year.”
Questions were additionally raised about whether moving municipal elections into even-numbered years would boost turnout or simply bury local races beneath higher-profile contests.

Jennifer Lewis with the Vigo County Clerk’s Office pointed to possible ballot fatigue.
“One of my concerns is the size of the ballot. The ballot we had last year was already very large. If we added municipal races, it would have been at least two pages,” she said. “The confusion for voters who live outside the city would only get worse if municipal elections were added to the same ballot.”
While the ballot proofing process “is already very strict,” Lewis worried that adding more races “would make it even harder to ensure everything is perfect.”
“I feel like there’s more room for error when ballots get longer and more complicated,” she said.
Some additionally raised constitutional concerns about shifting election dates.
They noted that the Indiana Constitution repeatedly references precincts and sets requirements for how elections are to be conducted — and that local control and traditional precinct voting are constitutionally protected.
“Definitions matter,” said Ann Ihms, an elected precinct official from Howard County. “I’m an engineer, so the fact that it’s not stated constitutionally that this is appropriate, that should have been a no brainer, from the beginning, not to allow non-precinct voting.”
Morales said after the meeting, though, that the issue over constitutionality ultimately rests with lawmakers.
“I’m not an attorney,” he said. “That’s something the legislature and legal experts will have to determine. My job is to facilitate the process, gather feedback and present the information. The General Assembly will decide what is constitutional and what is not.”

(Getty Images)Amid a concerted effort by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to improve the state’s foster care system, some regions are still seeing significant challenges. 
When children enter the state’s child welfare program, it can mean that not only do they need a foster family placement but many of these young children need someone to represent and advocate for them in what can often be complicated and protracted court cases. 
These advocates are usually trained volunteers, and southwest Idaho is in need of more. 
The Court Appointed Special Advocate, or CASA, program is run independently of the state health agency and the courts, and the volunteer and staff CASAs are children’s advocates throughout their entire case. 
“We’re that one adult that’s always going to be there and check in on them every month and help them,” said Elisha Horrocks, executive director of CASA of Southwest Idaho.

The region is currently facing a shortage of CASA volunteers and foster families.
The organization operates as a standalone nonprofit with about 11 staff members and 90 volunteers, Horrocks said. Volunteers receive more than 30 hours of training and must pass background checks before they can serve on a case. 
Judges in child protection cases appoint a CASA, also known as a guardian ad litem, who will meet with the child or children in the case monthly and represent them in court if they’re too young to go themselves. 
CASA of Southwest Idaho — which serves the state’s third judicial district, encompassing Canyon, Owyhee, Gem, Payette, Washington and Adams counties — has supported an average of about 550 children. 


 How to become a CASA volunteer


Be 21 years or older.


Pass a background check with no history of sexual offenses, child abuse or neglect, or domestic violence.


Commit to around 8 to 10 hours per month advocating for foster children.

 Idaho Health and Welfare invested in improving the foster system. Not every region has seen improvements. 

In June 2024, the governor’s former budget chief, Alex Adams, took over as head of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and immediately announced a number of changes related to his laser focus on improving child welfare, the Idaho Press reported.  
As part of this effort, the agency sought and the Legislature approved an additional $23 million to the child welfare budget, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. A major goal was to improve recruitment and retention of foster families, as well as reduce the number of children entering foster care by boosting prevention efforts. 
Statewide, the agency went from a ratio of about 74 foster families for every 100 foster children in June 2024, to having just over a 1:1 ratio of families to kids, as of data provided Monday. State officials’ goal was to have more foster families than kids, so kids aren’t waiting on families. 
North Idaho has a ratio of about 1.45 families for every child, and East Idaho has about 1.6 families per child. However, the Southwest Idaho region has less than one family per child, at a ratio of about .85, as of Monday. 
Horrocks said she thinks there are many reasons for the declines the region is experiencing. The rates of child abuse are increasing, she said, and the severity of these cases takes a toll on volunteers. 
She said the positive messaging from the state health agency may also lead people to believe that the help isn’t needed. 
“A lot of what the department has come out with, is showing that that the foster system is doing good, and it made us feel a little unneeded, which isn’t the case for every district,” Horrocks said. “Some districts are doing very well. Our district is struggling.” 
The lack of available foster families in the area means some of the children are sent elsewhere in the state or sometimes out-of-state, which can complicate the advocate’s job.
“We can’t always get to see the kids in person and have that interaction,” Horrocks said. “We’re still speaking with them, but it’s Zoom, and these kids are young. It’s hard to keep their attention on Zoom.” 
Last year, more than 66% of children served in the program were under the age of 12. 
Despite recent challenges, many of the volunteers end up staying, Horrocks said. In the last fiscal year, the program had a 94% retention rate.  
“I think the volunteers see what the impact is that they have on these children’s lives,” she said. “And as hard as it is, it’s worth it.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Less than a month before the planned closure of two Wisconsin veterans’ housing sites, a handful of Democratic and Republican lawmakers are seeking a way to save the sites. But bipartisan work on a solution appears out of reach as lawmakers bicker over who is to blame for the lack of funding and over whether to take up Democratic- or Republican-authored bills.
Gov. Tony Evers’ administration announced, shortly after the state budget was completed in July, that two Veterans Housing and Recovery Program (VHRP) sites, one in Chippewa Falls and one in Green Bay, would be closing on Sept. 30 due to a lack of funding in the state budget. One facility in Union Grove will remain open. 
The program, which is run under the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs, serves veterans who are on the verge of or are already experiencing homelessness, including those who have been incarcerated, unemployed or have physical and mental health problems. Participants get access to transitional housing, referrals to service providers, financial assistance, assistance with seeking vocational opportunities and access to a room at a reduced rent for working veterans.
Participants can stay for a maximum of 24 months, but the average length is six to 10 months.
The program has been funded with a combination of an appropriation from the Veterans Trust Fund, payments made by program participants and per diem payments, which are made to the agency by the federal government at a current rate of about $71 per resident per day. However, growing staffing and maintenance costs at the facilities led to the need for additional state support. Evers had included a funding proposal in his budget but that was removed by Republican lawmakers.
Following the news of the closures, Sens. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) and Jaime Wall (D-Green Bay) introduced a bill that would dedicate $1.9 million to the sites.
At a press conference outside the state Capitol Wednesday, the bill authors and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) urged Republicans to schedule a hearing for their bill expeditiously.
Citing the upcoming closure date, Hesselbein said the Senate and Assembly must meet. She said committees could meet this week or next to hear the legislation and pass it out of committee this month and have the bill on the floor in October.
“It’s a cool day out here today. The weather is going to get worse. We need to take care of our veterans,” Hesselbein said.
According to the Associated Press, the state Senate is not planning to meet for a floor session this month. 
“It’s way past time to take action to keep these facilities open so they can continue to provide vital services to our veterans,” Hesselbein said, adding that “when Democrats have the power of majority which we believe is coming in just a few years, we will always have your backs.” Democrats are seeking to flip control of the state Senate in the 2026 election cycle. 
Smith called Republicans’ lack of action on the issue “callous,” noting that Democrats tried months ago to include the funding in the budget. When Democrats proposed an amendment to  fund the veterans’ housing sites in the state budget, every Republican voted against it except for Sen. André Jacque (R-New Franken). 
It is unlikely that the Republican-led Legislature will allow Democrats’ bill to advance. 
“[Republicans] have ignored our pleas. As far as we know, we’re not going to see these bills on the floor this month, and this is the final chapter. This is when it ends. No hope for the veterans that they like to pretend that they care about,” Smith said. 
Jacque, meanwhile, began circulating his own bill last month to provide the needed funding for the facilities. 
The Republican bill, coauthored by Jacque and Rep. Benjamin Franklin (R-De Pere), includes $1.9 million for the VHRP program as well as two other policy changes related to veterans. 
One would require the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin system to provide funding to the UW Missing-in-Action Recovery and Identification Project to support missions to recover and identify Wisconsin veterans who are missing. The other would lower the eligibility threshold for veterans and surviving spouses to claim the veterans and surviving spouses property tax credit.
Jacque said the two policies were also left out of the budget and are critical to helping veterans.
“Every budget has missed opportunities, and I am hopeful that the rest of the session will provide openings to address those challenges in a number of areas, particularly providing for our veterans who have done so much in service to our country and communities,” Jacque told the Wisconsin Examiner in an email.
Jacque said he has “found a lot of support” from his Republican colleagues and is “hopeful that the bill will be referred to the Senate Committee on Natural Resources, Veterans and Military Affairs,” which he chairs.
In response to a question about Jacque’s bill and whether Democrats are working with any Republicans to advance funding for the facilities, Hesselbein brushed off the GOP bill saying it simply pulled from Democrats’ ideas. 
“What Sen. Jacque did is he took three Democratic bills and pushed them all into one omnibus. We’ll be interested if he gets a hearing. I’m not sure…,” Hesselbein said. “I like to have clean legislation when we try to have committee hearings so you can hear exactly what’s going on with those bills, so we are supporting the bill that Sen. Wall and Sen. Smith put forth.”
Smith said Democrats separated the VHRP funding from other policies purposefully. Wall added that their bill is a “smaller, cleaner ask” than a bill with multiple items. 
Jacque told the Wisconsin Examiner in an email that he is “extremely disappointed by Sen. Hesselbein’s comments and her unwillingness to put partisanship aside for the sake of working to support veterans — as I did when I voted for the omnibus veterans motion her caucus introduced during the budget. I am rather surprised at her comments due to her longstanding penchant for putting forward omnibus bills and amendments.” 
Jacque noted that he has supported and authored legislation to expand the property tax credit for veterans and surviving spouses in previous years “going all the way back to my service in the State Assembly,” and has also supported previous UW MIA legislation. 
“I supported VHRP within the budget and it was not introduced as standalone legislation by any legislator previously to that, at least to my knowledge,” Jacque added. “I didn’t think Sen. Hesselbein was that unaware of the history of these initiatives.”
Not every Republican lawmaker has appeared open to providing additional funding that would be used to keep the two VHRP programs open. Following the initial news of the planned closures, Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) and Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) co-chairs of the Joint Finance Committee, blamed Evers for not negotiating for the money in the budget.
According to the Green Bay Press Gazette, Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) claimed last week that Evers had a “slush fund” — referring to federal pandemic aid — and should be able to find the money to keep the facilities afloat. He pointed to the Wisconsin DVA’s Veterans Trust Fund, a state fund that supports most grant and benefit programs for Wisconsin veterans, and said the agency has regularly returned around $1 million in unspent funds each year and in 2025, the agency sent back about $600,000.
WDVA Assistant Deputy Secretary Joey Hoey has disputed the comments, saying that the agency is “only allowed to spend the money they tell us to spend.” He has also said the trust fund cannot be used for the staffing costs and that there isn’t enough in it.
Wall objected to Wimberger’s “slush fund” comments as well on Wednesday, saying that federal American Rescue Plan Act money has been spent. ARPA funds were used to help support costs for the program in 2023-24. States had to expend the one-time ARPA funds by the end of 2024.
“[Evers] took some ARPA interest funds and used it to help prop up the program. Those funds don’t exist anymore. The ARPA funds all had to be allocated by the end of last year,” Wall said. “The ARPA interest money was all spent in the last budget, so that get out of jail free card doesn’t exist.”

The Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, planned for northern Maryland, continues to generate court challenges. (File photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)A federal district judge in Maryland ruled Tuesday that power company PSEG does not need protection from U.S. marshals to conduct land surveys for a controversial Piedmont power line project — at least not for now.
Since PSEG filed its petition last month seeking backup from the marshals, most of the landowners who were named as having blocked or threatened surveyors have pledged to cooperate with the survey, wrote U.S. District Judge Adam B. Abelson.
“Given the limited resources of the U.S. Marshals Service, the Court concludes that the circumstances — at least at present — do not warrant sending U.S. Marshals to accompany PSEG and its agents,” Abelson wrote in his order Tuesday.
Abelson did admonish two landowners who have not fully complied, giving them until Sept. 10 to explain to the court why they should not face monetary sanctions or civil contempt of court.
And he handed PSEG a victory Tuesday, granting the company access to survey about 150 more properties with defiant owners. It was a repeat of Abelson’s earlier ruling in the case, during which he approved PSEG’s request to access about 100 properties for wetland, forest delineation and archeological surveys. It was some of that first group of landowners whose antagonism toward surveyors sparked the request for protection from federal marshals.
They are the latest turns in a dizzying legal saga surrounding the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, a 67-mile transmission line proposed to cut through rural parts of Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties. The project was commissioned by regional electric grid operator PJM, which has warned of power shortages in the years ahead unless additional transmission infrastructure is brought online to keep pace with rising demands for power from data centers, among other demands.

A passionate opposition has developed, led by landowners in the power line’s path, who argue that the massive towers will disrupt rural lands, including forests, wetlands, streams and farm fields.
The line still must receive a critical approval from the Maryland Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities. To assess the power line’s route, officials ordered a number of surveys, but many landowners proved uncooperative. That’s when PSEG sued for a court order that would let the surveys move forward.
Abelson sided with PSEG, ruling in June that its surveyors could enter private land to conduct surveys for the line. Opponents of the line appealed that ruling to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has yet to hear the case.
Last month, meanwhile, the New Jersey-based transmission company asked Abelson to dispatch marshals to protect the process, citing six instances when combative landowners — or in some cases, their neighbors or other third parties — threatened its land surveyors.
In one incident, a landowner’s father nearly struck surveyors with an all-terrain vehicle, amid a verbal altercation that included racist insults, the company said.
In his order Tuesday, Abelson said that that landowner, Brandon Hill,  had expressed his “sincerest apologies” for the incident with his father on the ATV, in a letter written by his attorney. But Hill’s attorney never formally responded to the court, despite an order to do so, Abelson wrote.
Another owner pledged to cooperate — before telling the Frederick News-Post in an interview that he would “do everything in my ability to keep them off our property,” adding: “We will do it peacefully.”
Abelson ordered those two landowners to file responses by Sept. 10, explaining why they should not face monetary sanctions or civil contempt of court.
Abelson’s separate order Tuesday, granting PSEG access to survey a second batch of properties, means that the company can survey those properties simply by placing a notice on the front door 24 hours in advance. PSEG is expected to file another lawsuit seeking a court order to access the properties of a third round of property owners who have refused surveys.
In an August status report, PSEG indicated that it had completed about 150 surveys of varying types on the original list of properties, but it still had more than 200 surveys left to go.

The $54 million Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub would be among the largest CO2 banks in the U.S.
The post Crews drilled 3 miles deep in Wyoming, hoping to tap emerging CO2 storage market appeared first on WyoFile .","Crews have successfully drilled more than 18,437 feet to tap Sweetwater County’s Madison Limestone formation. The engineering feat, which took months, is a major step toward establishing what developers hope will be one of the largest carbon dioxide storage projects in the U.S.
At 3.5 miles, It’s the deepest Class VI carbon dioxide injection well in the U.S., according to project officials, and it is the second well completed for the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub project. It is part of the public-private Wyoming CarbonSAFE program, which aims to identify geologic formations to permanently store carbon dioxide from industrial facilities in the region.
The average depth for an oil or natural gas well in Wyoming is about 8,000 feet or 1.5 miles, according to industry sources. Anything more than 12,000 feet is considered “deep,” by industry standards. The deepest petrol well in Wyoming is nearly 26,000 feet, in the Madden formation near the Lost Cabin gas plant in north-central Wyoming, according to the Petroleum Association of Wyoming.
The first well for the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub reached a depth of just over 16,000 feet.

“This deeper well gives us a more complete picture of the subsurface, reinforcing our commitment to building scalable, practical carbon solutions for Wyoming’s key industries,” Frontier President and Co-Chief Executive Officer Robby Rockey said in a prepared statement.
The new well, referred to as J1-15, will provide a wealth of new data to potentially confirm years of previous modeling, which has so far suggested the Madison Limestone is capable of holding large volumes of carbon dioxide. Targeting several geologic strata, the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub could hold more than 350 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, according to Frontier.
For scale, a typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Carbon dioxide capture and storage vision
The University of Wyoming’s School of Energy Resources partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy about 10 years ago on the CarbonSAFE Initiative. The vision is to advance the use of carbon capture technologies — filtering carbon dioxide from smokestacks — by providing a place to put the greenhouse gas.

It’s a major pillar of Gov. Mark Gordon’s Decarbonizing the West energy policy initiative, which he has said will help keep Wyoming’s fossil fuels in the nation’s energy mix while building a new commercial sector to reduce the nation’s industrial carbon dioxide emissions.
In addition to the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub project, exploration and validation efforts are underway at Echo Springs in Carbon County and at the Dry Fork Station coal-fired power plant in Campbell County. Apart from the Wyoming CarbonSAFE efforts, Tallgrass Energy is exploring a carbon sequestration project in Laramie County.
Frontier Infrastructure, a division of Dallas-based Tailwater Capital, is the primary private partner for the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub. The $54 million project is backed by about $43 million in federal money, according to project officials. It’s unclear, so far, exactly which companies and gas-emitting facilities might sign on to offload their carbon dioxide, but Frontier has indicated that local trona mines and soda ash processing facilities in the southwest corner of the state will serve as its “anchor” clientele. 
One potential client, the Project Bison direct-air capture partnership between Carbon Capture Inc. and Frontier Carbon Solutions, is no longer active, according to those familiar with the project. Despite the Trump administration’s efforts to ease emission regulations, many still see carbon capture and carbon storage as a growing industry in the U.S. and abroad.
Frontier Infrastructure, for its part, is dedicated to “empowering industries to meet their carbon reduction goals” and helping to ensure “that the region remains competitive in an evolving global market,” according to its website.
As for the security of existing federal funding for the Sweetwater Carbon Storage Hub efforts, it is currently “obligated” through February, according to an SER official close to the project.

Draft bill would raise funds for trail-building and infrastructure projects as outdoor recreation grows in popularity.
The post Pay to pedal: Lawmakers propose state parks mountain bike user fee appeared first on WyoFile .","More and more, the crowds visiting Wyoming state parks like Curt Gowdy, Glendo or Sinks Canyon do so with mountain bikes in tow. 
Lawmakers and agency officials are looking to capitalize on the bicycle boom with a user fee. A draft proposal would authorize Wyoming’s Division of State Parks to charge bikers for a sticker or permit — with the money going toward projects to build or improve non-motorized trails.
These permits aren’t envisioned to break the bank: $10 seasonal permits for Wyoming adults; $20 for non-resident adults or $5 for a daily fee. The revenue, however, could help address a desperate need, advocates say. 
“We’ve got some real challenges with outdoor recreation, statewide,” said Wyoming State Parks and Cultural Resources Deputy Director Chris Floyd. “I think funding for non-motorized [trails] is at the top of our list.”
The Legislature’s Travel, Recreation, Wildlife & Cultural Resources committee has begun drafting legislation that would create the program. The committee started discussing general user fees earlier this summer as a way to generate revenue to feed a growing appetite for trails. 
The bill would empower the state parks agency to designate state trails that would require a trail permit for cyclists. Rider permits could be checked or sold at entrance gates, with the funds funneled into a new account earmarked for non-motorized trail costs — including construction, signage and parking lots. 
The draft bill’s proposed fees target mountain bikers — both traditional and electric — because they present the largest demand, Floyd told WyoFile. 
“We receive more requests for bike trails than any other recreational infrastructure,” he wrote in an email. “The demand is high and growing, which cannot be said for many other types of recreation.”

A consequence of inadequate bike trail inventory, he continued, is the building of rogue trails, which can degrade the landscape. And, he noted, “bikers have expressed a willingness to pay a small fee, IF the funding goes to trails, which it would under this bill. We have not heard the same support from hikers and equestrians yet.”
Jerimiah Rieman, an avid mountain biker and author of the guidebook “Wyoming Singletrack,” has that willingness.
“I’m favorable to paying a fee if I understand that those fees are going back to mountain bike or trail-specific needs, whether that be construction, maintenance and other features that come with those trails,” Rieman said. If he had any feedback for the proposal, he said, it would be to expand the fee system to a larger network of registered trails outside state park lands. 
Mounting demand 
Outdoor recreation has been growing in popularity in Wyoming for decades, with the COVID-19 pandemic accelerating that trend as it spurred more Americans to spend time outdoors. 
That uptick brought record visitation to national and state parks in Wyoming and generated significant trickle-down revenue to shops, restaurants and hotels in the state.

It has also generated a demand for new outdoor offerings, especially bike-related ones. But those aren’t cheap: Trail construction costs about $100,000 a mile, experts say. 
Wyoming in 2023 created a trust fund specifically to pay for outdoor recreation infrastructure. However, the trust fund will take some time to mature, Floyd said. 
That’s where a user fee could come in. Wyoming has a robust motorized trails system designated for snowmobiles, side-by-sides and other vehicles with motors. Motorized users pay a fuel tax that helps fund projects, while snowmobilers pay a permit fee for a decal, which helps pay for the establishment, maintenance and grooming of trails.
State Parks wants to essentially adapt that model for non-motorized recreation, with a focus on bikes. The bill enables the agency to determine which park trails to charge fees for. It won’t make sense for all parks, Floyd said.
But two of the state’s most popular are also mountain biking destinations. Curt Gowdy located between Laramie and Cheyenne, which is home to 35 miles of trails, tallied roughly 560,000 total visitations in 2023. Glendo State Park, east of Casper and home to more than 45 trail miles, hosted 483,000 that year. 
If Wyoming enrolled its top three parks for bicycles right now, Floyd said, “we would see about $110,000 a year” in fee revenue. The state could expand the program in the future if it sees fit, he said. 
The bill also enables the agency to fund projects in the parks as well as within five miles of their boundaries. That allows it to potentially partner with land managers or other entities on projects, Floyd said.

Michael Kusiek, executive director of Wyoming Pathways, supports the proposal. He called the demand for trails in Wyoming “tremendous” and noted that when outdoor recreation infrastructure grants were opened in 2022, more than $70 million in requests came in for $14 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act dollars. Most of those requests were for trails. 
“So it’s by far and away the number one amenity folks are looking for,” Kusiek said. 
More outdoor rec dollars?
When it comes to the growth of outdoor recreation across Wyoming, Floyd said, his agency continually asks itself: “Where are we going to put all these people, without harming Wyoming’s resources, and how are we going to pay for it?” 
This bill, he said, provides that answer. 
Legislators on the travel committee are considering another mechanism to fund outdoor recreation. During an August meeting, the panel advanced a bill that would funnel some of the proceeds from online gaming into Wyoming’s outdoor recreation trust fund.

The resistance to Federalists’ hysteria about supposed French influence in American politics is history worth revisiting, writes columnist David Adler.
The post Madison and Jefferson looked to states, public opinion to resist federal oppression appeared first on WyoFile .","When confronted with the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts on July 14, 1798, which Thomas Jefferson and James Madison viewed as an untrammeled attack on the fundamental rights of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, as well as the republican system itself, they turned to familiar constitutional guardrails — Americans’ fierce defense of their rights, public opinion and the powers of individual states — to preserve our foundational liberties.

Opinion

The Federalists’ hysteria about supposed French influence in American politics led to prosecution under the terms of the Sedition Act, despite First Amendment guarantees ratified just seven years earlier, for criticism “bringing either Congress or the President [John Adams] into contempt or disrepute.” Federalist prosecutors took dead aim at newspaper editors of the Republican press — sympathetic to Vice President Jefferson — and various public officials, including Rep. Matthew Lyon of Vermont. Lyon and others were sentenced by federal courts to nine months in prison. Vermont voters, however, were not deterred by Lyon’s conviction and reelected him to the House of Representatives while he was in prison.
Jefferson, who characterized the Federalists’ tenure as “the reign of witches,” met with Madison in Virginia to discuss responses and remedies to the repressive measures. Jefferson believed that “with a little patience,” and “the spells dissolved,” that the people would recover “their true sight” and restore “their government to its true principles.” They believed that it was necessary to let the Federalist hysteria run to the point of arousing popular disgust, but that both the people and the Republican press needed a rallying point, perhaps a statement of principles that could focus the public’s sentiment against the administration.
In terms reflective of opposition strategies that resonate across time, Madison and Jefferson agreed that public opinion could be spiked through use of state legislatures, which they believed could be the most effective organs of protest. In their own time, from the run-up to the American Revolution and the Declaration of Independence, the use of assemblies to issue protests and resolutions was a common practice. In retirement, after serving as vice president and president, Jefferson continued to believe in the strength and vitality of states as defenders of rights and liberties. 
In 1811, Jefferson wrote to a European philosopher that “the true barriers of our liberty in this country are our State governments; and the wisest conservative power ever contrived by man, is that of which our Revolution and present government found us possessed. Seventeen distinct States can never be so fascinated by the arts of one man, as to submit voluntarily to his usurpation. Nor can they be constrained to it by any force he can possess.”
While American history does not reveal the wholesome record that matches Jefferson’s idealism about the virtues of states, his point is crucial: States have the potential and power to thwart federal repression of our civil liberties, human rights and a host of actions that offend our constitutional democracy, including executive usurpation of power. Madison and Hamilton shared Jefferson’s recognition of the capacity of states to preserve our Constitution. 
Writing 10 years earlier, Madison declared in 1788 that even in the absence of specific constitutional guarantees of the rights of individuals, these were secured by “the limited powers of the federal government and the jealousy of the subordinate governments.” He said that “state legislatures were sure guarantees of the people’s liberty,” and urged the right of states to “interpose” their opposition to unconstitutional federal measures. Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist Papers 26 and 28, had asserted similar, and even stronger statements. “It may be safely received as an axiom of our political system that the State governments will, in all possible contingencies, afford complete security against the invasions of public liberty by the national authority.” He emphasized that states can “communicate with other states” and “unite for the protection of their common liberty.” This united front suggested possible courses of action in the face of federal menace.
Hamilton wrote, perhaps prophetically: “The State legislatures, who will always be not only vigilant but suspicious and jealous guardians of the rights of the citizens against encroachments from the federal government, will constantly have their attention awake to the conduct of the national government, and will be ready enough, if anything improper appears, to sound the alarm to the people, and not only to be the voice, but if necessary the ARM of discontent.”

Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., and a Democratic colleague from Minnesota.
The Rural Microentrepreneur Assistance Program — created in the 2008 Farm Bill and overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture — provides low-interest loans to eligible development organizations. Those funds fuel revolving loans that provide help to qualified rural microenterprises.
Currently, the program relies on annual appropriations. The Senate proposal pushed by Ricketts and U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., would extend the program for five years so it no longer would require annual approval, a Ricketts spokesman said.

“Our bipartisan bill gives rural innovators more tools to expand their businesses and create jobs,” said Ricketts. “By expanding opportunity, we can help grow Nebraska.”

The measure also would increase the maximum amount a rural microenterprise may borrow, from $50,000 to $75,000. It would raise from 75% to 100% the cap on the federal source share of a project’s cost. 
Center for Rural Affairs continues to fight for small farmers, but scope now much broader

The bill specifies that a project loan can’t cover more than half of demolition, construction or related costs of real estate improvements
Smith said that too often, residents of rural communities can’t access financing they need. “This bipartisan legislation would help them get their businesses off the ground with federal loans and technical assistance,” she said.
Kalee Olson, policy manager at the Center for Rural Affairs in Nebraska, applauded the effort, saying such programs need to evolve “to serve the changing needs of rural entrepreneurs.”
Companion bipartisan legislation was recently introduced in the House. Efforts to include the program in the next Farm Bill continue, the Ricketts team said, but Ricketts wanted a way to ensure continued growth of the program.

Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) at a news conference during the 2025 General Assembly session with Senate Minority Whip Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll). (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Add Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) to the list of Republicans kicking the tires on a run for governor.
Hershey, who has a dozen years in the Maryland Senate, said in a radio interview Wednesday he is being encouraged to consider throwing his hate in the ring, following the entrance of Ed Hale Sr.
“I think Maryland Republicans deserve better than to have lifelong Democrats switch jerseys at the last minute and try to claim our nomination,” Hershey told WBAL Radio, adding that Republicans “know the difference between conviction and convenience.”
“Families are being crushed here by higher taxes and rising energy costs, a governor that’s focused on Washington more than Annapolis,” he said. “So, I think it’s more clear now than ever that Marylanders deserve leadership that’s rooted in authenticity and opportunism, and that’s where I think Ed Hale was going with his campaign.”
Hershey did not respond to attempts to reach him Wednesday.
Hershey has been rumored to be considering entering a Republican field filled with candidates who changed parties, and a cast of others who have little to no electoral experience and even less in a statewide campaign.
Hale, a lifelong Democrat, switched parties and re-announced his campaign last month, after telling reporters he had no shot at defeating incumbent Gov. Wes Moore in a Democratic primary.
Since then, Hershey has criticized Hale. The businessman in return said he didn’t know who Hershey was.

“I’ll tell you this, the number of calls and texts and messages I’ve received from, you know, not just Republicans, but independents and moderates across the state, since Hale’s announcement, saying: ‘Steve, we need a real Republican and somebody that’s stood up for us consistently.’ That type of encouragement is humbling, and I’d be lying if I said it hasn’t made me think seriously about the next step,” Hershey told WBAL.
“So, I’m being thoughtful about this decision. I want to make sure that if I take this step, it’s done the right way. I’ve spent my career standing up for fiscal discipline, reliable energy, accessible health care, safe communities, and if Marylanders believe that’s the kind of leadership they want in the governor’s office, then I owe it to them to take a serious look at it,” he said.
Hershey has electoral experience, but his district is made up of rural counties. It is unclear how quickly he could pull together a statewide campaign and fundraising apparatus.
He would need to decide quickly. Every day he delays is one less day to raise funds. Like all legislators, he is barred from fundraising activities during the General Assembly session.
There is also the unknown — primarily will former Gov. Larry Hogan seek a third term and a head-to-head matchup with Moore.
So far, the official Republican primary field consists of John Myrick, who previously ran an unsuccessful campaign for U.S. Senate, and Carl A. Brunner Jr., a Carroll firearms instructor. Both formally filed for the GOP nomination.
Hale has yet to formally file, and cannot do so until he picks a running mate.
Two others — freshman Del. Christopher Bouchat (R-Frederick and Carroll) and Carroll County farmer Kurt Wedekind — have said they intend to run. Like Hale, neither has formally filed.
Wiggins moves up at Chamber
Grason M. Wiggins has been promoted to senior vice president of government affairs at the Maryland Chamber of Commerce in recognition of “exceptional leadership” and his role “in delivering one of the most successful legislative sessions in the organization’s recent history,” according to a chamber release.

Wiggins, who joined the chamber in August 2024, “elevated our advocacy to a new level with a clear strategy and strong results,” said chamber President and CEO Mary D. Kane, in announcing the promotion. “Thanks to his leadership, Maryland businesses were protected from a devastating 2.5% services tax, unlimited liability exposure and costly climate mandates.”
The chamber said it “achieved a 93% success rate” in stopping legislation it targeted in the 2025 General Assembly, when it said it connected more than 5,000 business leaders with policymakers and brought more than 400 business leaderss in for testimony and committee engagement.
The chamber also credited Wiggins targeted job fairs and outreach to connect Marylanders with jobs, and strengthening relationships statewide. Before joining the chamber, Wiggins was at Harris Jones & Malone, the Maryland Multi-Housing Association and the Maryland Department of Labor. He holds a J.D. from the University of Baltimore School of Law.
“I’m honored to continue to work with Maryland’s legislators, employers, and workers to ensure our state is generating economic opportunity for every Marylander,” said Wiggins, who will continue to lead chamber advocacy in Annapolis as senior vice president.
Get your scorecards out — it’s already endorsement time
The primary election may still be almost 10 months away, but that hasn’t stopped candidates in the Montgomery County executive race from trotting out the endorsements they have already lined up for the job.
The latest came Wednesday, when Progressive Maryland and Working Families Party announced their support for County Council Vice President Will Jawando (D-At-Large) to receive the Democratic nomination for county executive.
Larry Stafford Jr., executive director of Progressive Maryland, said that in a Democrat-rich county like Montgomery, where the council is all-Democratic, “there’s an important distinction we have to make between Democrats who have a backbone and Democrats who have a spine to stand up straight and walk straight and look with a clear vision to fight on behalf of everyday people. That’s Councilman Will Jawando.”
It came a day after Jawando said his campaign had qualified for the county’s public financing option, raising more than $90,000 from almost 1,000 contributions, least 80% of which came from county residents. He said Wednesday his plafform includes affordable housing, fully funded public schools and a challenge to the Trump administration “recklessly slashing” government funding.

	“We have an opportunity in this election … to show a community where we reject the false narrative that if my neighbor can eat, that I can’t eat,” Jawando said. “That if my neighbor does well and gets rental assistance, it’s going to make my life worse. We can stand up for a community where everyone does well together and reject the divisiveness of Donald Trump.”
But Jawando will face at least two County Council colleagues: Andrew Friedson and Evan Glass (D-At-Large).
Friedson who was endorsed in July by the International Association of Firefighters Local 1446, has also secured the support of some heavyweight state legislators from the county : Senate Majority Leader Nancy King (D-Montgomery) and Sen. Brian Feldman (D-Montgomery), who chairs the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee.
Also this summer, Glass announced the backing of two major Democrats in former Rep. David Trone and former U.S. Secretary of Labor Tom Perez, who called Glass “the effective, progressive leader we need right now to fight against the extreme agenda in Washington that is hurting our community and our country.”
Glass, who was the first openly LGBTQ+ member of the council when elected in 2018, would become the first as county executive, if elected.
Two other Democrats have officially filed the paperwork to seek the nomination for county executive in the June 2026 primary: Celeste Iroha, a registered medical assistant, was the first person to announce in March, according to Bethesda Today, while Mithun Banerjee, a landlord from Silver Spring, filed his candidacy in May.
As of Wednesday afternoon, no Republicans had filed for the seat, according to the state Board of Elections. But candidates have until Feb. 24 to file.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DSC_0010-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-04 06:58:04.174429

Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout ©2025Tennessee is appealing an order by a federal judge that permanently blocked a portion of state law that made it a crime to help minors obtain an out-of-state abortion.
The so-called 2024 “abortion trafficking of a minor” law created a misdemeanor offense for an adult who “intentionally recruits, harbors, or transports a pregnant unemancipated minor” for an abortion or to obtain abortion-inducing drugs for a minor. The law does not apply to parents, guardians and those with their written permission.
The law was challenged in July 2024 by state Rep. Aftyn Behn, a Nashville Democrat and social worker, who has publicly advocated for abortion rights, and Rachel Welty, a Nashville attorney who describes herself as an “advocate for safe and healthy access to abortion care.” 
In July, Senior United States Circuit Judge Julia Gibbons issued a decision permanently enjoining the recruitment portion of the law. Gibbons concluded it was a clear violation of First Amendment rights, noting in her decision that the law criminalizes only one side of speech about abortion.
Tennessee Senate passes bill making it a crime to aid a minor seeking an abortion

The law does not define the term “recruit.” Lawyers for the state argued it meant “a targeted inducement of a minor for a specific purpose — obtaining an elective abortion without her parent’s or guardian’s consent.” Behn and Welty argued it meant “encouragement, persuasion and ‘put(ting) out the word’ that an option was available.”
Either way, Gibbons concluded, the provision was unconstitutional. 
Tennessee’s near total abortion ban, which took effect in 2022, has meant those seeking the procedure have had to travel to states where it remains legal. 
“Tennessee cannot criminalize ‘disseminating information about an activity that is legal in another state,’ wrote Gibbons, who sits on 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals but presided over the Nashville case after several other federal judges recused themselves from the case.
The fate of the recruitment portion of the law now rests with the 6th Circuit after a notice of appeal was filed by the Tennessee Attorney General in late August. 
Nashville attorneys Daniel Horwitz, Melissa Dix and Sarah Martin, who represent the two women who filed the lawsuit, have also filed a “cross appeal,” citing in legal filings precedent for using such appeals as a “backup plan” in case the judgement in the case is reversed.

(Photo courtesy of Devon Young Cupery)An administrative law judge in Madison heard arguments Wednesday in a case contesting Wisconsin’s approval of Enbridge’s proposed Line 5 pipeline reroute. Members of the  public testified, followed by an expert witness in geology and hydrology, who questioned aspects of the reroute plan. 
The lawsuit, brought by Clean Wisconsin and Midwest Environmental Advocates (on behalf of the Sierra Club of Wisconsin, the League of Woman Voters of Wisconsin and 350 Wisconsin), challenges permits allowing the Canadian oil company to move forward with rerouting the Line 5 pipeline around the Bad River reservation in northern Wisconsin. Wednesday’s hearing followed the opening day of testimony in Ashland and was one of a series of hearings  scheduled through early October. The Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa is challenging Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources permits for a Line 5 reroute, which was designed to fix a legal problem with the existing pipeline after a federal court found that it trespasses on tribal land. Attorneys for the Band, environmental groups and Enbridge testified at the hearing.

Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline has been a polarizing issue, with one side arguing that it’s crucial for energy independence and jobs in Wisconsin, while the other points to a history of leaky and ruptured Enbridge pipelines causing ecological damage, a national need to transition away from fossil fuels, and the company’s years-long trespass on the Bad River Band’s sovereign land. 
Public testimony Wednesday drew  people from both sides of the debate. “The loss of Line 5 would have devastating impacts on the propane industry,” said Connor Kaeb, an associate manager with GROWMARK, which Kaeb said is Wisconsin’s fifth largest provider of propane. Kaeb stressed that farmers and northern Wisconsin communities depend on affordable and easily accessible propane. Shutting down Line 5 could cause “immense strain on the entire propane system in the region,” he said. 
Tabitha Faber, who spoke against the pipeline, said that the reroute would cross more than 100 waterways, and that even though it avoids the Bad River Band’s reservation, that the pipeline remains in the Bad River watershed, continuing to endanger the Band’s natural resources. Faber recalled visiting sites along the reroute path and seeing bald eagles and wood turtle  habitats. Faber also said that the pipeline’s construction and operation could wash invasive species into new and sensitive habitats, including within the Bad River reservation. Steve Boas, a Madison resident, also spoke against the project, calling the more than 70-year-old pipeline “an accident waiting to happen.” 
The American Petroleum Institute called the relocation project “essential to maintaining Wisconsin’s energy reliability.” The Institute claimed that rerouting Line 5 will create more than 700 jobs, adding that the pipeline has heated homes and businesses, aided agriculture and enabled transportation for decades “without any issue.” In contrast, Third Act Wisconsin — a group of older Americans concerned about climate and democracy — echoed concerns that Line 5 would threaten high-quality wetlands, the Bad River watershed as a whole and even Lake Superior.

Access to clean water is a crucial asset for Wisconsin, environmental groups testified. Tourism generates $378 million in Bayfield, Ashland, Douglas, and Iron counties, while also supporting 2,846 jobs, all in the area near Line 5, according to Clean Wisconsin. 
“For decades, the Bad River Band has been sounding the alarm about the unprecedented risks posed by Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline,” Ellen Ferwerda, who leads Third Act Wisconsin’s work on Line 5, said in a statement. Despite “a myriad of scientists, economists, environmental groups, and citizens” who’ve spoken out against the pipeline, “the DNR summarily dismissed these concerns and issued a permit allowing Enbridge to begin construction of a reroute around the Bad River Reservation.” 
“It feels like the Bad River Band is being punished for standing up for their legal right to protect the watershed their culture and livelihood has relied on for centuries,” she added. Julia Issacs, co-facilitator of Third Act Wisconsin, said in a statement that “we should be decommissioning old and dangerous pipelines, not investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure.” 
Most of Wednesday’s hearing was dedicated to grilling William Joseph Bonin, a licensed senior geologist with Midwest Geological Consultants. He produced a report in May 2025 that pushed back on assessments made by experts from the DNR and Enbridge. 
Bonin raised a multitude of concerns, particularly around how construction of the pipeline could affect springs, aquifers and groundwater. He pointed to the presence of glacial sediments, which make it difficult to predict how water flow could be affected. Bonin recalled one 2018 project in Minnesota, where a gas pipeline was installed along a roadway near adjacent springs. The springs disappeared, and then other springs showed up in a parking lot on a private property, he said. Springs and aquifers that help feed nearby wetlands and other adjacent habitats could be affected by pipeline construction, he testified, and cutting trenches to construct the pipeline could also lead to increased erosion.

Bonin said the risk of aquifer breaches is higher than what had been assessed, and questioned how the presence of already fractured rock layers could be altered by the use of blasting in constructing the reroute. He also pointed to the possibility of “thermal impacts” to waterways, including high-quality trout streams which are sensitive to temperature changes. “Blasting is going to have a larger impact than the expert reports discussed and the reason for that is the already fractured bedrock was not taken into consideration in the reports,” Bonin said. “The effects of blasts, especially on fracture networks, may be permanent,” he added.  “The basted rock is never going to be restored.” This, in turn, could have a ripple effect on how water moves and behaves in the ground around the pipeline reroute, he testified. 
Attorneys representing the DNR and Enbridge took turns cross-examining Bonin. They discussed knowledge gaps Bonin had regarding the wetland aspects of the permits, and argued that methods like blasting and trenching are very common construction practices for all sorts of projects from pipelines to roads.  Enbridge’s attorney pointed out that, while  Bonin has reviewed and analyzed the effects of blasting, Bonin himself has not worked in the field. 
Another hearing in Madison is scheduled for Friday, Sept. 12, at the Hill Farms State Office Building. On Sept. 15 and 19, there will be  hearings in Ashland at the Northwood Technical College Conference Center, followed by more hearings in Madison on Sept. 22, Sept. 26, Sept. 29 and Oct. 3.

(John Ballance/The Advocate, Pool)Louisiana’s attorney general has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate the death sentence of a convicted murderer who was a week away from turning 18 when he killed a college student. Liz Murrill said she intends to challenge a precedent from 2005 that declared capital punishment for minors unconstitutional. 
The case in question has turned into a focal point in the debate over whether persons convicted of violent crimes as juveniles should be punished as adults.
Murrill said Wednesday she filed a motion with justices to allow the state to execute Dale Dwayne Craig for the Sept. 14, 1992, murder of Kipp Gullett, who was taken at gunpoint and shot to death at a secluded construction site. 
Craig was seven days shy of his 18th birthday when he murdered Gullet, an 18-year-old LSU freshman.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A jury convicted Craig in 1994 and sentenced him to death. But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2005 that administering the death penalty to defendants under age 18 violated the 8th and 14th amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The landmark case, Roper v. Simmons, involved Christopher Simmons, 17, who was convicted of killing Shirley Cook weeks after the two were involved in a minor auto accident.  
In her filing for the Craig case, Murrill told the Supreme Court she considers the Roper precedent “egregiously wrong” but said she recognizes it requires justices to deny her motion. The attorney said she was submitting the motion “for preservation purposes only” so that evidence from the Craig case would be retained for use in her challenge.
Craig and Simmons were among about 70 juvenile defendants nationwide who had their death sentences converted to life in prison without parole after the Roper ruling.
“There is no basis in law or logic for that absurd result,” Murrill said in a news release. 
In May 2023, East Baton Rouge Parish Judge Eboni Johnson Rose granted Craig parole eligibility, citing his record of good behavior and role in prison mentor and rehabilitation programs. 
Murrill’s office has challenged Jones’ action, arguing before the Louisiana Supreme Court last month that the callous nature of Craig’s crime 23 years ago warrants the utmost consequences. There is no timeline for a ruling in that challenge. 
Attorney John Landis, who represented Craig before the Louisiana Supreme Court, could not be reached for comment Wednesday.   
According to court records, Craig and three teen accomplices carjacked Gullett in the parking lot of Kirby Smith dormitory at LSU. After they forced Gullett back into his Ford Bronco, they drove to a construction site south of campus. 
Craig and James Lavigne, 19, took Gullett out of the car, and Lavigne hit Gullet in the head with the butt of a 9 mm handgun. After Gullet collapsed to the ground, Craig kneeled down to fire three shots into his skull at point blank range then stood and shot him again twice. 
Craig told the others he had to kill Gullett because one of the teens had called another by his name.
Gullett’s body was found two days later, and all four suspects were arrested within the next five days.
Lavinge was sentenced to life in prison for second-degree murder. Zebbie Wayne Berthelot, 16, and Roy Maurer, 17, were in the Bronco when Craig was killed. Both pleaded guilty to manslaughter and were issued 20-year prison terms.
All three testified against Craig when he was tried for first-degree murder in exchange for sentence leniency.
Louisiana resumed executions earlier this year after a 15-year hiatus during which the state was unable to secure the drugs needed for lethal executions. Jessie Hoffman, 46, was put to death March 18 at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, becoming the first person in the state put to death using nitrogen gas.
Hoffman was 18 when he kidnapped, raped and murdered 28-year-old Mary “Molly” Elliot, who he abducted from a New Orleans parking deck and then took to rural St. Tammany Parish where he assaulted and killed her.
More than 50 people await execution on Louisiana’s death row.

(Photo by Greg Childress/NC Newsline)The state’s affordable housing needs are getting a boost from federal tax credits, tax-exempt bonds and a state loan program.
The financing will help build and rehab 5,012 privately owned and managed affordable apartments — worth nearly $1.5 billion — in more than two dozen counties, according to the N.C. Housing Finance Agency.
Of the 50 projects that will benefit from the awards, 4,150 apartments are for families and 862 for seniors. As many as 500 apartments will be targeted for people with disabilities. The majority of the apartments will be new buildings but approximately 420 will be preservation projects.

The projects were chosen from among 74 full applications reviewed by the North Carolina  Federal Tax Reform Allocation Committee and selected based on recommendations by the Housing Finance Agency, which administers the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program.

“We’re excited with the results for this year and looking forward to another strong cycle next year,” Scott Farmer, executive director of the N.C. Housing Finance Agency, said. “We’ll just continue to promote affordability. This is housing that’s much needed in all of these communities and anything we can do to support additional resources for housing is a good thing.”
North Carolina faces a shortage of 322,000 rental units through 2029, according to a recent study —  “2024 Housing Supply Gap Analysis, State of North Carolina” — commissioned by N.C. Chamber Foundation, N.C.Home Builders Association and N.C. Realtors. Overall findings show an expected gap of 764,000 total units, including 442,000 units for purchase.

The Low Income Housing Tax Credit program is widely viewed as the nation’s best tool for creating and preserving affordable housing. The awards are administered by states’ housing finance agencies through a competitive application process. The Internal Revenue Service sets general guidelines for the program.
Workforce Housing program awaits legislative funding
Twenty-eight of the selected properties were awarded $34.7 million from the Workforce Housing Loan Program, which was established by the N.C. General Assembly in 2014 to encourage development of apartments using the housing credits in low-income counties and to reduce rents in moderate- and high-income counties.
The Workforce Housing Loan Program isn’t funded moving forward but Farmer said he hopes lawmakers will fund it before the end of the year.
“Without that, the Workforce Housing Loan Program, it’s going to dramatically change where deals will work,” Farmer said “That’s a critical resource for doing properties in low-and moderate-income counties. The Workforce Housing Loan Program was really designed to help some of that funding gap to make deals work better in those more rural communities.”

Affordable housing advocates also are closely watching state lawmakers to see if funding for program is restored when the General Assembly adopts a state budget for the 2025-2027 biennium. Lawmakers passed a “mini budget” in late July to address critical spending needs.
“We want that funding to be restored,” Stephanie Watkins-Cruz, director of housing policy at the N.C. Housing Coalition, said during one of the group’s recent housing calls. “We want to make sure that the projects that are part of next year’s cycle in North Carolina have the gap financing they need.”
The Workforce Housing Loan Program has been funded at $35 million each of the last two years. Funding uncertainty will likely cause developers to skip over rural counties in favor of more financially feasible areas, Watkins-Cruz said. Nearly every new project approved demonstrated a need for gap financing, she said.
“Without the Workforce Housing Loan Program, without this gap financing, we’re putting likely hundreds of units at risk, and this will mean it will limit the ability for affordable housing units and developments to actually happen in rural areas and recovering areas.”
If funding isn’t restored to the program, Watkins-Cruz said more affordable housing will be concentrated in better-heeled urban areas which defeats the program’s purpose.
The Workforce Housing Loan Program is also an essential tool for Hurricane Helene recovery, Watkins-Cuz said.
“Without it, housing in some of the hardest hit areas like Polk, Rutherford, Avery, Watauga and Henderson counties, may not be viable, which impacts the ability of the workforce and community members to return home or remain in the area,” Watkins Cruz said.
Agency loans totaling more than $12.2 were awarded to 11 properties under the Rental Production Program, which uses state and federal funds to improve economic feasibility for rental developments.
The projects awarded federal tax credits and other financing awards are expected to support 21,960 jobs and generate $95.3 million in state and local tax revenue, according to the Housing Finance Agency.
In a post on its website, the N.C. Housing Coalition noted that between 1986 and 2023, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program has stimulated both the state and local economies, generating more than $21.3 billion in wages and business income and more than $7.7 billion in tax revenue for the state.
Since its creation, the Housing Finance Agency has financed more than 321,320 affordable homes and apartments totaling $34.4 billion.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)The number of active voters in Colorado has grown by just under 50,000 between January and July of this year, but more voters are opting to be unaffiliated than register as a Republican or Democrat.
A recent analysis from the New York Times found that Democratic voter registration declined in every state between 2020 and 2024, while in many of those states Republican registrations grew. In Colorado — where a voter does not need to be registered with a party to vote in primary elections — both parties have seen further reductions since the start of 2025.
Both parties saw reductions of total membership in the state of less than 1%, but the number of Democratic party voters declined slightly more than Republican voters. Unaffiliated voter registration across Colorado grew by 3.1%, while Democratic registration dropped by 0.9% and Republican registration dropped by 0.77%.

The vast majority of voters who are registering for the first time or updating their registration do so through automatic voter registration at the Division of Motor Vehicles, according to Aly Belknap, executive director of Common Cause Colorado, a pro-democracy organization with branches in about two dozen states. People who register through the DMV are automatically registered unaffiliated, but Belknap said voters are able to update that to join a party. 
Belknap said voters opting to be unaffiliated aligns with “a trend we’ve seen steadily over the last decade” after Colorado opened up its primaries. Over the last three presidential election cycles, the national approval ratings of the Democratic and Republican parties have reached “historic lows,” she said.

“I think that’s really a driving force for many Coloradans, as well as many Americans because this is a trend that we’re now seeing nationally, even in states with closed primaries,” Belknap said. “This is I think a driving reason why folks are moving away and deciding to register unaffiliated and forge a path on leading with the issues that matter mostly to them and choosing the candidates accordingly.”
Voters’ trust in government is also at a historic low, Belknap said, which affects peoples’ willingness to engage with democracy and elections. 
Unaffiliated voter registrations have been steadily on the rise since November and peaked at 2,029,337 in July, growing by more than 60,000 voters since the start of the year.
Immediately after the November election, Republicans saw a slight uptick in registrations in Colorado between the end of November and December, but the number of voters affiliated with the party have slowly declined each month since. The number of voters registered as Republican hit a high of 943,564 in December and have dropped to 936,002 by the end of July. 
The Colorado Republican Party did not respond to a Newsline request for comment. 
Consistent across congressional districts
The Democratic Party’s high since the November election was at the end of November, when 1,050,789 Colorado voters were registered with the party. Democratic registrations dropped to 1,036,115 in July after gradually declining each month since. 
Voters across the country “are feeling disillusioned and apathetic,” according to Andrew Nicla, Colorado Democratic Party communications director, and “the toxic national discourse has left many questioning whether either party is truly fighting for them.”
“These voter registration numbers are a snapshot, not a sealed fate. Colorado Democrats didn’t blow a $1.2 billion hole in our state budget or cut health care and food assistance for working families,” Nicla said, referencing the federal tax and spending bill’s effect on Colorado’s budget. “There is a clear contrast between our vision, and the damage done by Colorado Republicans in Congress and in our state.”
Party affiliations are consistent across Colorado’s eight congressional districts, too. 
In Colorado’s battleground 8th Congressional District, where Republican U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans defeated former Democratic U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo by less than a full percentage point, the number of Democratic-affiliated voters has decreased more than the number of Republican-affiliated voters has: Between January and July, the district has seen a 0.06% reduction in registered Republican voters compared to a 0.33% reduction in registered Democratic voters. 
A priority over the next 10-15 years will be to implement automatic voter registration through Medicaid, Belknap said, meaning people seeking Medicaid in Colorado would “have the same benefit as folks who are getting a driver’s license.” The Colorado Legislature approved a bill that would have implemented that process in 2019, but the federal government has not made the changes needed to allow it. 
While political parties and candidates may not be engaging with voters as much during an off year, Belknap said nonpartisan voter registration organizations are still out within the community registering voters, but not pushing for any particular party. She would “love to see the voter registration numbers continue to increase” going into 2026 when there are more local and national elections on the ballot, both in the spring and fall, she said.

In a state so heavily dependent on coal, expansion into artificial intelligence could be a means of diversification. But WVU understands that AI has great potential for good — or evil. In this vein, last year the legislature created an AI Task Force in the governor’s office, consisting of legislators, cybersecurity and others. It is tasked with developing “best practices,” as well as general monitoring of the industry.
AI should not be a partisan issue. The authors have very different views of the world. One of us is a Republican, the other a Democrat. One has a military background; the other does not. But we agree on basics, including — a) we should all be able to exchange ideas in a peaceful and respectful manner and b) there are numerous pressing issues facing our nation which must be addressed in a bi-partisan fashion.
One such issue is AI development which will evolve positively or negatively for humankind. We should all be concerned about AI taking our jobs and even destroying our civilization.
Mechanize is a San Francisco start-up founded by young AI experts. A co-founder stated, “We want to get to a fully automated economy and make that happen as fast as possible.”  He is talking about white collar jobs.
One of the founders said he expects it to take 10-20 years while the other two think 30 years is more realistic. The effects on the social fabric of our society do not appear to be a consideration. They apparently have no concern for developing a social safety net or the impact on humankind. Their only concern is to make current jobs obsolete as quickly as possible. That is efficient — but also very irresponsible, unethical and immoral. Clearly, there has not been enough scientific analysis of this topic.
And the Mechanize folks are not the only ones who see this coming. Per the CEO of Amazon, “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.” 
Combining AI with quantum computing is imminent but concerning. “A quantum is the smallest possible discrete unit of any physical property. It usually refers to properties of atomic or subatomic particles.” Each amplifies the other’s strength creating perhaps the most transformative technology ever. 
Quantum computers can process vast combinations of data. The power of quantum computers far exceeds that of our current computers. The concern is “Will the combination of AI and quantum computers eventually go rogue?” Watch the 1984 film “Terminator” again to get one possible answer to that question. The film, in large part, demonstrates the potential danger of unconstrained artificial intelligence. In that film, a future AI network attempts to go back in time to trigger a nuclear war with the goal of permanently ending humankind.
Developers are addressing the risks of rogue AI behavior with a mix of technical safeguards, organizational practices and policy simulations including:

Guardrails and alignment techniques to ensure AI systems behave in line with human values.
Crisis response protocols to try to intervene when needed.

But the many unregulated AI models could easily create toxic compounds. Deepfakes, impersonations, cyberattacks and even drone manipulation can be used by a bad actor in a garage or basement.
Experts are using simulations to make AI behave badly thus identifying issues. And results are very frightening:  

AI models are increasingly evading safeguards via deception.
Models chose blackmail to pursue their goals.
Some models were willing to cut off the oxygen supply of a worker if the system was at risk of being shut down, even if instructed otherwise.

Developers aren’t in agreement as to how AI should be tested and controlled to prevent rogue behavior. There’s growing consensus on the need for safeguards, but the methods, priorities, and philosophies vary widely across organizations and countries. Plus, there are far too many developers and countries involved to enforce constraints worldwide. A foolproof kill switch must be required for all AI applications. However, it currently doesn’t exist.
We don’t want to sound alarmist, but Paul Revere might have had a point — except it is AI instead of the British. Our future depends upon how humans choose to develop an entity that has potential to reshape or eliminate civilization. Our defense hinges upon being prepared, layered defenses, and rapid coordination — all of which seem woefully deficient at present.
Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, has stated, “AI is likely to be either the best or worst thing to happen to humanity.” What we do now could literally be vital for the survival of humanity. Instead of our political leaders in West Virginia and Washington, D.C. arguing about cultural flashpoints like trans athletes and pronouns, our nation should be addressing the pending AI crisis in a bipartisan manner.

The health of U.S. children has deteriorated since the early 2000s across a range of measures, researchers from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California, Los Angeles found. They published their findings in July in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.
U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.
For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.
Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy  countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.
To improve infant and child health, the authors of the op-ed proposed antipoverty measures such as child tax credits; social media restrictions; broader health insurance coverage; more investment in primary care; and more restrictive firearm laws.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-949097222-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-04 05:57:31.445554

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)If you’re wondering what the shelf life is for us to care about school shootings, the answer is five days.
On Wednesday, Aug. 27, Annunciation Church in Minneapolis was filled with grade-schoolers to celebrate the first day of school when a shooter opened fire from outside. A 10-year-old boy told reporters, “It was like, shots fired and then we kind of like got under pews. They shot through the stained glass windows, I think, and it was really scary.” He then described how he’d done active shooter drills in school but never in church.
A few weeks ago in Louisville, a woman was shot to death while walking a child to the school bus stop. This followed a shooting at a Louisville bus stop the previous week when shots were fired and, luckily, no one was injured. 
Ask yourself how long it takes for you to move on from the horror of schoolchildren being shot at or shot to death before an internet flood of news and social media washes it away: vaccines on hold at the CDC, Gavin Newsom tweeting “good night, grandpa!” at the president, troops on the streets of D.C and heading to Chicago, the great Cracker Barrel logo kerfuffle.
In addition to thoughts and prayers, Republican talking points after a school shooting now include hardening schools (i.e., provide more draconian security measures, like a prison) and that we need to address mental health. 
Let’s start with mental health. This year in the Kentucky legislature, Senate Bill 235 was filed, a repeat-filing of 2024’s Senate Bill 13 to temporarily remove firearms from those in a mental health crisis. 
Neither bill received a single hearing. Why? Because there was zero public pressure to do so.
Republicans also say that we need to harden schools, but our schools are already hardened. We have school resource officers. Doors are deliberately locked. Many have camera surveillance. There are strict lockdown procedures and our kids are required to practice hiding and being silent to save their own lives from a shooter beginning in pre-school.
A school administrator recently described to me how sickening it feels to run these drills, to grab the intercom and yell, “LOCKDOWN, LOCKDOWN, LOCKDOWN” while hearing doors slam and lock and the school building go silent. 
Our kids are being terrorized and shot to death in school, in churches, on school athletic fields and at the bus stop. Consider the absurdity of “hardening schools.” Would a prison-like atmosphere promote the joy of learning? How do you harden a football field on a Friday night? Do we need to cover the stained glass in school churches with bulletproof glass? Shall we design bulletproof cages around the bus stops? 
Call your representatives, they say, call your congressman, write to your legislators.
There was a church shooting in Lexington this summer in which two were killed and two seriously injured. On July 21 at 3:42 p.m. I emailed leadership in Frankfort — Senate President Robert Stivers and President Pro Tem David Givens, House Speaker David Osborne and Speaker Pro Tem David Meade — writing in part, “Every year, several gun violence prevention bills are filed in good faith by members of both parties. And those bills never see the light of day because leadership buries those bills, bills that could save lives. James 2:26 — ‘For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.’”
I received no response.
Following school shootings and other mass shootings, Republican lawmakers regularly go on television to say “it’s not the guns, we need to address mental health.” So, why are mental health bills related to gun violence rarely, if ever, considered?
Because House and Senate leadership — not your representative lawmakers — decide which bills get a hearing; leaders at the state level are beholden to the national party; national party leaders are beholden to the gun lobby; and the gun lobby represents gun companies who want to do what? Sell more guns, make more money, donate money to the Republican Party.
This is how government works. This is why elections matter.
The shooting at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis happened on the first day of school, a Wednesday. I emailed my national editor about doing a story, and he said he’d get back to me on Friday. But Friday was the start of Labor Day weekend, so we did not connect until Tuesday morning. 
By Tuesday, five days had passed. Tuesday was too late. The news cycle moved on because the American public moved on. 
Our time limit for caring about kids getting shot to death in school is five days.

Education leaders and critics said that while they understand the need to raise expectations, they are concerned that the results of adjusting cut scores — used to determine whether K-12 students are meeting proficiency levels — could negatively impact equitable access to education, lead to teacher burnout, and decrease graduation rates.
Before seeking the Board of Education’s final approval, VDOE stated at the board’s Aug. 28 business meeting that it plans to provide a modeling and impact analysis using this year’s assessment results to determine how each school division would have performed under the proposed recommended cut scores. 
The objective, established by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration, is to better align the cut scores with the rigor of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) to help students improve their thinking skills and use different skills together when solving problems.
The action is part of a larger plan approved by the General Assembly and Youngkin to revise the state Standard of Learning  assessments (SOLs) but it has met pushback from some including school division superintendents who say they don’t have enough information about the process.
“Without a thorough understanding of how these cut scores were developed and determined and their impact, our students, parents and educators will not have the transparency needed to fully embrace these new goals,” Scott Brabrand, executive director of the Virginia Association of School Superintendents, said at the board’s Aug. 28 business meeting.
During the spring, a standards-setting committee comprising teachers and instructional specialists was established to develop cut-score recommendations for review by the Board of Education in June, with a final decision anticipated in July.
In response, Board of Education President Grace Creasey, a Youngkin appointee, told the Mercury that the work was not completed under the leadership of former superintendent Lisa Coons, who resigned in mid-March.
“The work was never done and that was uncovered,” Creasey said, adding that once the board and agency started the process of setting new standards, they realized “going to look for that work, it hadn’t been done.”
However, Creasey said she believes the board will approve the cut scores no later than October. The board’s subsequent two business meetings are on Sept. 25 and Oct. 23.

 The recommendations

As projected, the standards setting committee and Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson proposed a significant number of proficiency increases, mostly for reading.
A score of 400 has been the standard for passing the assessments for several years.
However, in grade 4 reading, the committees recommended increasing the proficiency minimum to 444, up from 400. The superintendent recommended raising it to 449. In Algebra I, the committees recommended increasing the proficiency minimum to 445, up from 400. The superintendent recommended raising it to 453.
The updated performance standards will not take effect until spring 2026.
Carol Bauer, president of the Virginia Education Association, said in a statement that the association has been calling on the board “for months” to model how the proposed cut score changes would impact graduation rates. She added that after other states adjusted their cut scores, they found “measurable impacts” and that Virginia can run a similar analysis. 
“It’s indefensible that the board refuses to look at the data and it suggests an unwillingness to face the real impact these changes could have on Virginia’s students,” Bauer said.
VASS, in its statement last week, urged the agency and board to publicly share the full methodology, modeling, and impact analysis of the proposed SOL cut score changes before making any final decision.
They also requested that the state hold harmless graduating seniors taking the assessment test this year, considering the proposed higher score requirements. VASS said under the proposed plan to change the scores needed to pass, students who take their exams in the fall might have different score requirements compared to those who take the same tests in the spring.
The association is also asking the agency to clarify the proposed changes to the mathematics SOL test scores, including the number of items that need to be correct to achieve proficiency on each test, and how they align with the recently passed legislation on mathematics placement, and ask that the locally verified credit score of 375 remain in alignment across all grades and courses.
While the agency prepares an analysis for the board and public, Gullickson said school divisions can use last year’s assessment data to draw their comparisons. She said members of the agency will also meet with division leaders to address questions and “really make sure that they understand what the differences are in data, (and) where the supports are needed.”
Gullickson added, “We want to really take in both the requests from the board, requests from public comment, and others who have just said, ‘can we just make sure that this rollout is really thoughtful.’”
Regarding the concerns about the cut scores, Creasey stated that she does not expect the “drastic hits” that are prompting outcry from some education leaders, parents and advocates. 
“Former board members continue to beat the drum that if we make these changes, kids are going to fail, they’re not going to pass, they’re not going to graduate,” Creasey said. “I just don’t think that’s the case at the level that has been expressed.”

A shortage of new homes is driving continued high housing costs, casting doubt on Virginia's future growth. (Photo by Parker Michels-Boyce/Virginia Mercury)On Thursday, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, helped launch the latest congressional effort to create more affordable housing solutions in the commonwealth and across the country by introducing the Yes In God’s Backyard Act. The measure would allow faith-based organizations to develop housing on unused land they already own and help fund the effort.
A 2020 legislative study found that nearly a third of Virginia households spend over 30% of their income on housing costs, and there’s a severe lack of affordable housing options statewide. Housing stock has not kept pace with population growth, a state study found. Housing affordability and supply issues are most often locally-rooted, but with an estimated shortage of 4.5 million homes in America according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Warner’s measure has national relevance. 
If it were to become law, the bill would provide technical assistance and grants for faith-based organizations, higher education institutions, and local governments that want to increase the supply of affordable rental housing by constructing or preserving it on their property. Households “at or below 60% of area median income” levels, along with people who are “homeless or at risk of homelessness, including veterans” would be key beneficiaries of the programs.
The logic is that faith-based organizations like churches, synagogues, and mosques or nonprofits in some cases already own underdeveloped land that could be filled in with housing. Some higher education institutions may also be in similar positions. The law would also help these groups bypass barriers by “assessing and removing local policy and procedural barriers to and adopting best practices to encourage the development of affordable rental housing,” in localities.
“If we want to make housing more affordable, we need to get creative and take advantage of opportunities that already exist,” Warner said in a statement. “The YIGBY Act is about breaking down barriers and giving faith communities and colleges the support they need to put their land to work creating safe, affordable homes.”
Like-minded efforts were introduced at the state level in Virginia in recent years, but they did not survive the 2025 legislative session. 
A bill from Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield — who is also running for lieutenant governor — and Sen. Kannan Srinivasan, D- Loudoun, would have granted localities the authority to adopt strategies to encourage affordable housing development on properties that religious organizations or nonprofits own. The idea was later scrapped by the Senate’s finance committee.
Many housing policy decisions in Virginia are made at the local level, so state lawmakers have presented a series of successful and unsuccessful measures to encourage development without overstepping local authority. 
Lawmakers at all levels of government continue exploring policy that might spur or speed up development, with Virginia housing experts and lawmakers weighing in. 
Greta Harris, CEO of Richmond-based Better Housing Coalition, told Congress last summer that housing pinches can also strain local economies. 
“Businesses in both urban and rural areas struggle to attract and retain talent because workers can’t afford to live nearby,” she said. 
After Warner unveiled other housing-supply proposals this summer, state Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, noted that solutions can be “solved fastest if all three levels of government are working together, and each level of government can bring something different.”

(Photo by Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)The Trump administration has given notice that political appointees, rather than scientists, will ultimately decide who gets grant money from the world’s largest biomedical research funder — the federal government’s National Institutes of Health.
In an Aug. 7 executive order, President Donald Trump announced that political officers would have the power to summarily cancel any federal grant, including for scientific work, that is not “consistent with agency priorities.” Senior officials should not “routinely defer” to recommendations from peer reviewers, who have provided the backbone of federal science funding for eight decades.
NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya reinforced the message in an Aug. 15 internal memorandum stating that political priorities may override the scoring system provided by outside experts appointed to hundreds of review panels.
“While the score and critiques an application receives in peer review are important factors in determining the scientific merit of a proposal,” his memo stated, NIH institutes and centers should not rely on the scientific merit rankings “in developing their final pay plans.”
Like ongoing conflicts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Federal Reserve, NIH scientists told KFF Health News, the disruption of the peer review process represents an attack on agency expertise that the country has relied on for decades.
Although the priorities of top agency staffers have always influenced some NIH funding, those people were nearly always career scientists in the past. By downgrading its peer review process, the NIH could allow political appointees who now occupy key positions to stop grants that typically would be funded, and to fund grants they prefer that don’t necessarily meet rigorous scientific standards, a dozen current and former NIH officials told KFF Health News.
Bhattacharya’s guidelines “open the door to the politicization of NIH research,” said Jenna Norton, a program officer in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
“Peer review is fundamental and makes sure we’re doing the best science,” she said. “If you’re going to ignore that, the political appointee gets to make the final call.”
NIH spokesperson Amanda Fine said that peer review would continue to be the cornerstone of the NIH’s funding decisions but that funding would become less dependent on reviewers’ rankings of grant proposals.
This will “ensure consistent, transparent, and strategic funding decisions that align with the agency’s mission, maximize public health impact, and responsibly steward taxpayer dollars,” she said. Trump’s executive order said peer reviews would be “advisory” only.
Grants to scientists at universities and other research centers make up about 80% of the NIH’s $48 billion budget, with the rest funding internal NIH research. Since 1946, the NIH has doled out funds based mainly on merits established by a scientific review process that ranks each proposal based on innovation, importance and feasibility.
The peer review process, in which grant proposals scoring above a certain percentile generally receive funding, has always had its critics. Many a Nobel Prize speech has described failures by reviewers to recognize work that would end up leading to pathfinding discoveries, said Carrie Wolinetz, a former NIH chief of staff.
About half of the NIH’s 27 centers and institutes provide leeway to raise or drop grants on the priority list because of factors like institute-wide research goals, Fine said. But these exceptions apply to fewer than 5% of grants, according to Richard Nakamura, who led the NIH’s Center for Scientific Review from 2011 to 2018.
Nakamura’s successor, Noni Byrnes, retired last week after overseeing changes aimed at reducing one frequent target of peer review critics: the awarding of multiple grants to well-placed scientists from top-tier universities.
The Bhattacharya document “itself is not so disturbing in the light of usual practice,” said Harold Varmus, who led the NIH under President Bill Clinton and was the chief of the National Cancer Institute under Barack Obama. “What is disturbing is what it might mean in the context of the current administration.”
The expansion of the Trump administration’s political power at the NIH comes as it has strangled the release of thousands of grants with sometimes ambiguous policy statements and new layers of bureaucracy, including requirements that both the White House and the NIH director clear all new funding opportunities.
Career scientists, who have long run the NIH, have in some instances been replaced by political appointees playing critical roles in scientific decisions, staff scientists say.
New political appointees under Bhattacharya include chief of staff Seana Cranston, a former aide to conservative Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), and former Department of Government Efficiency manager James McElroy, Cranston’s deputy. The position of chief operations officer was created and filled by Eric Schnabel, a political appointee — since fired — who previously had been in charge of business development for a company that sold fitness programs.
Bhattacharya’s deputy, meanwhile, is Matthew Memoli, an infectious disease scientist who emerged as a sharp critic of covid-19 vaccine mandates. The Department of Health and Human Services stunned vaccine experts in May when it awarded Memoli and colleagues a $500 million grant to develop an influenza vaccine using older technology, with no explanation other than a superlative-filled news release.
The mood at the agency is morbid, said Sylvia Chou, a program officer at the National Cancer Institute. While a minority of workers speak out in protest through documents like the “Bethesda Declaration,” others keep their heads down and their mouths shut.
Most grants must undergo new levels of review by senior NIH employees and the White House, program officers say. Staff members painstakingly police all grant applications for language — such as “diversity” or “climate change” — that might trigger scrutiny by higher-ups, according to four program officers, two of whom KFF Health News agreed not to name because they feared retaliation.
“Bhattacharya has been saying that program officers are making up banned-words lists,” Norton said. “It’s true, we haven’t gotten a list from him saying, ‘Don’t use these words.’ But we do notice that when a grant says ‘health equity,’ it gets terminated.”
“We review them and screen them for all these words as we’re supposedly not doing — but we are doing,” said a program officer who has been at the NIH for six years. “After we approve them, they go to the grant management office and sit there. Then they send them back and say, ‘What about this word?’” This leads to self-censorship, the officer said.
The officer cited a recent proposal involving the effects of hotter weather on kidney disease. It contained the phrase “climate change” as background information, but “I had them remove it,” the officer said. “It’s a level of absurdity, but I wanted to avoid more delays.”
The peer review process itself is “starting to break down” because highly scored grants haven’t been funded for sometimes obscure reasons, Chou said.
The NIH picks hundreds of deeply experienced external scientists to serve on its review panels. While screened to avoid conflicts of interest, many reviewers are themselves NIH grant recipients. They accept pay of about $200 for 100 hours of work as a kind of social contract with the NIH, said Mollie Manier, a scientist at the Center for Scientific Review.
“We’re finding that people are more likely to decline to serve on review panels because their own grants are frozen, or out of protest at what’s happening at NIH,” Manier said.
Another review officer described approaching a Brown University scientist with a request to serve on a panel recently: “They said normally they would do it, but they’ve lost three grants and need to figure out how to keep their lab running.”
As grants crawl through the system, “reviewers are starting to feel they aren’t being convened for anything real,” Manier said. “If the government cancels your grant for no good reason, you can’t expect a good-faith effort anymore.”
“It’s death by a thousand paper cuts, anything they can do to gum up payments, to gum up the decision-making, to wrest control of grant decisions from the career scientists,” said Elizabeth Ginexi, an NIH program officer for 22 years who took early retirement in April.
Fine, the NIH spokesperson, said the agency had “no evidence that recruiting peer reviewers has become more difficult than in the past.”
The administration’s skepticism of peer review feeds doubts NIH scientists already had because of what they saw as irrational villainizing of mRNA vaccines and other matters — including Memoli’s vaccine award.
Although in-house NIH research isn’t subject to the same review process as external grants, Memoli’s grant left officials aghast. “I’m not aware of a process that awards $500 million for a project using antiquated technology to develop vaccines,” one seasoned reviewer said.
Trump’s executive order says the grant review process “undermines the interests of American taxpayers,” leaving many good proposals unfunded while supporting “too much unfocused research of marginal social utility.”
“The opposite is true,” the seasoned reviewer said. “We make sure taxpayer money goes to the most high-impact research.”
“Alignment” is a word the Trump administration frequently uses to explain why an official got fired or research was rejected. Chou finds it appalling.
“The Chinese Communists call it ‘harmonization,’” she said, and now her colleagues speak routinely about grants that are “clean” because they’ve “gone through alignment.”
“We’re saying this in plain English,” she said. “Not Russian, not Beijing Chinese.”

On Aug. 29, a Parma police officer was stationed outside St. Columbkille, a Catholic elementary and middle school in the Cleveland suburbs. School administrators called them out of an abundance of caution to provide security after the Minnesota tragedy.
Two children died and 17 others were injured after a shooter opened fire on praying kids, reigniting the long-standing debate on how to fix the country’s problem of mass shootings.
It’s a nightmare situation, one that former teacher of 30 years Sean Brennan couldn’t talk about without tears.
“This was not something that I thought about when I was going through my teacher preparation,” Brennan said. “When we became teachers, we didn’t sign up to think that we were gonna have to potentially save our children from a shooter, for Pete’s sake.”
Brennan, now a Democratic state lawmaker representing Parma, said the answer includes background checks and red flag laws.
“There’s got to be some type of common-sense restrictions on owning guns,” he said.
The city of Dayton’s deadly mass shooting in 2019 prompted Gov. Mike DeWine to push for new safety regulations, but the Republican-dominated legislature never took them up. On Thursday, WEWS asked the governor what could be done now.
“We put together, a few years ago, in our public safety office, really a separate unit about school safety — and so we can go out to any school, give them an assessment,” the governor said. “We also have some money that we can help schools (with). It doesn’t guarantee that we’ll never have a shooting there, but what it does do is make sure that the school is prepared for anything.”
Ohio can do better, he said, but knows he faces an uphill battle with his own party.
“Look, I’ve tried some different things,” DeWine said. “And we’ve not gotten them through.”
What has gotten through includes safety protocols that state Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, said don’t infringe on the Second Amendment, like providing funding for more security at religious buildings and allowing educators to be armed in class.
“We’re going to have to provide more security,” Cirino said. “We’re going to have to utilize people that are available: retired policemen, retired military people who are properly trained and vetted.”
Blaming firearms doesn’t get to the core problem, Cirino said.
“The guns are the method used by people that are psychologically impaired, okay?” Cirino said. “We need to address the core issue, which is the psychological impairment in the first place.”
While other GOP leaders push the constitutional argument, Cirino is more focused on families being cognizant of their relatives, including the “parental responsibility for flagging potential problems earlier and monitoring their children better, and alerting law enforcement when there seems to be something that has a high probability of becoming very violent.”
The Republican said he would “like to see” some “tighter restrictions” in terms of people getting guns, possibly waiting longer.
Brennan said that both his and Cirino’s solutions should go together.
“It’s got to be an all arrows and the quiver type of approach,” Brennan said.
Some Democrats and advocates are now pushing for a constitutional amendment to put gun safety regulations into law.
DeWine said he doesn’t know what regulations he would call for at this time, with Brennan expressing disappointment that despite the governor’s repeated interest in gun safety, he has signed each bill loosening gun restrictions sent to his desk.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)WASHINGTON — Inside a bustling Union Station, commuters and tourists breeze past armed military personnel patrolling in groups of three or four as part of President Donald Trump’s surge of National Guard troops and federal agents into the nation’s capital.
Outside on a recent weekday afternoon, Robin Galbraith stood among a handful of people protesting their presence. The retired schoolteacher from nearby Bethesda, Maryland, held a sign saying Trump is “afraid” of free and fair elections.
“We should be respecting our National Guard. We should be respecting our citizens. We should be respecting our cities,” Galbraith said. “We shouldn’t be using them as pawns for Mr. Trump to have power because he’s feeling vulnerable right now.”
Trump’s decision to put the National Guard on the streets of Los Angeles and Washington in recent months and his threat to send them into other major cities have sparked a nationwide fight over the proper role of the Army’s and Air Force’s primary combat reserve force. Trump this week signaled Chicago or New Orleans could be next.
Republican and Democratic governors, who command the National Guard in their states, are sharply divided over whether to deploy servicemembers in furtherance of Trump’s agenda. Their decisions could shape how the nationwide military force, which counts some 430,000 members, is used for years to come.
Six GOP governors have signed off on sending troops to Washington, while at least 10 have ordered National Guard members to help U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. Many Democratic governors oppose any plans to send troops into their cities, and Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, has urged all governors to reject the temptation to aid a “dangerous, politically motivated agenda.”

Trump and his allies say the National Guard is aiding a necessary crackdown on crime and bolstering immigration enforcement. But Democrats and military experts warn that the White House is trampling on longtime norms against the domestic use of the military and normalizing the presence of soldiers on America’s streets. They add that no crime crisis exists that is sufficient to justify sending in Guard members.
A federal judge in California on Tuesday agreed, ruling that Trump’s deployment of troops to Los Angeles had violated a 19th-century law that restricts the domestic use of the military. The case could eventually end up before the U.S. Supreme Court.
Some Trump administration critics fear troops could be used to intimidate protesters or voters during the 2026 midterm elections. At the very least, they say, Trump risks politicizing the National Guard — transforming it from an apolitical force associated with providing aid after natural disasters into something closer to another arm of the Trump administration.











I think it is a misuse of the National Guard to try to use the National Guard in this fashion.


– Retired Air Force Reserve Maj. Gen. F. Andrew Turley



“I think it is a misuse of the National Guard to try to use the National Guard in this fashion,” said F. Andrew Turley, a former Air Force Reserve major general who retired in 2012 and once served as an Air National Guard assistant to the Judge Advocate General of the Air Force.
The National Guard has two primary missions, Turley said: training for active-duty military service and serving as a state militia commanded by governors, available after natural disasters. Using National Guard members for law enforcement is beyond what they’re trained for and what they’re interested in, he said.
“Many members are going to shake their heads and say, ‘This is not what we’re here for, this is not what we signed up for,’” Turley said.
Broader scope of duties
But Trump and several Republican governors have embraced an expanded role for the National Guard.
For Trump, the troops — camo-clad and sometimes carrying weapons — offer a visually striking way of projecting power. For the governors, signing National Guard members up for stints in Washington, D.C., or helping ICE offers a way to demonstrate support for the commander in chief.
“South Carolina is proud to stand with President Trump as he works to restore law and order to our nation’s capital and ensure safety for all who live, work, and visit there,” South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, said in a statement last month as he announced the deployment of 200 members of his state’s National Guard to Washington.
At least five other Republican-controlled states have also announced plans to send troops there: Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia. About 2,000 National Guard members are now in the district, a figure that also includes members of the D.C. National Guard.
For now, the servicemembers appear mostly stationed in high-visibility areas, such as the National Mall and Union Station, with relatively little to do. Video of National Guard members picking up trash recently gained widespread attention. However, “presence patrols” are planned in the future for residential areas, the D.C. National Guard announced last week.

Nearly 80% of district residents oppose Trump taking control of local police and the deployment of the National Guard, according to a mid-August poll conducted by The Washington Post and the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. More broadly, a Reuters poll of Americans last month found just 38% support for the National Guard deployment in the nation’s capital.
“We are based in a society where we believe that the members of the military are not deployed against our own citizens,” former Kansas Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius said in an interview.
Sebelius’ father, John Gilligan, was elected governor of Ohio in 1970 in the wake of the shootings at Kent State University, where the Ohio National Guard killed four student protesters and wounded nine others. Sebelius said she has enormous respect for National Guard members, but warned against placing them in an urban environment they haven’t trained for and where they aren’t wanted.
“It’s dangerous for them, it’s dangerous for the citizens,” Sebelius said.
After West Virginia Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced in August he would send 300-400 National Guard members to Washington, opponents of the deployment sued in West Virginia state court. The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia filed a complaint on behalf of West Virginia Citizen Action Group, which advocates for a clean environment and open government.
The complaint alleges West Virginia law allows the governor to deploy the National Guard outside of the state only for specific purposes, such as training and active-duty military service, and that the Washington deployment doesn’t qualify. “The Governor cannot transform our citizen-soldiers into a roving police force available at the whim of federal officials who bypass proper legal channels,” the complaint says.
Blue states fear invasion by red-state National Guard troops for deportations

The lawsuit is pending. Morrisey press secretary Drew Galang wrote in an email to Stateline that the governor mobilized the National Guard at the request of Trump under the authority of federal law.
“West Virginia is proud to support our neighbors and the Commander-in-Chief when called upon,” Galang wrote.
Deployments challenged
Trump faces fewer legal obstacles deploying National Guard members in Washington than he would in sending troops to Chicago or other cities. Because the district isn’t a state, the president can deploy the National Guard there with relative ease.
Deployments elsewhere have already proven more legally challenging.
When Trump wanted to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles in June, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom objected. Trump federalized — or took control of — the California National Guard and ordered some 4,000 troops into the city anyway, along with hundreds of U.S. Marines.
Newsom sued over the deployment, leading to a bench trial in August before U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer, a Clinton appointee and the younger brother of former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.
On Tuesday, Breyer ruled that Trump violated the Posse Comitatus Act, passed by Congress in 1878 to limit the use of the military to enforce the law following the end of Reconstruction. While the act allows the military to quell rebellions, the judge found none had occurred in Los Angeles.
Breyer issued an order blocking Trump from deploying the National Guard or any military troops for law enforcement but stayed the order until Sept. 12, giving the Trump administration time to appeal the decision. About 300 National Guard members remain in Los Angeles.
Claire Finkelstein, a professor of law and philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania who studies military ethics and national security law, emphasized in an interview that the military is trained to neutralize threats to the country and to the U.S. Constitution — not to engage in police work.
Finkelstein, who co-authored an amicus brief submitted in the California lawsuit, said that when it comes to maintaining a sharp division between military operations and civilian law enforcement, as well as preserving military readiness, the domestic deployments are a mistake.
“What is the point of them? The real point of them is a show of force to bring Democratic governors who represent a threat to the authority of Donald Trump under the control of the federal government,” Finkelstein said in an interview before Breyer’s decision.

The outcome of an appeal in the California lawsuit could go far in determining how much power Trump has to deploy troops to other cities in the future. Trump signed an executive order last week directing Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to make a National Guard “quick reaction force” available for deployment nationwide, the latest signal the president intends to send troops elsewhere.
The executive order directs Hegseth to designate “an appropriate number” of National Guard members from each state to be available for rapid mobilization.
“They need help badly. Chicago desperately needs help,” Trump said in the Oval Office after signing the order.
On Wednesday, Trump said his administration is weighing whether to deploy to Chicago or New Orleans.
Cities respond to Trump’s sanctuary threats as judge extends protection from threatened cuts

Trump has cast the potential deployments as part of a wide-ranging effort to fight crime and has disparaged major cities as crime-ridden, even as violent offenses continue to fall. Homicides and several other serious offenses, including gun assaults and carjackings, dropped during the first half of 2025 across 42 U.S. cities, continuing a downward trend that began in 2022, according to a report released in July by the nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice.
Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker and local leaders in Democratic-controlled Chicago acknowledge crime remains an issue. But they say progress is being made and the situation certainly doesn’t warrant a military deployment.
Pritzker told reporters on Tuesday that he had reason to believe the Trump administration was positioning Texas National Guard members for potential deployment to Illinois — an extraordinary move that would represent one state sending its armed forces into another state without consent. Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s office has disputed Pritzker’s assertion.
Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson on Saturday signed an executive order aimed at resisting any military deployment. It prohibits Chicago police from participating in law enforcement efforts with the National Guard or other troops, and urges any federal agents to not wear masks, a response to ICE, whose personnel have begun masking during the Trump administration.
“Calling the military into a U.S. city to invade our streets and neighborhoods, to disrupt the lives of everyday people, is an extraordinary action and it should require extraordinary justification,” Pritzker said at an outdoor news conference last week in Chicago. “Look around you right now. Does this look like an emergency?”
Guards in GOP states helping ICE
As Chicago braces for the possible arrival of troops, Democratic governors across the country are also growing more outspoken against Trump’s threatened deployments.
Last week, the Democratic Governors Association released a statement signed by 19 governors accusing Trump of politicizing the military and undermining governors’ power over state national guards.
“This chaotic federal interference in our states’ National Guard must come to an end,” the statement reads.
For their part, several Republican governors are mobilizing their states’ national guards to aid the Trump administration. But so far, those efforts have largely focused on helping deportation efforts in their own states as opposed to preparing for big-city deployments elsewhere.
The Republican Governors Association didn’t respond to a request for comment, but several Republican governors’ offices confirmed to Stateline that their state National Guard has begun assisting ICE in their states. More than 10 states are providing some level of National Guard assistance to ICE: Alabama, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.
US crime rates fell nationwide in 2024, FBI report says

In most states, National Guard members are providing administrative, logistical and other backroom support and not directly participating in immigration enforcement operations. But in at least four states — Florida, Louisiana, Texas and West Virginia — they have been empowered to take part in enforcement operations, according to research by the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law at the University of Pennsylvania.
Governors in those states have entered into federal 287(g) agreements that allow ICE to delegate some immigration enforcement duties, potentially including arrests, to National Guard members. While 287(g) refers to a federal law in place for decades, the second Trump administration has encouraged state and local law enforcement to participate. An agreement is also pending with the Arkansas National Guard, according to ICE records.
In Texas, the largest of those states, Abbott has been an enthusiastic participant. In an email, Abbott press secretary Andrew Mahaleris wrote that the governor supports using “every tool and strategy” to aid deportations by the Trump administration and had directed all state agencies to coordinate with the administration.
“Texas will continue to assist the Trump Administration in arresting, detaining, and deporting illegal immigrants,” Mahaleris wrote.
In Republican-led states where governors have yet to mobilize the National Guard, advocates for immigrants are urging them to hold off. As Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe considers using his state’s National Guard, for example, Susie Johnson, treasurer of advocacy group Abide in Love Ste. Genevieve, said a deployment would do little good.
The local jail in Ste. Genevieve, a city of about 5,000 south of St. Louis, houses an estimated 60-85 ICE detainees on any given day, said Johnson, whose organization supports immigration detainees in the jail as well as area immigrant families. A military presence isn’t necessary, she said.
“I think that this is probably just a little more of a political game to say, ‘Well, we need to bring in, basically, the military to help control this,’” Johnson said.

This year, Trump is president, and Sununu is exploring another run for U.S. Senate. And he is shrugging off the importance of Trump.
“Look, this is going to be about New Hampshire,” he said in an interview with WMUR Wednesday confirming that exploration. “New Hampshire voters, New Hampshire values. Putting together a strong campaign.”
Sununu has personal experience with the Senate seat; he defeated current-Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in 2002 and held the seat for one term before Shaheen ousted him in 2008. Shaheen has kept the seat since; Sununu has worked as a board member and policy adviser for banks and lobbying firms in the meantime.
But as Sununu contemplates an entry into the race, Trump’s potential influence looms large — and two of Sununu’s would-be primary rivals are actively vying for the president’s support. 
Trump has not made an endorsement, which lands in an election year where Republicans hold a bare majority and are looking for any opportunity to flip a Democrat-held seat and expand control. 
Competing for Trump’s eye
Republican candidate Scott Brown, the former Massachusetts senator, has sought to align himself with Trump’s agenda this year, praising Trump for policies on border enforcement and trade.
That bond has some history: In Trump’s first term, the president appointed Brown as ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa.
But Brown also sharply criticized Trump in May 2021 for his actions leading up to the Jan. 6 insurrection, saying that Trump “absolutely” bears responsibility for the riots and that “his presidency was diminished” because of them. 
State Sen. Dan Innis, another candidate in the race, has centered his campaign around the contention he is the most pro-Trump person in the running. 
On Wednesday, he reiterated that contention.
“Let’s be honest, there are bad eggs in this race,” Innis said in a statement Wednesday afternoon touting a recent drop in egg prices. “I’m the only pro-Trump conservative in this race, and I’ll never back down.”
Representatives for Brown and Innis did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday about the possibility of Sununu entering the race. 
The candidates are seeking the Republican nomination for the Senate seat currently held by Shaheen, who is not running for reelection. U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas and Karishma Manzur are both competing for the Democratic nomination.
In a statement Wednesday, Pappas called Sununu a “corporate sellout” and charged Republicans with starting a “scramble to find Donald Trump’s perfect candidate.”
State Republicans see game-changer
While his potential rivals are positioning themselves for a Trump endorsement, Sununu did not appear to be in a hurry Wednesday. He told WMUR he would be conducting listening sessions around the state to gauge support for his potential candidacy. And he said he hopes to receive endorsements from a broad array of people, not just Trump. 
To some state Republicans, Sununu could be a formidable challenger in the race, even with his comments about Trump.
Responding to Sununu’s announcement, House Majority Leader Jason Osborne posted on X: “This would change the whole game.” Matt Mowers, a Republican who unsuccessfully challenged Pappas in 2020 and 2022, also called a possible Sununu entry a “game changer,” writing that “John Sununu puts the race on the map and starts as immediate front runner.”
Lou Gargiulo, a former Republican state representative, is a longtime supporter of Trump, serving as a state co-chair of the Trump campaign in 2016 and 2020.
But Gargiulo has been an advocate for John E. Sununu for even longer, supporting his campaigns in 2002 and 2008. And on Wednesday, he argued that Sununu’s past opposition to Trump would not necessarily limit his prospects.
“He’s a fiscal conservative, I think he’s socially conservative, I think he’s good on the Second Amendment, I think he’s good on taxation — I think … that the base would be happy to see a guy like him in the race,” he said in an interview. 
Gargiulo has not made up his mind on the GOP primary, he said. 
But the most important factor for Sununu, Gargiulo argues, is not Trump, but Sununu’s viability as a candidate and ability to raise money. Against the financial advantages held by Pappas, that will matter most, he said. 
Still, Sununu’s Trump positions could create some headaches, Gargiulo conceded. His advice: Sununu should reach out to the president and make his case. 
Trump could also choose to be pragmatic, he added.
“It depends on who talks to the president about him,” Gargiulo said. “I think at this point, we want to pick up some Senate seats. And if he could deliver a Senate seat, then I think the president will be somewhat forgiving.”
A family history
Kathy Sullivan, who served as New Hampshire Democratic Party chairwoman during Sununu’s campaign for Senate in 2002, also doubts that Sununu’s anti-Trump positions will hold him back, at least not if he is seen as a front-runner. If that happens, his past statements won’t matter, she argued.
“As long as John E. Sununu is a member of the Republican Party, he’s a Trumpist,” Sullivan said. 
Even if Sununu avoids talking about Trump, Sullivan argued he will run the risk of either being seen as not loyal enough by Trump’s base or lumped in with the president by independent voters. 
“I don’t think he can hide from Trump,” she said. “He may say a thing here and a thing there to try to separate himself from Trump, but that’s not going to be much and it’s not going to help him.”
To Dante Scala, professor of political science and international affairs at the University of New Hampshire, John E. Sununu’s predicament with Trump is a familiar one for his family. As governor, Chris Sununu perfected the art of accepting Trump while leaving room for sporadic moments of disagreement.
“The Sununus never seemed content with that, with toeing the line,” he said. “Even when they bent the knee to Trump, they never wanted to come off as such, as just kind of Trump clones.”
But John E. Sununu is running for U.S. Senate, a body much more tied to the politics of the White House than the governor’s office, Scala noted. That affords him less cover to pledge neutrality or avoid conflict, he said.
It means Sununu will need to proactively define himself and his vision for Republican politics, Scala said — especially because his term, should he win, would extend beyond Trump’s final year in office.
“Chris Sununu really wanted to move his party beyond Donald Trump. He failed, but he did have that ambition. He probably still does,” Scala said. 
“I wonder what kind of ambition John Sununu has, in terms of the direction of his party?”
On Wednesday, speaking to WMUR, Sununu said the state needed someone who had its values, “that’s not going to vote a party line, that’s willing to take risks and get things done.”
As for Trump?
“I would want to win support, if I were to run, across the entire spectrum, and obviously that includes the president,” he said. “We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/johnesununu-1024x672.jpg,,,2025-09-04 05:57:31.445554

The Boston Globe reported recently that a small group of neo-Nazis gathered outside the New Hampshire State House in Concord.

The Boston Globe reported recently that a small group of neo-Nazis gathered outside the New Hampshire State House in Concord. Wearing facemasks, they held a banner proclaiming “Trump loves Epstein.” Were they saying this was a good thing? Or were they protesting? What about Nazis’ historical hatred of Jews? Who knows? It was impossible to read their expressions, because they all wore masks.
A posted scholarly lecture on the Virginia Museum of History and Culture’s website tells us that early KKK members wore burlap feed sacks over the faces, donned animal horns and wore white muslin masks to indicate they were “non-human,” including corpses come back to life. Who were these members of the nation’s first domestic terrorism group? The neighbors of the people they hunted? How did they feel about what they were doing? Who knows? It was impossible to read their expressions, because they all wore masks.
Today, all across the country, masked men, claiming to be representatives of the U.S. government, are snatching people off the streets, out of courtrooms, off high school ballfields, and from the lines of workers in car washes. Are they employed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement? Are they self-appointed vigilantes? Are they sex traffickers acting under cover to kidnap people for sex slavery? Who knows? It is impossible to read their expressions, because they all wear masks.
Hiding one’s face is, of course, an ancient practice. Humans have always worn masks — in war and sports, in religious ritual, during celebrations, and on stage. Shakespeare’s lovers donned them at masquerade balls. Bad guys like Darth Vader and Jason Voorhees wear masks. But so do good guys like Batman, Spiderman and Zorro. Complex anti-heroes like the Phantom of the Opera maintain their mystery behind a mask. And of course children love the strange, freeing anonymity a mask gives them at Hallowe’en.
Most of us — those who respect science and were concerned for others’ safety — wore masks for three long years during the Covid pandemic. And we were thrilled to toss them once the vaccine allowed life to return to normal. Some folks with compromised immune systems choose to wear them still, especially in crowds.
But now? For those of us not still at grave risk, or on a sport team, in a religious group or on stage, the main reason to cover one’s face is to hide our shame. Our hands instinctively fly up to our cheeks and cover our nose and mouth when we are caught doing something wrong, or embarrassing.
So a simple question for ICE agents (both real and impostors), for neo-Nazis, and for today’s white supremacists posting hateful literature on lampposts in small towns across the nation, is this: if you’re too ashamed to show your face, why are you doing what you’re doing?










For those of us not still at grave risk, or on a sport team, in a religious group or on stage, the main reason to cover one’s face is to hide our shame. 


People in public office (as I once was) are often stalked, harassed and ridiculed on social media. Sometimes, as in the tragic case of the state representative in Minnesota, they are murdered. The public expects elected officials to show their faces, literally and figuratively. It’s called accountability. And yes, often it puts a target on our back, as it has recently with Rep. Corey Paris, who is being sent the most racist, vile and dangerous threats from across the country for calling out ICE in his district. Still, I don’t know any elected person hiding behind a mask, unless you consider Trump’s orange make-up a bizarre version of kumadori, the stylized makeup worn in Japanese Kabuki theater.
In 2016, at a protest march I attended after Trump was first elected, I engaged a young man who seemed to be in his mid-20s. He wore a Trump tee-shirt and was heckling us from the sidelines. I asked why he was covering his face with a mask. He said something that cannot be reprinted here — something inspired by Trump’s boasting about what he does to women’s bodies. He spat out he would do that to me if I didn’t move on.
So I asked him what his mother would think of that. Yes, I admit, a prissy, perhaps uptight thing to do, but still. I wanted him to explain his thought process. After all, aren’t we liberals supposed to engage with these folks? To get to know their minds? Not to judge but, rather, to “meet them where they are?”
So instead of returning this threat with something similar about his private parts (which, as everyone knows, are a lot more fragile than a woman’s), I asked again: Does your mother know you’re doing this? He emitted a sort of grunt. I could not read his expression, because he wore a mask. But he did drop his shoulders a little, and bowed his head just a bit. The parade of marchers moved on.
I think of that young man often — he’s probably around 30 now. Plenty old enough to be a father to a child who may get measles. Perhaps his mother now has cancer and needs to enter a clinical trial that’s been defunded. Perhaps the tariffs have cost him his job. I wonder if the mask will fall from his face when the scales fall from his eyes.

SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXCongressional redistricting plans will be introduced in the legislature, where they will be assigned a bill number like any other piece of legislation, and then will be subject to hearings before a committee in both chambers. After committee approval, both chambers will vote on the measure.
In order for the map to last 10 years, it has to receive 66% approval in each chamber, including approval from at least half the Democrats and half the Republicans in the Senate and House, according to the Ohio Constitution.
If agreement can’t be reached in the legislature by Sept. 30, the process moves to the Ohio Redistricting Commission, which would have until the end of October to come up with a bipartisan plan.
Without agreement there, the process heads back to the legislature, where a plan can be passed with a simple majority. The constitution gives a deadline of Nov. 30 for the legislature’s second attempt.
With a simple majority adoption, however, the constitution dictates that the plan would only be valid for four years.
The redistricting process is back in Ohio after previous attempts at congressional map-drawing didn’t produce bipartisan maps. Both congressional maps that were adopted in Ohio were struck down as unconstitutionally partisan by the Ohio Supreme Court.
Despite being unconstitutional, the most recently approved congressional map was used for the last general election.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)As a proud Claremont public schools alumnus, it’s been devastating to watch my hometown’s school district suffer with a more than $5 million deficit and cut more than 39 positions from its local schools. Tech Center supplies, extracurricular activities, and school programs relied on emergency fundraising days before the start of the school year, and there’s no guarantee of schools staying open even past March.
The district administration deserves scrutiny for how we got here, and the school board is stuck between a rock and a hard place. At the most recent board meeting, one member put it plainly: “We’re out of options.” But that raises the larger question: Where is the state government?
This crisis didn’t appear out of thin air. Our school budgets in New Hampshire are overwhelmingly dependent on local property taxes. When a city like Claremont already has one of the highest property tax rates in the state and a large population simply struggling to get by paycheck to paycheck, there is no room for error. Almost 30 years ago, the Claremont lawsuits established that New Hampshire has a constitutional duty to provide every child with an adequate education. That duty cannot be met by pushing the burden onto struggling communities alone.
More recently, in Contoocook Valley School District v. State, the New Hampshire Supreme Court reaffirmed that responsibility, finding the state’s per-pupil funding levels unconstitutional. The decision was clear: The state is not meeting its obligation. Yet Claremont today shows the worst of both worlds: a district that has mismanaged its finances and a state that has failed to step in when children’s education is on the chopping block.
As a Claremont resident and taxpayer, I agree with Gov. Kelly Ayotte that Claremont’s current financial situation is unacceptable. But acknowledgment is not enough. The governor’s office and the Department of Education cannot wash their hands of responsibility when the state’s own highest court has ruled the current system unconstitutional. They cannot point fingers and walk away while almost 2,000 students, kids who had no say in the decisions that created this mess, are forced to wonder whether their schools will be fully staffed, their classes offered, or their after-school activities canceled.
Let’s be clear: This crisis is primarily the fault of Claremont’s district administration. Families, teachers, and taxpayers deserve answers for how the budget was allowed to collapse so severely over the past five years. Accountability must be demanded at the local level. But state leaders do not get to stand idly by while one of New Hampshire’s city educational systems teeters on the brink.
At the end of the day, schools are not line items but places where the future of New Hampshire is being shaped every day. Teachers should be able to focus on educating, not wondering if their jobs will vanish by spring. Students should not have to scramble to save their sports teams through bake sales, and parents should not be forced to make a last-minute decision about whether to move their kids to another school district.
Claremont has made mistakes. That much is obvious. However, the children of Claremont should not bear the consequences of the failures of adults in positions of power, whether in the district office or the State House. Gov. Ayotte and Education Commissioner Caitlin Davis should exhaust every policy option possible, including even financial assistance through the current school year, to ensure that the students in the Claremont School District have the same shot at opportunity as every other child in New Hampshire.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/domeandbell-1024x657.jpg,,,2025-09-04 04:56:10.115772

(Photo by Megan Henry, Ohio Capital Journal.)LifeWise Academy, a controversial Hilliard-based religious instruction program, will be in almost half of Ohio’s public school districts this school year. 
The academy will now be in 613 Ohio schools in 303 school districts for the 2025-26 school year, said Christine Czernejewski, a spokesperson for LifeWise. 
Back in January, LifeWise was in about 160 Ohio school districts — a nearly 90% increase since the start of the calendar year.
The academy’s new count comes after a new law took effect in April that requires Ohio school districts to have a religious-release time policy. The previous law merely permitted a policy. 
“While the recent clarification in Ohio law has helped reinforce districts’ ability to offer release-time religious instruction, the growth is primarily driven by increased demand from families across the state,” Czernejewski said. “Communities have been proactively bringing LifeWise to their local schools because they understand the positive impact of Bible education during school hours.”
LifeWise operates in 34 states and plans to enroll nearly 100,000 students this year, according to its website. 
“Demand for LifeWise is surging, and we couldn’t be more excited to see families taking advantage of our programming, from urban areas to remote towns,” said CEO Joel Penton.  
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe non-denominational Christian program teaches the Bible to public school students during the school day, and started in Ohio in 2019. The courses usually take place during lunch or during elective courses.
But LifeWise has many critics and parents have said their students have been ostracized and bullied for not taking part in LifeWise.  
“These kids are affected when they don’t go,” said Zachary Parrish, a parent who had LifeWise file a lawsuit against him for copyright infringement. “They feel left out. They don’t understand why their parents aren’t letting them go.” 
Parrish now lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, but his daughter was a second-grader in Defiance City Schools in 2021 and he is not surprised Ohio has seen such an uptick in districts offering the religious classes.  
“They’ve been in Ohio the longest,” he said. “They’ve got the most connections in Ohio. It’s where the organization is from. It’s where all the leadership is from. So it doesn’t surprise me that Ohio is the hotbed for it.”
Religious instruction under the law
The United States Supreme Court upheld release time laws during the 1952 Zorach v. Clauson case, which allowed a school district to have students leave school for part of the day to receive religious instruction.
Religious release time instruction must meet three criteria: the courses must take place off school property, be privately funded and students must have parental permission.
Tina Sobo, a rabbi at Temple Israel Dayton and mom of two students in Miamisburg Schools, said students in her congregation have heard antisemitic comments from their classmates when they return from LifeWise. 
“The curriculum teaches that because my kids are Jewish and don’t believe in Jesus, we’re going to hell … And touching on just some of the low-level antisemitism, just really more ignorant type comments,” she said. “It’s a very specific version of Christianity that, I think, goes against, in my opinion, goals of creating an inclusive, positive religious environment in America.”
LifeWise, which started in Miamisburg in January, “unequivocally condemns antisemitism or any form of harassment or discrimination,” Czernejewski said. 
“Our mission is to provide Bible-based character education,” she said. “If any student were to make inappropriate or hurtful remarks toward their peers, whether inside or outside of school, that behavior would be inconsistent with what LifeWise teaches.”
Rachel Evans, a mom of a student in Centerville City Schools, does not want to send her son to LifeWise because their family is Jewish. LifeWise is launching in Centerville this month. 
“You have these kids who are taught that they need to save people because they’re taught that hell is just the worst place you could go,” she said. “And they’re really trying to help their friends, but that can be really damaging to a kid.” 
Hearing LifeWise is in almost half of Ohio’s school districts makes Evans scared for her son’s future. 
“I have had past experiences where I was proselytized to at a very young age and it’s not a good feeling,” she said. “… The whole point of it is to disrupt the school day. … There are so many other times when this would be appropriate, and I think during the school day is not it.”

(Courtesy of Kleban for Maine)Another Democrat, co-founder of Maine Beer Company Dan Kleban, has entered the race to try to unseat longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins in 2026.
Announcing his candidacy on Wednesday, the 48-year-old Cumberland County resident said he’s running because he feels a responsibility to do what’s right for Maine, like when he started his company with his wife and brother after being laid off from a law firm during the Great Recession.
“Executives at the big banks who crashed our economy walked away without facing any consequences. I was pissed,” Kleban said in a statement. “So my brother and I started Maine Beer Company not only to make good beer, but to live by our Do What’s Right motto that crooks on Wall Street never understood.” In practice, that motto means providing fully paid health care and donating 1% of all annual sales to environmental nonprofits, he added.
Now, Kleban said the same thing is happening in Congress, specifically calling out Collins, whose actions he sees hardworking Mainers paying the price for as they struggle to afford housing, health care, groceries, and electric bills.
Maine’s Senate race heated up last month when Graham Platner, a largely unknown oysterman and military veteran, entered the race at the encouragement of unions. Platner’s campaign raised $1 million in the first nine days and he was endorsed by independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at a Labor Day rally attended by more than 6,500 in Portland.
Kleban’s launch video and website make some similar appeals as Platner. Kleban emphasizes his working-class roots and student debt, living many of the affordability challenges he believes other Mainers want their elected officials to fix.
Most of the people vying for Collins’ seat are political newcomers, Platner and Kleban included. One Democratic candidate, Jordan Wood, is a former congressional aide who has spent about a decade working in politics in Washington, D.C.
Establishment Democrats have been trying to convince Maine Gov. Janet Mills to run. She’s still unsure but said she’d likely decide by mid-November.
As for a primary challenge, Maine Republicans have rejected the idea, though President Donald Trump has said behind closed doors that he’d welcome a “better option.” He’s also recently revoked the otherwise unusual public deference he’d shown Collins.
Kleban spoke about the president being a threat to the values of Mainers in his launch video and said Collins “refuses to stand up to Donald Trump when it really matters.”
Kleban also criticized Collins’ 2018 vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, the majority of which then stripped nationwide abortion protections when overturning Roe v. Wade.

(Getty Images)Magistrate Judge Ron Sylvester’s story about the need to eliminate cash bonds in nonviolent cases begins with two QuikTrip hot dogs, one actual dog, and a man with mental health and addiction issues struggling to survive.
Setting bonds, said Sylvester, who retired in April after five years on the bench, doesn’t protect communities. It can, however, mock justice as it did for a then-74-year-old Thomas Wimberly, who spent 71 days in jail for stealing hot dogs he gave to his dog, Smokey Bear.
Retired Magistrate Judge Ron Sylvester (Kansas Judicial Branch)
Bail bonds, in Sylvester’s estimation, are regressive, exploitative legal system versions of payday loans that prey on people like Wimberly. Sylvester, a journalist for 40 years who covered courts for the Wichita Eagle, shared a story he’d written almost 20 years ago.
It was early July in 2006 when Wimberly put Smokey Bear into a shopping cart and headed to a downtown Wichita car show. On the way home, he stopped at a QuikTrip and grabbed two hot dogs for the hungry Smokey Bear.
But as Wimberly prepared the last hot dog, he saw Smokey Bear climbing out of the cart and left the store without paying. A moonlighting police officer saw Wimberly leave without paying the $2.11 he owed.
By the time the officer reached Wimberly, Smokey Bear had gulped the hot dogs.
Wimberly was booked on theft but his case was dismissed.
Sylvester said Wimberly thought it was over. Not close.
Wimberly had two previous misdemeanor thefts on his record — one more than a decade old. This third misdemeanor became a felony under Kansas law. The city sent the case to the district attorney’s office.
The summons the D.A.’s office sent to attend a hearing came back undelivered. So, when Wimberly didn’t show, a judge issued a bench warrant that sent Wimberly to jail on what for him was a whopping $5,000 bond.
Sylvester said bail bond services typically post a bond for 10% of the amount, but $500 exceeded what Wimberly drew in a month from Social Security. At the time of his arrest, Wimberly lived on $448 a month.
Jurors took two days off work when the case went to trial. They heard the evidence and found Wimberly not guilty. Sylvester said some jurors were irate the case went to trial.
“It was stupid,” presiding juror Krysti Mason, 21, said of Wimbley’s trial in the Eagle article
With the national conversation now about cracking down on crime, it isn’t wrong to wonder where this narrative that the nation is soft on crime comes from. Our nation has 5% of the world’s population but 25% of its criminals. We are tough on crime.
It’s time we got smart on crime. At roughly $50 a day for 71 days, the system spent a minimum of $3,550 on Wimberly’s $2.11 hot dog heist.
Sylvester said Wimberly, who also suffered from mental health issues, got Smokey Bear back and that Wimberly often carried the newspaper story with him, basking in his 15 minutes of fame.
Wimberly has since died, but his story and the cruel system of bail bonds live on.
The bonds are unnecessary, Sylvester said of most nonviolent cases. Text messages have proven sufficient to get people to return to court. The bond industry, he said, preys on fear, claiming bond-less defendants would be dangers to the community.
“Yeah, with them on the mean streets of Kingman, we aren’t safe,” he said sarcastically of the south-central Kansas town where he served as a magistrate. “All (the current system) does is allow rich, dangerous people to roam the community.”
Sylvester often offered defendants “OR bonds,” or own recognizance bonds. Defendants paid only if they didn’t show up for court dates. Besides, most of the people who appeared in front of him needed help, not punishment.
“About 90 to 95% of the cases I heard had a mental health or addiction component or both,” he said. “A lot of this has to do with the failure to pass Medicaid.”
He appeared in a Wall Street Journal article about Pratt Regional Medical Center suing many of its patients because it was the only way to generate the revenue necessary to keep the hospital open.
The Journal featured Sylvester in a story last year about how 95% of the civil cases he was hearing were brought by the hospital. In July and August 2023, four of every five sheriff-delivered court summonses in Pratt County were from the hospital.
“By December,” the story said, “it had sued some 400 people in a county of 9,000 — more than it had in the past five years combined.”
Sylvester said people who appeared in front of him pleaded for help.
“I’ve told anyone who would listen that if you want to be tough on crime, you should work to properly fund community mental health and addiction treatments in every Kansas town. You do that, and you will significantly cut crime, especially in rural areas.”
And maybe not spend thousands of dollars on bonds and hot dog larceny.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)More police agencies, from big-city departments to federal agencies, are lowering education standards for new recruits — a sign of how much the profession is changing as it struggles to recruit and retain officers.
This year, at least two major city agencies — the New York Police Department and the Dallas Police Department — have cut some education requirements for new recruits.
In February, the NYPD reduced its college credit requirement for police academy entry from 60 credits to 24. Following a new policy approval in June, the Dallas Police Department began allowing applicants with only a high school diploma or GED to qualify if they also have three consecutive years of full-time work experience.
Police agencies nationwide are loosening education requirements in an effort to address years of staffing shortages. The changes also come as President Donald Trump has drawn more attention to crime and public safety by deploying the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, and signaling plans to expand federal enforcement efforts in Chicago and other cities. (A federal judge on Tuesday ruled Trump’s mobilization of U.S. Marines and the California National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles this summer violated federal law.) Trump also has taken over the District of Columbia’s police department.
Reports of violent crime nationwide have been decreasing since 2022. Some communities, though, are still facing higher rates of certain crimes, including homicide.
The changes in New York City and Dallas are part of a yearslong trend of police departments easing college requirements, a shift that includes Boise, Idaho; Chicago; Louisville, Kentucky; New Orleans; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Memphis, Tennessee; and Bellingham, Washington. Even some state police agencies, such as the Kentucky State Police and the Pennsylvania State Police, have followed suit.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXBut these changes in education requirements aren’t limited to local and state forces. The FBI — which for decades required a four-year degree — will no longer mandate one for new recruits starting in October. New recruits also will receive just eight weeks of training, down from the previous 18-week standard, according to The New York Times.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also has loosened standards as the Trump administration seeks to expand immigration enforcement. The agency removed its five-week Spanish-language training requirement. Translation needs would instead be met through unspecified technology, The Intercept reported.
ICE has paired these changes with aggressive incentives, including signing bonuses of up to $50,000, as much as $60,000 in student loan repayment and retirement benefits.
These changes reflect a broader challenge in policing: Agencies are still struggling to recruit and retain officers amid increased public attention and shifting workforce expectations.
“The demand exceeds the supply, and what’s happened is the environment for being a police officer has changed,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a national nonprofit think tank on policing standards. “The expectations have never been higher.”
Resignations and retirements rose sharply after 2020, when nationwide protests put law enforcement under closer public scrutiny following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. Additionally, some officers are leaving big-city departments for smaller agencies. At the same time, some experts say, police agencies are competing in a tight labor market in which shift jobs may be less appealing than positions with regular hours, higher pay or remote work options.
In recent years, the push for better-educated officers has been rooted in research suggesting that college graduates are less likely to use force and perform better on the job. But some say that strict education mandates can shrink the applicant pool and shouldn’t be the sole measure of what makes a good officer.
“College education, in the greater scheme of things, is advantageous. It’s necessary, but not sufficient,” Wexler said, noting that agencies should also weigh a recruit’s work history, maturity, judgement and other characteristics.
Agencies of all sizes also have adjusted other standards to attract more applicants — raising or lowering minimum age limits, loosening tattoo policies, scaling back fitness tests and waiving exam fees.
In some departments, these changes have sparked a surge in applications, but they haven’t always translated into higher staffing levels overall.
Following the NYPD’s announcement in February that it was changing its education requirement, daily applications jumped from an average of 53 to 231, according to a news release. In early August, the agency swore in 1,093 recruits — its largest incoming class since January 2016.
The New Orleans Police Department nixed its college education requirement in 2015 and saw a surge of 7,440 applications just two years later.
But hiring never kept pace: The department brought on about 100 recruits a year, and far fewer after 2020, according to the city’s hiring dashboard. In 2024, the department received 1,575 applications and hired just 35 recruits.
A report from the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s office released late last year found that between 2019 and 2023, the department lost nearly 27% of its policing staff.
 Solving the staffing crisis

Staffing shortfalls have been a long-standing challenge for law enforcement agencies, stretching back well before 2020. But in recent years, hiring has improved in some parts of the country.
The latest Police Executive Research Forum survey, based on responses from 217 agencies across 39 states and the District of Columbia, suggests staffing trends are uneven.
As of Jan. 1, sworn staffing was up slightly from the year before but still 5.2% below 2020 levels, according to the survey. Large departments saw modest growth in 2024 but still employ 6% fewer officers than in 2020, while medium and small agencies have not just recovered but now surpass 2020 levels.
“This period we’re in now, and we have been in for the last few years, is the most challenging time to hire a police officer,” Wexler said.
In recent years, state legislatures also have looked into the education requirements for police. In 2023, for example, Oregon lawmakers considered a bill that would have required at least two years of higher education for departments with fewer than 50 officers and a bachelor’s degree for departments with more than 50. It would have applied to police, corrections, parole, probation and reserve officers, but the bill stalled in a Senate committee.
More recently, lawmakers in California are considering a bill that would, starting in 2031, require incoming officers to obtain a policing certificate, associate degree or bachelor’s degree within 36 months of graduating from a police academy. Incoming officers could also meet the requirement through prior military service or out-of-state law enforcement experience.
The proposal has received widespread support from many law enforcement agencies and groups in the state, including the California Police Chiefs Association, California State Sheriffs’ Association and the Peace Officers Research Association of California.
The sheriffs’ association praised the legislation, writing in a statement that it offers a range of acceptable experiences — “enhancing academic rigor” — without burdensome requirements that could hurt agencies’ recruiting goals.
Police education requirements are often set by individual departments or local jurisdictions, rather than written into state law. Across the country, most local law enforcement agencies require only a high school diploma or GED, though officers with a college degree may have more opportunities for promotions and higher pay.
“Educational standards across law enforcement agencies vary considerably,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University.
Some agencies also have created pathways for new officers to earn college credit through completing the police academy program and offer tuition reimbursement for those who want to pursue advanced degrees.
But La Vigne told Stateline that in-service training, organizational structure, leadership and accountability mechanisms within a department also play a key role in shaping a well-rounded officer.
“Those factors, I think, override anything as simple as ‘We’re requiring or removing education as a threshold for employment,’” La Vigne said. “Educational requirements alone are not the biggest factor.”
 What makes a good cop

What makes a good police officer has long been debated, with discussions often centering on the role of education, training and personal qualities.













Having a college education by itself doesn’t mean you will be a better police officer.


– Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Research Executive Forum





Some argue that, rather than lowering education requirements, departments should improve people’s perceptions of the police by becoming more involved in the community, especially at a time when heightened scrutiny has made the job less appealing to some.
“It’s trying to fix the problem assuming that the way things work now is the way things are supposed to be,” said Jim Nolan, a sociology professor at West Virginia University and a speaker with the nonprofit Law Enforcement Action Partnership. Nolan previously served as a police officer and as an FBI unit chief. “It’s the approach to policing that’s wrong.”
Some research suggests that college-educated officers use force less often, face fewer complaints and are disciplined less frequently than their peers without a degree. Some policing experts say a college education may give officers a broader perspective on a range of issues while also strengthening critical thinking and teamwork skills.
Research also suggests that college-educated officers are stronger writers, which can lead to clearer investigations and casework, according to a 2017 report on higher education in policing.
But some experts still caution that the research is not conclusive and argue that education alone isn’t enough to determine what makes a good police officer.
“Having a college education by itself doesn’t mean you will be a better police officer,” said Wexler, of the Police Executive Research Forum.

I’m a retiree member of the American Federation of Teachers who taught history at West Kentucky Community and Technical College in Paducah for two dozen years.
The Knights are gone and largely forgotten. Yet they were 19th century America’s largest labor organization and an ancestor of the AFL-CIO.
Founded in 1869 in Philadelphia, the Knights “tried to teach the American wage-earner that he was a wage-earner first and a bricklayer, carpenter, miner, shoemaker, after; that he was a wage-earner first and a Catholic, Protestant, Jew, white, black, Democrat, Republican, after,” historian Norman J. Ware wrote in “The Labor Movement in the United States 1860-1895: A Study in Democracy.” I’d add “teacher” to the list of jobs.
“The Knights operated as both a trade union federation and a political movement,” wrote historian Jonathan Garlock. “Envisioning a ‘Cooperative Commonwealth’ in which producer cooperatives and nationalized railroads would replace monopolistic capitalism, the Knights launched dozens of local and state labor parties and hundreds of worker-owned cooperatives.”
Knights belonged to Local Assemblies which numbered in the thousands. Each assembly “represented members in their work places, bargaining with employers, threatening and conducting strikes,” Garlock added. “Inclusivity was the other hallmark of the KOL (especially in comparison to the American Federation of Labor unions that followed). The Knights included African American workers and counted 246 local assemblies organized by women workers.”
The main goal of the Knights and other 19th century unions was the eight-hour workday. They also called for the abolition of child labor. But the Knights argued that men and women who did the same job should get the same pay.
The Knights’ motto was, “That is the most perfect government in which an injury to one is the concern of all.” The union peaked at almost a million members in the late 1880s, before fading away and all but disappearing by the turn of the 20th century.
The union spread nationwide, and even worldwide, with Local Assemblies in Canada, Great Britain and Australia. According to The Kentucky Encyclopedia, 177 assemblies operated in Kentucky — in Louisville, Covington Lexington, Frankfort and even in small towns like Fulton. I treasure a copy of The Toiler, the Fulton Knights’ newspaper.
On Nov. 25, 1894, Lexington area Knights celebrated their union’s 25th birthday at the Opera House, enjoying “a gratifying success in every feature,” according to the Kentucky Leader of Nov. 26. (A ball followed at Jackson Hall with Saxton’s Band providing the dance music.)
Success was often elusive for unions as the country rapidly industrialized after the Civil War. Well-heeled capitalists helped whip up anti-labor hysteria by demonizing unions as “un-Christian” and “un-American,” even communist.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXMost employers, notably in industry, stubbornly, even violently, resisted unions, with help from friendly local and state officials. Judges routinely issued injunctions to stop strikes. Police, sheriff’s deputies and even National Guard troops were almost always available for strikebreaking duty.
Union-busting was bipartisan. Republican President Rutherford B. Hayes dispatched federal troops to break the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. President Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, sent U.S. soldiers to crush the Pullman Strike in 1894.
To protect its members against getting fired by anti-union bosses, the Knights had started as a secret organization. The Knights dropped its veil of secrecy in 1879 and deleted “Noble and Holy Order” from its original name.
Afterwards, the union enjoyed rapid growth.
Featured speakers at the 25th birthday celebration included local Democratic Congressman W.C.P. Breckinridge, a Confederate veteran, and Dr. W.T. Bolling, a Lexington pastor.
Breckinridge acknowledged that the federal government had the power to abolish child labor, outlaw the company store system and pass laws to make workplaces sanitary. But he rebuked those who looked to federal “legislation as the great panacea or cure all of the nineteenth century,” the Lexington paper said.
Bolling advised workers that if they would “be true, be patient, honest and diligent” and vote “the time will come when the host of labor may sing as sung Israel when freed from the bondage of Egypt.”
The Leader didn’t report the Knights’ reaction to the politician or the pastor. But based on the preamble to the union’s 1878 “Declaration of Principles” they might have been disappointed. The preamble warned that “the alarming development and aggressiveness of great capitalists and corporations, unless checked, will invariably lead to the pauperization and hopeless degradation of the toiling masses.”
Thus, it was “imperative, if we desire to enjoy the full blessings of life, that a check be placed upon unjust accumulation, and the power for evil of aggregated wealth. This much-desired object can be accomplished only by the united efforts of those who obey the divine injunction, ‘In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread.’”
A footnote: Not everybody was welcome to join the Knights, explained a Nov. 25 Leader story about the upcoming anniversary observance. The banned list included “stock-holders, bankers, lawyers, professional gamblers, and those who, in any way, derive their living from the manufacture or sale of intoxicating liquors.”

(Photo via Florida Division of Emergency Management X account)Hello, is this the Florida Department of Governmental Efficiency, aka FLO-DOGE? I’ve got a hot tip for you on an incredibly wasteful government project. It’s called “Alligator Alcatraz.”
I know DOGE has been hounding city and county officials — especially the ones who have ticked off developers — looking for wasted taxpayer money. You really should look into this one. It’s HUUUUUGE.
Gov. Ron DeSantis decided to blow millions in taxpayer money on a tent-and-fence camp in the middle of a major nature preserve. Believe it or not, he did it without doing one single thing to check its impact on our endangered panthers, our clean water, or our recovering Everglades.
Instead, he just rushed to build it as fast as possible, spending $218 million. He had to truck in everything the staff and inmates needed, from portable toilets that repeatedly overflowed to blinding lights that ruined one of the few dark-sky places left in our state.
Some of the contractors he hired to build and run the place were, in a word, shady. Five of them “have links to allegations of improper business practices and misuse of public funds,” the Miami Herald reported recently.
Blaise Ingoglia via CFO office
This is the kind of willful wastefulness that used to drive DOGE’s boss, new CFO Blaise Ingoglia, howling mad back when was the “Government Gone Wild” guy.
To no one’s surprise, this slapdash structure faced a serious legal challenge from Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe, which lives nearby. After hearing extensive testimony — including from a scientist who said that 800,000 square feet of new paving had been put in at the soggy site — a federal judge ruled for the environmental groups and Native Americans.
The judge found that federal law required an environmental assessment before construction began, but the evidence showed the people who built this thing “did not engage with a single step of the environmental review process.”
I hear the guv whined about an “activist judge” expecting him to follow the law. Poor baby!
The judge ordered Ronnie’s Folly shut down in 60 days, at an estimated cost of another $15 to $20 million in taxpayer money. Two months after it opened, the whole place is being dismantled and everyone transferred elsewhere. It just boggles the mind.
Imagine what we could have done with that money instead of this short-lived mess that put a premium on skeevy marketing over environmental and economic stewardship.
Better than burning it
What should I call you — just Mr. DOGE? You’ll find this fascinating, Mr. DOGE.
Poking around in the wreckage of Ronnie’s Folly, investigative journalist Jason Garcia found records showing how badly the taxpayers were ripped off.
“Altogether, updated procurement records show that Florida has awarded more than $350 million in contracts and purchase orders connected with the Everglades camp, which contractors raced to build in just eight days,” Garcia wrote in his “Seeking Rents” Substack.
He added that DeSantis & Co. “actually would have done a lot less harm … if they had simply set the cash on fire.”
That’s one option, I suppose. But let’s be more imaginative and consider what we could have spent that money on instead of this dismal dog’s breakfast.
Take environmental land acquisition, for instance.
Eve Samples via Friends of the Everglades
Clay Henderson via subject
I asked Eve Samples of the Friends of the Everglades what she would have spent the money on. Her answer: Buying up as much of the Everglades Agricultural Area as possible and converting it back into the River of Grass. She even pointed me toward a petition that her organization is circulating to push Florida officials to take that step.
Former Florida Audubon president Clay Henderson, suggested an even broader effort.
In 2022 the Legislature approved spending $100 million in recurring revenue for the Florida Forever land-buying fund. But this year, despite the obvious signs that Florida’s voters cherish our parks and preserves, our legislators ignored that promise and only funded $18 million.
They also voted to repeal a law that created a big source of funding for buying even more environmentally sensitive land. It’s a law they had passed unanimously and with great fanfare just a year before: the Seminole Gaming Compact. Now that gambling money will go into general revenue instead.
There went another $100 million for the Florida environment that everyone thought was guaranteed.
“Florida’s growth rate now results in the loss of 100,000 acres a year to development,” said Henderson, author of a terrific history of Florida environmental land preservation called “Forces of Nature.” “Providing $300 million for Florida Forever would allow us to protect as many acres as will be destroyed.”
Oil and water
Mr. DOGE, I consulted a bunch of other folks about better things to spend these millions on. I told people I was especially interested in anything that would have improved the Big Cypress National Preserve instead of polluting it.
Matthew Schwartz, executive director of the South Florida Wildlands Association, via subject
One of the best suggestions came from Matthew Schwartz of the South Florida Wildlands Association.
Forty-plus ago, when the federal government bought the Big Cypress Swamp and created the 729,000-acre preserve, the government left a loophole that makes the word “preserve” somewhat misleading.
While the National Park Service took charge of the land, the feds did not buy the mineral rights under it. Those still belong to the Collier Resources Co., owned by descendants of the founder of Collier County, onetime advertising kingpin Barron Collier. In the 1920s, he was Florida’s largest private landowner. The Legislature named the whole county after him.  
Despite its preserve status, Collier Resources has been operating two low-producing oil fields there.  The feds have talked about acquiring Collier’s mineral rights since the 1990s, but every attempt has fallen short.
“Back in 2002,” Schwartz said, “a deal was close that would have bought out almost 500,000 acres of Collier Resources’ mineral rights in the Big Cypress National Preserve. That deal fell through …, but $300 million would likely have been more than enough to resurrect it.”
Just think, Mr. DOGE, what a difference Gov. Ron could have made for the Big Cypress! I hope that guilty knowledge dogs his thoughts for the rest of his days.
Saving the sawfish
Mr. DOGE, there are sooooo many better things that DeSantis could have spent $350 million on.
Nicole Johnson via Conservancy of Southwest Florida
For instance, Nicole Johnson from the Conservancy of Southwest Florida pointed out to me that using the money to help imperiled species would have been wonderful, not wasteful.
“We have been asking the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission to continue funding for endangered smalltooth sawfish research, as well as to reinstate funding for trash management programs to coexist with Florida black bears (instead of hunting them),” she told me.
Smalltooth sawfish look like they leaped out of a Fred Flintstone cartoon. They get their names from their saw-like rostrum.
Since 2024, dozens of these prehistoric-looking aquatic species have either washed up dead or been seen spinning crazily before they expired. At least 64 have been found dead so far.
Additional research funding would help the scientists figure out what’s making them crazy — the sawfish, I mean, not the scientists. Or us taxpayers.
As for the bears, that’s just common sense. When they can’t find enough of the food they prefer, they go looking for human garbage as a dietary source. To manage the bears, we’d better manage our human garbage.
Although I think the FWC would still be pushing the bear hunt, despite the fact that there are slightly fewer bears now than there were before the last hunt a decade ago.
A very old error
Mr. DOGE, I hope you’re as dogged as some of the folks I talked to. Cris Costello of the Sierra Club told me that the governor should have spent those millions fixing an error made six decades ago.
In 1968, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the 7,200-foot-long Rodman Dam as part of the controversial Cross-Florida Barge Canal.
The dam halted the flow of the wild Ocklawaha River into the Silver and St. Johns rivers and blocked a regular manatee migration path. Meanwhile, the reservoir created by the dam drowned 9,000 acres of the Ocala National Forest and smothered 20 freshwater springs.
Canal opponents, led by Marjorie Harris Carr, pointed out that the big ditch would damage the aquifer that supplies Florida’s drinking water. They were able to halt its construction by convincing a federal judge to issue an injunction (sound familiar?). Then-President Richard Nixon canceled funding for it.
Carr and others spent years trying to get the dam removed. It still stands today, albeit in far worse shape than when it was new. The Legislature has twice voted to take the first step toward tearing it down, only to hit an inexplicable roadblock.
That’s why Costello says it would have been wonderful to see those wasted millions spent instead on “the breach of Rodman Dam and the reuniting of the Ocklawaha, Silver, and St. John’s rivers and the restoration of so many springs and the surrounding landscape.”
Yet our fine governor didn’t see that as being nearly as important as his polluting pile of putrefaction in the Big Cypress.
Springs and a tower
Last but far from least, it would have been nice to see these millions spent on fixing up our state parks.
You may recall that just last year, another pointless project called for putting golf courses, hotels, and pickleball courts in our state parks. Fortunately, the widespread public outrage convinced the golfers to back out and the Legislature to guarantee that would never happen again.
Estus Whitfield via Florida Conservation Voters
Several popular parks are centered on our incredible springs. Yet our springs are in serious trouble these days, as Estus Whitfield, who served as the top environmental adviser to five Florida governors from both parties, pointed out to me. The springs are in danger right now from rampant pollution that fouls their cleanliness and uncontrolled water consumption that limits their flow.
There was a time, back when Jeb Bush was governor, that Florida launched a drive to clean up and save our springs. Then Rick Scott came along and ditched all that.
Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we had used that $350 million to revive those springs?
Or we could have repaired some of our other big park problems. For instance, there’s the Hobe Mountain Tower at Jonathan Dickinson State Park, the park where DeSantis tried to put three golf courses last year.
The tower, which sits on top of an ancient sand dune, provides a breathtaking view of the entire park. The tower needs saving — and it won’t be cheap.
“Initial estimates suggest that simply repairing or rebuilding the tower as it stands would cost between $150,000 and $200,000,” the Friends of Jonathan Dickinson State Park website says. 
Fixing Hobe Mountain Tower would have been cheaper than building Ronnie’s Folly. And it probably would have lasted longer than two months.
Another name for DOGE
Say, Mr. DOGE, I notice that you’ve gotten awfully quiet. Could that be because you’re busy writing up a lengthy memo to Mr. Ingoglia about what an atrocious waste of money this was?
Could your memo be endorsing the idea of investigating why Ronnie’s Folly was built instead of all the far more worthy projects I’ve mentioned?
Or were you perhaps reflecting on the difficulty of investigating the guy who appointed Ingoglia to his current position?
Because here’s the problem we have, Mr. DOGE.
Instead of DOGE, Ingoglia referred to it recently as FAFO — “Florida Agency for Fiscal Oversight,” he called it. We knew what he meant. But I think he’s the one who’s about to find out.
Whatever y’all come up with as “wasteful spending” by local governments — especially if it’s involving climate change or other legitimate concerns — is likely to pale in comparison to the $350 million for what the governor built in the Big Cypress that lasted only two months.
If FLO-DOGE or FAFO or whatever it’s called next week comes up with a bunch of questionable receipts from, say, Orange County, but ignores this latest DeSantis disaster, nobody can pretend that Ingoglia’s doing his budget-busting in good faith.
They’ll think DOGE is too dodgy. In fact, I bet the next time he demands cooperation from local governments, they’ll just laugh in his face and tell him, “Get along, little DOGE.”

If we want to reduce the cost of electricity, we’re going to need to innovate and take advantage of new technologies.","There have been editorials written and politicians trotting out their plans at town meetings to help us reduce Connecticut’s high electricity prices — some of the highest in the country.  
All the reform advocates have studiously avoided the question of deregulating the power distribution network. (While Connecticut’s energy generation market was deregulated long ago, the distribution companies –United Illuminating and Eversource — are still regulated monopolies.) 
So the fundamental question is this:  do we continue down our current path of allowing the utilities (or, as they prefer, Electricity Distribution Corporations aka EDCs) to have a regulated monopoly or do we change the rules of the game so that there is competition?   And if we do change the rules of the game, what are these changes?
While there have been good reasons to regulate power companies (without power, people die), Connecticut’s regulatory environment is crippling innovation in energy.  We’re in the middle of a technological revolution in electricity production.  While wind power has matured over a few decades, solar cells are finally ready for prime time. 
 Forget what you heard about the costs of solar from years ago.  Electricity from solar cells is now some of the cheapest on the planet.  Not surprisingly, solar installations have taken off, with one third more solar installations globally in 2024 than 2023.  Nearly 600 gigawatt (a GW is a 1,000 megawatts) were installed around the world last year.  Electricity from renewables (solar, wind, hydro) is now 30% of electricity generated –a major shift from fossil fuels.  To put this in perspective, Connecticut’s two nuclear plants at Millstone are a little over 2 GW, so in 2024, the solar cell equivalents of 285 Millstone plants were installed around the world.
Some of you will remember when AT&T held a monopoly on telephone service.  I can recall that, in the early 1980s, a one hour phone call from Massachusetts to Indiana to talk to my girlfriend (during evening hours) was about $10 in 1980s dollars!  That was more than three first run movie tickets back then.  While there were some glitches when Ma Bell was broken up, communications costs have plummeted today.  These drastically lower communications costs have helped grow the economy since customers and businesses can now talk inexpensively no matter where they are.
We are in a similar position now with regards to electricity.  While there hasn’t been much growth in electricity usage for the past decade in the U.S., that’s rapidly changing.  Heat pumps, electric vehicless, and data centers are all going to need more electricity — a lot of it.  What we’re seeing now, though, is that adoption of some of these technologies has been slowed by the high cost of electricity so we’re not getting the savings we should.
In 2017, the Connecticut legislature saw that there was a problem with electricity costs in the state and set up the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority’s Innovative Energy Solutions Program.  This program called for people outside the utility industry to submit ideas to help the state meet its various goals ranging from storage to decarbonization.  (My group submitted two Phase 1 proposals which were accepted in 2024). Unfortunately, the program hasn’t delivered on its lofty goals, but at least it has showed that there was awareness of the problem.
A recent editorial made the following suggestions, but fundamentally, it’s just more of the same.  We will not see major savings in the costs of electricity.

Modernize the grid. Sure- why not?  Except that United Illuminating’s territory (about 20% of the state, mostly around Bridgeport and New Haven) is actually pretty up to date while Eversource’s territory is more of a hodgepodge.  There doesn’t seem to be much difference in rates though.  New infrastructure is what’s driving the costs of electricity to go up nationally, even though generating costs are coming down. Just look at your bill and see how big those delivery charges are.
Reduce peak demand. Currently the grid is most economically inefficient when it’s run flat out.  When we need more electricity than average days, i.e. peak demand, the costs skyrocket.  Why not try to reduce peak demands?  Well, the climate has other ideas.  Do we really want to be telling people that they shouldn’t run their air conditioners during a heat wave?  Does anyone think that heat waves are going to become less extreme in the coming years?
Use data to tell us where to string new wires. Determining where the infrastructure is needed still involves a crystal ball of predicting what new demand is going to look like.  These kinds of predictions are only as good as the data, otherwise, it’s garbage in, garbage out.
Wait for “cheaper” nuclear. It’s going to be a minimum of 10 years for new technology plants that have already been permitted to come online and there’s no data to show that these plants are actually going to be less expensive to operate.  What are we supposed to do before these plants become available? Take out another mortgage to pay our electric bills?
Rely on existing natural gas plants. We’ve already seen how the swing in natural gas prices can drive up the costs: recall the Christmas of 2023   If we have domestically produced solar, we are going to have predictable pricing for the foreseeable future as the price of sunlight isn’t going to change.  The rest of the country is adding solar and storage in a hurry. Why aren’t we?
More regional cooperation. Unfortunately, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), after dragging its heels, announced some very modest new transmission corridors which aren’t anywhere close to Connecticut.  Simply put, we’re on our own to solve this problem.

None of the suggestions that have been put forward will dramatically lower our rates.  If we want to reduce the cost of electricity, (I think 50% is a reasonable goal. That’s the national average) we’re going to need to innovate and take advantage of new technologies.  Unfortunately, the EDCs do not have innovation in their DNA, so it’s up to us to tell our legislators what we want.  Yes, the legislators have gotten the message that high electricity costs are a problem, but the EDCs haven’t put forward any really useful ideas.  That’s now up to us and the first step is to deregulate the industry sufficiently to allow innovation.  There’s a lot of moving pieces here which makes this transition challenging.  Trying to do it piecemeal doesn’t work- it’s like trying to build a house one room at a time.  But if we don’t do this now, electricity prices are going to continue to rise.
Here are some ideas:

Businesses and homeowners should have more of a choice for who supplies their electricity. Should they simply buy it from the utility or own their individual generation (most likely solar) and storage?  There’s a combination of local and state regulations that drives up the soft costs (soft costs are what’s not hardware, i.e. financing and legal costs) of solar and storage installations dramatically. Larger installations for commercial and industrial businesses have a lower percentage of soft costs which may make increasing these installations more attractive for these customers, but if soft costs overall are reduced, then energy distribution companies are going to have to compete (finally!) for their current customers dollars.  Forget subsidies for everyone except low-income people since the technology to produce your own electricity and store it is cheap enough– if we don’t have excessive bureaucracy!  Not all customers are going to be in this position, but this competition should help lower prices.
Allow Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). This is perhaps the best way for customers to get compensated by the energy companies for their own generation and storage.  Virtual Power Plants reduce peak demand quickly, and so provide a benefit for everyone.
Stop exporting electricity. The state exports electricity which makes no economic sense.  Typically, a region with a low cost of production can export to somewhere else where production costs are higher.  But in Connecticut, we have some of the highest electricity prices in the country– and we’re exporting ~30% of our electricity to neighboring states?
Pay for storage. Why does the state export electricity?  Because we don’t pay for storage.  The economics of the grid were designed to drive construction of new generation and transmission– not to store electricity till it is needed.  Deregulated states like Texas are adding storage frantically because it solves multiple problems: reduces the need for new generation and transmission, stabilizes the grid, reduces peak demand, reduces emissions, and allows arbitrage– buying electricity when its cheap to use when its expensive.  The issue has been that no one has come up with a good way to pay for storage.  We need to try some new business models to pay for storage. But we also need to be prepared to make changes if they don’t work well.

Not everyone lives in a home that could power itself in the near term.  People in apartment buildings need power and they still will need the grid and utilities.  While utilities are going to lose customers– probably both residential and commercial especially in the suburbs — in the cities, electricity consumption will probably increase as heat pumps, EVs and data centers proliferate.  Overall, utilities may wind up selling more electricity than they do now, even if they do lose some residential and commercial and industrial customers.
We are going to need more electricity in the coming years– that’s pretty clear.  But if we don’t produce electricity more cheaply and without increasing CO2 emissions, we’re in a lot of trouble.  Fortunately, the technology to reduce costs as well as emissions is already here. We just need business models to use it more efficiently.   
We need our legislators to change the rules so that utilities operate more efficiently and have to face some competition.  If we do this correctly, Connecticut may be seen as a more attractive place to live, instead of just a little state with high electricity costs.

Joe Courtney,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/04/aukus-agreement-is-chinas-worst-nightmare/,"AUKUS is the strongest, most effective plan for the United States to deter China’s malign behavior in the Indo-Pacific.","On June 11, 2025, the news broke that U.S. Under Secretary of Defense Elbridge Colby would lead a Pentagon review of the Australia-United Kingdom-United States security agreement (AUKUS). The Department of Defense has since articulated that this effort will be “an empirical and clear-eyed assessment of the initiative.”
If that standard is applied, the assessment must conclude, as a similar 2025 review in London did, that AUKUS is the strongest, most effective plan for the United States to deter China’s malign behavior in the Indo-Pacific.

U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney,   Credit: Lisa Hagen / CT Mirror
China certainly knows that AUKUS’ promise to accelerate the deployment of advanced defense technology by the three participating nations, including the sale of conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, will counter the growing strength of its PLA Navy and missile forces in the Indo-Pacific.
China has repeatedly complained about AUKUS in public and in private diplomatic channels, which should speak volumes about its value to Under Secretary Colby as he conducts his investigation. AUKUS, in a nutshell, will blunt China’s regional advantage that threatens the 80-year success of the free and open Pacific.
Much of the AUKUS skepticism in the United States is premised on the misguided notion that the technology being shared and sold among the three allies will create an unacceptable drain on the U.S. military. Since AUKUS is not a binding treaty that commits Australia and the UK to every imaginable conflict in which the United States could be engaged, skeptics argue that the cost and risks of sharing too much are unacceptable.
Under Secretary Colby himself publicly questioned the planned sale of three Virginia-class submarines to Australia last year, before re-entering the Pentagon in 2024, citing concerns that the US Navy cannot afford it. This part of the plan, developed in 2022–23 by the leadership of all three countries as part of the AUKUS “Optimal Pathway,” is essential.
Australia operates an aging fleet of diesel submarines, which will need to be phased out in the 2030s, before its own domestic industrial base is able to replace them with new submarines. The U.S. defense industrial base, despite criticism, is expected to have delivered 28 Virginia-class submarines by the end of 2026, since the nuclear-powered attack submarine was first commissioned in 2004. Ten additional Virginia-class boats will be in the works after 2026. Those 28 submarines are in addition to over 20 Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarines and three Seawolf-class fast-attack submarines currently in the U.S. Navy fleet. For comparison, the Chinese Navy currently operates six nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines, while the British Royal Navy operates five.
Looking past the 2025 submarine tally, Under Secretary Colby’s review should focus on the evolving capacity of the U.S. industrial base when Australia actually purchases its submarines in the 2030s. A key part of this equation is the massive investment by Congress in the U.S. submarine industrial base over the last seven years, which is now coming to fruition.

But CT needs to do more.,"At this moment, when all eyes are on the impact of federal budget cuts on our communities, it is important to highlight one of the most successful accomplishments of this last legislative session here in Connecticuty – the Early Childhood Education Endowment. 
We thank Gov. Ned Lamont for listening to advocates and residents who testified, and for demonstrating leadership, compassion and wisdom. This was no small feat. Our state is now a national model. By supporting the Endowment Fund, our elected leaders put their arms around our youngest residents and their families. Working families won’t have to make a Hobson’s Choice between caring for their children (and not making a living wage) or working to earn a living (just to spend it all on childcare).
This is the role of responsible and responsive government: to use resources and revenue wisely, ensuring all residents can thrive and contribute back to their communities. Those of us in philanthropy have traditionally played a partnering role by providing grants and other support to the nonprofits that are the backbones of our communities. We are prepared to step up today, as we did during the pandemic. We aspire to do our best in these times to ensure that every one of our residents is supported.
The Community Foundation of Eastern Connecticut has led a campaign to “End Child Poverty Now” in our state for the last two years, with about 120 partners ranging from universities and nonprofit organizations to think tanks and municipal partners. We embarked on this campaign believing that we could do so much better in our wealthy state. We believe that every child should have what they need to reach their utmost potential.
Providing childcare for families who can’t afford it is an essential step in creating strong communities. But we need to do more. All school children should be provided with healthy school meals. Best practices in the United States and other nations demonstrate that providing nutritious meals for children and youth, especially those in struggling households, enhances their performance and reduces stress on families and teachers. Investing in school meals is a smart investment in our future generation.
As our elected leaders head into the special session this fall, we ask that they build on the success of the last session and invest in structures that can protect those who are vulnerable and promote the basic rights of all our residents. We know that the federal cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and other programs will be devastating. Difficult choices must be made. Strategic choices should be made. 
Investing in school meals will ensure that children perform well in school. It will support families’ economic stability. No child should suffer from hunger and malnutrition on account of their parent’s economic status. After all, we are one of the wealthiest states in this nation. Let’s ensure that our children are well fed so that they and their families have the opportunity to thrive in this great state.

As of Wednesday there were three cases of the virus in Davis County, said Trevor Warner, communications manager at the Davis County Health Department. Two of them were neuroinvasive, a severe form of the infection that affects the central nervous system, leading the patients to be hospitalized. 
An individual over 60 years old died at the hospital last week, Warner said. It’s the first death related to the virus in the state since 2023.
“(The neuroinvasive form of the virus) can result in some long-term complications or even death,” Warner added. “So, the more severe infections, those will include a high fever, neck stiffness, the person will be disoriented, and in some cases, have tremors or muscle weakness.”

The neuroinvasive virus may also lead to other serious conditions, including meningitis, encephalitis or paralysis, the Utah County Health Department said in a news release Wednesday. However, most people infected with the virus don’t develop symptoms.
The Utah County Health Department reported five probable human cases of the West Nile virus. Four of them are neuroinvasive. 
The virus has been confirmed in mosquito pools and human cases across different counties in the state, so local agencies are urging residents to avoid mosquito bites. 
Health officials advised wearing insect repellent when outdoors, especially at dawn or dusk, as well as wearing long sleeves, pants and socks at those times, which is when mosquitoes are the most active.
Utahns are also advised to eliminate standing water around homes, even small containers, ensure that doors and windows are screened, and take extra precaution if they are older or immunocompromised to avoid severe illness.
In Davis County, Warner said, residents can call the mosquito abatement district to request an inspection to identify potential issues with standing water or any other sources of mosquitoes. When needed, the district can spray those areas to avoid mosquitoes.
“It’s not uncommon to have West Nile positive pools and have human cases of West Nile. But what is a little uncommon is the amount of neuroinvasive cases, and then the fact that we did have a death,” Warner said.

That was driven largely by outages at Millstone nuclear station.","Connecticut continues to lag behind its goal to slash greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century, according to a new report released Wednesday by the state’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
Emissions of carbon dioxide — the most prevalent of the climate-altering greenhouse gases — rose by 1.5% in 2023 to reach 35 million metric tons, according to the report.
That was largely driven by an increase of more than 1 million metric tons of CO2 from power plants, which the report attributed to a prolonged outage of one of the reactors at the Millstone Nuclear Power Station that necessitated the burning of more fossil fuels to meet electric demand. Smaller increases in emissions were also reported from industrial and agricultural sources, according to the report.
But Connecticut otherwise made progress toward reducing emissions from the state’s two biggest sources: vehicle exhaust and heating for residential buildings.
“The evidence is in: greenhouse emissions in 2023 declined in transportation and buildings, as a result of strong federal and state programs that provide clean air, improve energy affordability, and protect public health,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said in a statement included with the release of the report. 
Dykes said the effects of climate change are being felt across Connecticut in the form of heat waves, wildfire smoke and increasingly intense storms — all of which are likely to get worse if sufficient efforts are not made nationally and globally to reduce CO2. And the report came just days after the Trump administration ordered a halt to work on one of the state’s largest planned renewable energy projects, Revolution Wind.
“Addressing these impacts continues to be an urgent challenge,” Dykes said. “As we celebrate this progress in reducing emissions, we are concerned that recent actions by the [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency] to roll back power plant regulations, vehicle fuel economy standards, and even the Endangerment Finding, will remove critical federal tools that contributed to this progress.”
The annual report, known formally as the Connecticut Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory, is required under the state’s Global Warming Solutions Act. That law, passed in 2008, set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% of 2001 levels by 2050. 
The law also set several incremental targets on the path toward meeting that goal, which started in 2020.
Connecticut met its initial emissions-reduction target in 2020, but is behind the pace of reductions needed to meet its future targets in 2030 and beyond. SOURCE: Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
While Connecticut was able to meet its initial reduction targets that year, the achievement was largely the result of a the steep decline in vehicles on the road during the COVID-19 lockdown. Overall emissions have steadily increased since then, though they remain below pre-pandemic levels.
If current trends continue, the report found that Connecticut will fall about 5 percentage points below its next target: a 45% reduction by 2030. 
Lori Brown, the executive director of the Connecticut League of Conservation Voters, said the state’s experience during the pandemic, when levels of air pollution dropped significantly, showcased the benefits of meeting its long-term goals. 
“It’s not just a theory, you know, it’s proof,” Brown said. “It’s the kind of thing that’s right in front of your face that shows we can really make a difference. It’s not too big for us to change the air quality in our state.” 
Brown was also critical of President Donald Trump’s rollback of many environmental and climate regulations, but she noted that data behind the most recently reported increase in emissions predated his current administration. 
She also chastised local leaders, including Gov. Ned Lamont, for supporting a proposed expansion of natural gas pipelines into the state. “It’s easy to point the finger at Trump right now, because essentially, he’s doing everything he can to destroy clean energy,” she said.
Prior to the pandemic, Connecticut’s most significant decreases in emissions came from the power sector. Emissions there declined nearly 80% between 2001 and 2022 as the state retired a number of highly polluting coal and oil-fired power plants while making strides in energy efficiency and building new, cleaner sources of power generation such as solar. 
(Connecticut is a net exporter of electricity, and the state’s greenhouse gas inventory calculates emissions based only on the power consumed within the state.)
Still, the vast majority of the electricity produced in Connecticut comes from natural gas and the Millstone Nuclear Plant. In 2023, both of the plant’s two active reactors experienced extended outages, according to the report, including one outage that was due to refueling.
As a result the plant produced less electricity than in 2022, and its output had to be picked up by other fossil fuel burning plants.
Susan Adams, the state director of government affairs and economic development for Millstone’s owner, Dominion Energy, said in a statement Wednesday that the data highlighted the facility’s role in producing carbon-free electricity and reducing emissions.
“While 2023 was an anomaly, with both a higher number of outages and longer-than-usual events, looking ahead Millstone will continue to operate with regularly scheduled refueling and maintenance outages, but we do not anticipate any extended or prolonged outages,” Adams said. “These planned outages are carefully scheduled during periods of lower energy demand, typically in the spring and fall, to minimize any impact on the grid and to help reduce reliance on fossil fuels.”
The state’s largest source of CO2 emissions comes from the transportation sector, which includes fuels burned to power cars, trucks, trains and planes. Those emissions fell by 2% in 2023, despite an overall increase in vehicle miles driven.
Increased fuel efficiency across all kinds of vehicles were cited as “the predominant driving force” in reducing in transportation emissions, along with a growing number of electric vehicles, according to the report. In addition, the report said a relatively mild winter and greater energy-efficiency measures resulted in a 5.6% decrease in emissions from residential buildings.
Emissions from commercial buildings, wastewater, solid waste and natural gas leaks all fell slightly or saw no change. 
In addition to the goal to gradually reduce emissions over the coming decades, Connecticut lawmakers earlier this year passed legislation pledging to achieve “net-zero” emissions by 2050. Net-zero emissions can be achieved when gases are sequestered or removed from the atmosphere through carbon-capture technology or more natural means such as planting forests and other green spaces.
In 2023, a total of 4.9 million tons of CO2 were sequestered in Connecticut, or about 14% of the state’s total emissions that year.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP22077710170842-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-03 21:57:25.969140

The five-year grant will fund the third phase of the UAMS Center for Studies of Host Response to Cancer Therapy, according to a UAMS news release. The research initiative, under the federal Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence, is the nation’s first to solely focus on the side effects of cancer treatments like radiation and chemotherapy, the release states.
Research leader and UAMS professor Marjan Boerma said the funding will allow the initiative to expand its studies into immunotherapy, “which can cause significant, but poorly understood, side effects,” according to the release.
“Most cancer patients experience side effects from their treatment, sometimes mild, sometimes severe,” said Boerma, associate director of basic science at the UAMS Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute. “If we can predict who will develop those side effects, or develop strategies to reduce them, we can make therapies safer, increase patients’ quality of life and even allow doctors to safely deliver higher doses when needed.”
The Center for Studies of Host Response to Cancer Therapy has supported 12 research project leaders and 14 pilot studies in its first two phases, according to the news release. The Radiation Biology Shared Resource within the UAMS Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute began as part of this initiative.
The funding for the third phase brings the total federal investment in the project above $27 million in the past decade, the release states.
UAMS has spent years working toward National Cancer Institute (NCI) designation, which would bring in more federal funding for research and create hundreds of new UAMS jobs, the health system has stated.
The Rockefeller Cancer Institute plans to submit its NCI application to the National Institutes of Health in January, Arkansas Business reported in August. If successful, UAMS would be home to the first NCI-designated in Arkansas, Mississippi or Louisiana.
President Donald Trump’s administration has proposed a 40% National Institutes of Health budget cut, and the potential impact on the NCI application and designation process is unclear, Arkansas Business reported.

In a lawsuit filed in federal court that reads more […],"Rex Wu testifies at a Montana Board of Regents meeting in 2023. (Screenshot of video testimony)A man who recently admitted to making hoax death threats on the campus of Montana’s largest university has been sued in federal court by two former Montana State University students for his part in orchestrating the hoax by framing them and allegedly destroying their reputations.
In a lawsuit filed in federal court that reads more like a mystery novel than court brief, an attorney laid out the details of a conspiracy, alleging former student Rex Wu orchestrated hoax death threats and violent racially charged messages against his friend, Alexandra Lin. Both used the incidents to push them toward victory in student elections, the lawsuit says, while destroying the reputations of two other students. Court documents lay out the scheme Wu used to allegedly frame the two other students so as to look as if Wu and Lin had been racially targeted as Chinese-Americans. 
The lawsuit asks a federal court judge to find Wu guilty of defamation and putting plaintiffs Dylan Dean and Daria Danley in a false light that made it nearly impossible to attend Montana State University. The lawsuit also seeks punitive damages as well as attorney’s fees, and a judgment for the pain and suffering inflicted upon both of them by Wu’s actions.
While the lawsuit does not name Lin as part of the suit, because claims against her have passed the statute of limitations, the lawsuit alleges that she was aware of Wu’s work, at one point even telling him to stop the attention he was drawing to the situation.
When contacted about the new lawsuit on Wednesday evening, Lin called the allegations an insult to the victims.
“It’s insulting to the victims of stalking and harassment,” she said. “It’s an insult to the great work the FBI and all the Montana officials who worked on it.”
In 2021-’22, the Montana State University campus was roiled with allegations that several groups, including Asian-American students and the LGBTQ+ community were being targeted. Even worse, advocates for those groups said the administration of former President Waded Cruzado had turned a blind eye to the activities, which included threats of a mass shooting at an LGBTQ+ Valentine’s Day dance.
Lin became the center and the alleged target of the violence when the AGD sorority, of which she was a member, allegedly refused to use preferred pronouns, court documents said. That controversy escalated when Lin appeared to be the target of hate letters that urged her to kill herself, or threatened that she would be killed because of her Asian ancestry. Lin would claim that she was targeted by Danley and sought a protective restraining order, which barred Danley from campus events and booted her from the AGD sorority. At one point, Lin claimed that she had discovered a noose in her bedroom closet as a invitation to kill herself.
Meanwhile,  court documents allege Wu created a sophisticated series of accounts that expressed support for neo-Nazi views and invited the MSU community to push back against diversity. The lawsuit claims that Wu created email accounts that linked Danley and Dean to the racially charged messages, and that Wu specifically leveraged his friendship with Dean to make it appear as if Dean had created the accounts or supported the views. This also landed Dean in trouble, getting several different credentials revoked, including a security TSA pre-check denied, as well as causing him to graduate late.
Both Dean and Danley identified as “conservative, white” students, but “no indications of racial hostility.”
The lawsuit claims the genesis of the controversy began when Danley rebuffed Lin for her use of preferred pronouns, as well as allegations that she had rejected Lin’s sexual advances. The lawsuit says those rejected advances caused Wu and Lin to concoct an elaborate campaign to boost their individual profiles as they both ran for MSU’s student senate, as well as open a platform for them to chastise the university for not caring more about minority students.
“Even before any investigation occurred, Danley’s life collapsed. Her sorority expelled her,” the court filing said. “But the university maintained the discriminatory no-contact order for 18 months.”
Danley was forced to go to federal court to remove the no-contact order, and the university attempted to make her go to sensitivity training, which she refused, said her attorney Matthew Monforton.
The court documents say after that incident, Danley was “effectively brand(ed) a dangerous racist.”
In February 2022, MSU dismissed all charges against Danley, but, the lawsuit claims, “only after devastating her reputation and college experience.”
The court documents say that Wu and Lin were friends and after MSU dropped charges, he designed a cyberstalking campaign designed to make it look like Danley was still targeting Lin. From an account, “DARIA_DD78” Wu is alleged to have sent messages that threatened to “kill the ch—k.”
“One of these days you will get what’s coming to you. This isn’t Missoula in real Montana we kill g—-ks like you,” another message said.
“Wu and Lin became student senate candidates and exploited their fabricated racial threats to bolster their campaigns,” court documents allege, including making impassioned pleas for the Montana Board of Regents to do something about MSU’s failure to protect “marginalized students.”
Wu followed Lin’s statements at the meeting of the Regents.
Court documents also accuse Wu of fabricating documents tied to Dean that showed Nazi swastikas as well as pornographic images. Dean was identified as a member of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group, and was falsely linked to sending threatening messages to Lin in March 2023, including: “You better watch out we know where you live ch—k.”
Hours after that threat was made, Lin received a pizza at her house in Dean’s name.
By that time, news of the events of campus has risen to statewide awareness, with the Montana Human Rights Network calling for more investigation by MSU officials.
According to text messages included in the lawsuit, Wu sent messages to his friend Dean marveling at the media attention that had been generated by the series of events: “You have Fox and CNN out here. Lmao huge national coverage in some town in Montana.”
The MSU student newspaper published an article that said “both the pizza order and the Google form threat were attributed to Dylan Dean.”
“This false attribution in the student newspaper further solidified Dean’s reputation as a violent racist among his peers and faculty,” the lawsuit said.
In April 2023, after a series of articles, including one in the Bozeman Daily Chronicle, Lin sent a text message to Wu to stop “becoming part of the issue.” And she told him, “We have to focus on the really serious s—t…S—t is on the front page of the (C)hronicle.”
The next day, Lin and Wu held a “teach in” to denounce the threats and share their experiences.
However, the day after the teach-in, Linn was removed as a candidate for the student senate because she “discouraged other candidates’ participation based on a protected class.”  Officials had learned that Lin had sent a text message that accused “two privileged white dudes” of “putting self interest above the common goal” by refusing to withdraw from the student senate, according to the court documents.
  The hoax surfaces 

The court documents filed on Tuesday give a glimpse into how Wu was eventually caught in his role. In December 2024, Wu texted one of Danley’s friends: “Lin did the pronouns stink because Daria wouldn’t sleep with her.”
When FBI agents interviewed Wu in February, he admitted to sending the harassing messages, the court documents said. In July, Wu pleaded guilty to federal cyberstalking charges.
“Dean and Danley did not learn of Wu’s identity as the author of the racial death threats until they learned from the press of Wu’s plea in court,” the court documents said.
The court documents said that the College Democrats of Montana expelled Lin from their organization in 2024 for “online stalking of a 13-year-old political organizer and over $1,000 in merchandise.”
“We do not associate, in any way, with Alexandra Lin,” the group said, via court documents.

(Courtesy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) OMAHA — Again on Wednesday, a federal judge rejected the U.S. government’s effort to deny bond to a worker detained and facing deportation proceedings following their arrest in Omaha’s Glenn Valley Foods immigration raid.
This time, U.S. District Court Senior Judge Joseph Bataillon presided over a combined hearing in Omaha for three undocumented workers. His decision mirrored that of similar cases he had ruled on the past several weeks.

Bataillon found that the government was violating due process rights of all three by unlawfully detaining them under an “automatic stay” of a bond an immigration judge earlier had determined was appropriate.
He ordered the detainees to be immediately released upon reposting the respective bond amounts that weeks ago had been set by an immigration judge, but then swiftly challenged by the federal government.
The three — Sabina Carmona-Lorenzo, Diego Palma Perez and Ernesto Cortes Fernandez — were among about 75 Glenn Valley plant workers arrested during a June 10 workforce enforcement operation led by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
ICE described the operation as a “federal criminal investigation into over 100 cases of stolen identities.” But the three in court Wednesday have faced no criminal charges, their lawyers said. They face administrative offenses and deportation for allegedly being in the country without authorization.
Federal attorneys representing the Department of Homeland Security and ICE challenged the bonds based on new July 8 guidance from the Trump administration that looks to end bond hearings for almost all undocumented immigrants as they fight deportation. 
That mandatory detention guidance hangs on a section of immigration law applied historically to newly arrived migrants, not those who, like the Glenn Valley workers, already had been in the U.S. for years, even if they entered without authorization.
Bataillon noted that ICE had arrested the Glenn Valley workers under one provision of the law, but then government attorneys wanted to hold them under the different section of law that applied to migrants who just arrived.
Attorney Christopher Ferretti, representing the feds, said during the hearing that his team still asserts that no-bond should apply. Given “short shrift” in the discussion he said, is the government’s interest in “controlling its borders.”
Jamie Arango, a Lincoln immigration attorney representing two of the Glenn Valley workers Wednesday, said the government’s strategy to prolong detention can drive some migrants to self-deport.
 “It’s depriving them of due process,” she said.

Arango said family commitments led her clients to endure more than two months in a North Platte jail. Both have several children, she said, and have been in the country working for decades. “They didn’t want to leave their families behind.”
She said she represents another Glenn Valley worker in a similar situation, awaiting a federal hearing.
Arango said there are numerous people like her clients in Nebraska and across the country. “They’re not letting anyone out on bond,” she said, adding that it is clogging up the immigration justice system. 
Grant Friedman of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska, who represented Carmona-Lorenzo, said the ACLU has at least one more client arrested in the Glenn Valley raid awaiting a similar hearing.
Bataillon last month ordered the release of three other Glenn Valley workers held under similar circumstances.
Carmona-Lorenzo had been in the U.S. for more than 20 years when she was detained in June, her lawyers said. She and her husband have five children, all of whom are U.S. citizens. Three are minors, one is in college, and the other serves in the military.
The Glenn Valley workers’ lawyers challenged the prolonged detention in federal civil rights lawsuits that argue the automatic stay unlawfully violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and goes beyond ICE authority by overriding an immigration judge’s decision on a bond.

“There is no due process when the government, who lost the argument in court, gets to do what they want anyway,” the ACLU wrote.
ICE officials have said repeatedly that the focus after the raid should be on American “victims” whose identities were allegedly stolen by migrants to work at the Glenn Valley plant.
The new no-bond practice urged in the Trump administration’s memo is the subject of a national class action lawsuit filed by immigrant rights advocates, including the national ACLU.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/busICE.jpg,,,2025-09-03 20:57:41.378228

(Photo by Emily Fitzgerald/Washington State Standard)Washington loggers, school leaders and conservation activists on Wednesday decried the state lands commissioner’s proposal to set aside 77,000 acres of older forests while opening 29,000 acres back up for logging. 
Some said the plan, announced by Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove last week, didn’t do enough to protect the state’s older forests, while others said it would lead to layoffs, business closures and delay of critical school construction projects.
“Not only will this set-aside acreage jeopardize manufacturing jobs in our state, it also threatens beneficiaries with staggering losses in revenue,” said Austin Serrano, a forester who gave public comment during the Board of Natural Resources’ monthly meeting on Wednesday 
Criticism of the plan dominated the meeting’s hourlong public comment period. 
Under Upthegrove’s plan, 29,000 acres of older forests will remain available for harvest. Most of the roughly two-dozen timber sales that were paused in January will proceed.
Members of the timber industry told the board that Upthegrove’s decision to set aside older forest land would hurt their businesses. 
The representatives of logging companies and mills said the bulk of their timber supply comes from Department of Natural Resources lands. Older trees are necessary to make certain specialty wood products like power poles, they said.  
Pausing timber sales has already put the state behind schedule for the sustainable harvest level for the year, and the decision to set aside 77,000 acres of highly-profitable older forests creates further uncertainty within the industry, one lumber company representative said. 
A representative of another company said their business is looking at laying off the bulk of its 35-member crew until the paused sales move forward and additional timber sales are approved. 
Eatonville School District is waiting on its share of revenues from a paused timber sale to help fund a stadium improvement project. 
The district is relying on those dollars to cover the interest on a capital levy passed by voters in 2024. State law doesn’t allow districts to use tax revenue to pay the interest, according to Eatonville School Board President Ronda Litzenberger. 
“Our community believed in this project because we believed that the trust would be honored. We’re doing everything we can to uphold our end of the promise, and we’re asking for your partnership in upholding the state’s,” Litzenberger said during public comment on Wednesday. 
Counties and schools have received logging revenue from the federal government since 1906. 
A federal program to offset timber revenue lapsed at the end of 2023, making more school districts dependent on those funds to operate. 
“We have a good program now that’s providing good, solid, revenue, predictable revenue,” Mt. Baker School Board President Russ Pfeiffer-Hoyt said after Wednesday’s meeting. 
He said the commissioner’s plan “doesn’t make sense” because it will jeopardize that revenue by setting aside older forest land and count on less reliable ways to generate money from forests, like carbon markets.
Chris Reykdal, the state superintendent of public instruction and member of the Board of Natural Resources, supports Upthegrove’s proposal. 
Reykdal’s longterm goal is to fully fund Washington’s schools with state dollars and to not have to rely on timber revenue, which he said has been dwindling for years. 
“It’s inevitable that they’re going to have to change,” Reykdal said of school funding models after the meeting. 
The Washington State Association of Counties, which represents the state’s 39 counties, is evaluating the proposal. 
“We’ve had significant concerns about the process that led to the commissioner’s decision,” association spokesperson Hart Stanley said during public comment, adding that last week’s press conference was a surprise to the organization and its members. 
“Counties are the primary beneficiaries of these working trust lands and to be excluded from such a significant decision is eroding our ability to maintain trust,” Stanley said. 
A spokesperson for the American Forest Resource Council said the regional trade organization was also concerned Upthegrove acted without completing a public process or going through the Board of Natural Resources. 
The Department of Natural Resources says it doesn’t need approval from the board or the Legislature to set aside the forestland.
The board sets policies to guide how the Department of Natural Resources manages the state’s nearly 6 million acres of state public land, including about 3 million acres of “trust lands” that produce revenue – mostly from logging – for schools, counties and other parts of government.
The board also approves logging sales. 
The 29,000 acres of older forests not set aside for conservation will be enough to honor all of the state’s trust agreements for the next decade, according to the agency. 
Upthegrove has said that gives the department time to find alternative methods, like the sale of credits on the carbon market, to make up for any lost revenue. 
Meanwhile, conservation activists expressed dismay Wednesday that many of the proposed timber sales for the next five years were going forward. They said the plan failed to protect what they saw as the most ecologically valuable areas of older forest. 
“The order was celebrated as a bold action, but when it comes to legacy forests, it’s sort of like a rebranding of the status quo as new conservation,” said Sarah Gardam of Whatcom County.
She was one of several who criticized the maps of the older forests created by Department of Natural Resources staff, saying the acres set aside for conservation are primarily strips of trees that are not part of continuous forests. 
Those who voiced support of Upthegrove’s proposal also acknowledged that the maps need work, but said it is a promising concept. 
The maps are still being developed and have not yet been finalized, the Department of Natural Resources said. 
It is standard practice for board members to not respond to public comment during the meeting. Upthegrove, likewise, did not respond to public testimony during the meeting.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/dave-upthegrove-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-03 20:57:41.378228

A call on the governor to temporarily suspend Public Service Commission President Brad Molnar will continue despite an attempt from Molnar to rescind it — but with support from staff to hold firm on the complaint against him.
Wednesday, commissioners voted 3-to-2 against a motion from Molnar to pull back a complaint PSC Vice President Jennifer Fielder made to Gov. Greg Gianforte.
The letter asked the governor to suspend the president while an investigation into allegations of professional misconduct proceeds.
Commissioner Randy Pinocci supported Molnar’s motion to recall the letter, but Fielder and Commissioners Annie Bukacek and Jeff Welborn opposed the rescission.
Fielder, who wrote the complaint to the governor on behalf of an internal “response team,” said she did not want to write the letter, and in fact, had counseled Molnar one-on-one on his behavior for months.
But Fielder said the team decided to ask the governor to intervene after it received substantiated evidence Molnar had engaged in retaliation.
Fielder said Molnar’s disruptions included a threat to “take out” anyone involved in filing complaints against him, and she said he has been untruthful and dismissive about the allegations against him.
The PSC has characterized the allegations as complaints of “unprofessional conduct.”
At the meeting Wednesday, Fielder also said they include allegations of sexual harassment, which could be jokes, slurs or innuendo.
Fielder said Molnar had repeatedly interfered with the investigation — attempting to undo a contract with a firm the PSC had hired and denying payment of bills.
She also said Molnar refused to meet with the team unless it was on his terms. Fielder said his tactics have created delays, even though it aims to complete its work.
“There’s a big obstacle in our ability to do that,” said Fielder, also acting chairwoman of the team. “That obstacle is President Molnar. And so we are trying to remove that obstacle for a temporary time period so that we can complete our work.”
Molnar has denied interfering in the team’s work and said his public calls for due process are not retaliation but protected speech. He also said he told a joke but did not see any sexual innuendo in it and has mocked the title of the head of the PSC as inflated — president instead of chairman.
“That doesn’t mean the governor can overturn an election. It doesn’t,” Molnar said.
The governor and all five commissioners are Republicans.
Staff members expressed support for Molnar’s experience — he served on the PSC from 2005 to 2012 before taking office again in January — but pleaded for commissioners to allow the letter to the governor to stand.
PSC staff member Patricia Trooien said employees have voiced complaints about Molnar’s conduct, and staff have a right to be heard as well as their confidentiality protected.
Trooien said she believes the investigation should continue with full cooperation from Molnar.
“I have personally seen your good heart, and I believe you have the capacity to be empathetic, compassionate and fair,” Trooien said. “Your refusal to participate in the investigation is causing damage to you, those around you and this agency.”
She said Molnar has an obligation to take full responsibility for his actions and for the perceptions of his actions.
“I ask you to please take ownership of your actions by participating in the investigation,” Trooien said.
PSC Executive Director Alana Lake also weighed in on the matter — but said it was the last thing she wanted to do.
Lake said Molnar’s experience adds “immense value” to the agency, and she respects his commitment to the people he serves.
But Lake said she values transparency and due process, and even a commissioner is not above the law.
Despite Molnar’s statements to the contrary, Lake said she and other managers took steps to initially address complaints against Molnar at the “lowest levels” possible and with multiple internal counseling sessions.
But she said those less formal attempts failed, and the situation escalated.
She said Molnar told her directly that he would “take out” anyone involved in the process against him and said he had hired a lawyer and private investigator to “go after these individuals.”
“There were no other options than to seek outside investigative support to address the issues,” Lake said.
The PSC retained outside counsel and contracted with a management and communications firm for up to $10,000 for the investigation.
Lake also said retaliation has continued and grown during the past few months, which is one of the reasons for the suspension request.
“I have exhausted all the tools I have as the chief of staff to protect our staff and commissioners from retaliation,” Lake said.
Additionally, Commissioner Annie Bukacek said a “reasonable person” could believe that holding a press conference as Molnar did would discourage witnesses from coming forward.
Molnar announced the investigation to the public in a press conference in July and raised concerns about due process then. He has waived his privacy rights in the matter.
Bukacek also said complaints were lodged against Molnar before June or July — she said she personally made a complaint “several months” earlier.
In her comments, Fielder reviewed the recent history of the workplace climate at the Public Service Commission. Audits had identified numerous problems.
Fielder said the PSC had made progress, but even just a year and a half ago, an audit said staff were concerned about the effectiveness of a new structure.
“Particularly, the audit noted that staff were concerned about management’s ability to address inappropriate behavior in the department,” Fielder said.
She said the agency is obligated to stop inappropriate behavior to both act responsibly and protect staff and to protect itself from liability.
Commissioner Welborn led the meeting, and at one point, he asked Molnar if he would be willing to voluntarily place himself on administrative leave — “that kind of thing can be a tough pill to swallow.”
But Welborn said it would satisfy the desire of the response team to move forward without interference, and it would allow the agency to take care of its own matters without involvement of the Governor’s Office.
In response, Molnar suggested Fielder should place herself on leave for policy errors.
Molnar said he couldn’t leave 200,000 people in his district without representation, and he wouldn’t silence their voices in a current rate case that’s under consideration.
He also said he does not believe he has hampered the investigation — and he doesn’t plan to do so in the future.
“I’m under a microscope now. Would I purposefully do something to impede an investigation?” he asked.
He said the letter to the governor is invalid without a public meeting and without four votes calling for suspension. Molnar also called on his fellow commissioners to follow the policies they were pressing him about.
“I’m tired of being vilified,” Molnar said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/600x200-PSC.jpg,,,2025-09-03 20:57:41.378228

(White House/Daniel Torok)President Donald Trump left his Alaska summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin without a deal for a cease-fire in Ukraine.
The summit did, however, leave the city of Anchorage with one tangible result: more than $200,000 in municipal expenses, largely on law enforcement workers, according to a spokeswoman for Mayor Suzanne LaFrance.
The spokeswoman, Emily Goodykoontz, said the city will seek reimbursement from the Trump administration. A White House spokeswoman referred questions to the U.S. Secret Service; a Secret Service spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, did not directly answer a question about whether it will agree to Anchorage’s request.
During Trump’s first term, the federal government reimbursed Palm Beach County some $40 million a year for protection the municipality provided the president while he was at his Mat-a-Lago estate. And in July, Palm Beach County officials said they would ask for payment out of a $300 million appropriation in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act dedicated to reimbursing local expenses for protecting any formally designated “residence of the president.”
But it’s not immediately clear whether that pot of money can be used to compensate the city of Anchorage, where Trump only briefly visited a military base for the summit.
Guglielmi said that conversations about reimbursement would remain “between the Secret Service and our local partners.”
Trump’s past visits to municipalities as a candidate, meanwhile, have resulted in an array of unpaid invoices sent to his campaign.
In Erie, Pa.; El Paso, Texas; Albuquerque, N.M.; Wildwood, N.J.; Missoula County, Mont.; and Mesa, Ariz., among other places, local governments have tried to compel Trump’s campaign committee to pay up — to no avail. Some have been waiting years for payment from the committee, or from the U.S. Secret Service.
The city of Green Bay, Wis., sent invoices related to local police, fire, public works, parks and traffic services across four appearances during 2024 by candidate Trump and vice presidential candidate JD Vance. Total bill: $56,204.
The Trump campaign, in May 2024, told the city that it “does not pay for policy or security-related invoices,” according to Green Bay spokesman Michael Bergman. The campaign referred the city’s requests to the Secret Service, which also hasn’t paid, he said.
“We have sent demand letters, phone calls, and made public statements,” Bergman said. “We have received no response.”
Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ 2024 campaign also has $1,822 in unpaid invoices from Green Bay.
In Spokane, Wash., local officials say they’ve simply given up on Trump, and other presidential candidates. The Trump campaign still has a $65,124 tab for police overtime costs stemming from a visit in 2016, while Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign owes $33,318 and Hillary Clinton’s campaign owes $2,793.
“While there are outstanding balances, we do not anticipate payment and are not actively pursuing collection efforts,” Spokane spokesperson Erin Hut told Northern Journal.
Since entering presidential politics in 2015, Trump, a Republican, has repeatedly touted his law-and-order bona fides, vowing to support police and “back the blue.” More recently, an April executive order Trump signed called for “empowering state and local law enforcement,” including increasing pay and benefits for officers.

In Anchorage, summit-related expenses in excess of $200,000 would be a “huge hit to the budget,” said Chris Constant, who chairs the city’s Assembly.
Yearly spending by the city exceeds $600 million, with more than $100 million for the police department alone. But Assembly members can still engage in prolonged debate over individual budget items of $100,000 or less.
“Twenty or 30 grand, I might feel okay with. Fifty grand, starting to get pretty real. But $200,000, that’s a real painful amount of money,” said Constant, a Democrat. “That is how many child care units of service? How many police responses is that to criminal activities happening in the city, or homeless camps?”
Guglielmi, the Secret Service spokesman, said Congress has not authorized his agency to issue reimbursements.
“State and local law enforcement play a crucial role in our ability to effectively safeguard the president and other Secret Service protectees,” he said in an email. “However, the U.S. Secret Service currently lacks a mechanism to reimburse local governments for their support during protective events.”
Constant said expenses for last month’s summit could have been much higher, but were limited because Trump and Putin did not leave the Anchorage military base that hosted the meeting.
Nonetheless, he said, city employees had to be prepared for duty that day, even if they were physically distant from the summit itself. He said he spoke with an Anchorage law enforcement worker who spent the day of the event on call while otherwise recruiting at the Alaska State Fair, far outside city limits.
“Her arm was in the car, ready to drive to town. Everybody was on and ready, right?” he said. “It’s not fair that the local government should have to cover the federal government’s bill. They don’t even have to balance their budget.”

During a Wednesday press conference, Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) told reporters that they’re “not getting anywhere” in negotiations with the Senate, continuing to criticize the upper chamber for their failure to present a road funding plan. 
While the budget proposal put forth by the House allocates $3.4 billion to road repairs, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer putting forth her road funding plan in February, the Senate is the sole negotiator left without a proposal for a new funding model. 
Transparency surrounding legislative spending directives, otherwise known as earmarks or pork projects, remained a key division between the chambers. While the House instituted rules requiring lawmakers to submit their funding requests for review, Hall argued the Senate wants to continue the status quo, not disclosing their earmarks until after the bill is signed. 
“I’m not going to sign up for another bill where we spend hundreds of millions of dollars that we don’t know what it is until way after the bill is signed, and then you guys tell us what they are months later and we find out it was all scandalous. Let’s disclose it now, like we did,” Hall told reporters.

In a statement posted to social media, Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) hit back on accusations that she has been the issue in budget negotiations.
“When you’re taking breakfast and lunch from kids to balance your budget, I’m going to have a problem with that. When you gut health care and supports for moms and babies, then yeah, I’m going to be a problem. When you’re cutting hundreds of police officers and services for crime victims, you better believe I’m going to cause a problem,” Brinks said. “That’s his plan. And I pledge to the people of Michigan that I will be a “problem” until Republicans start putting them first. I’m in your corner and I’m not going anywhere.”

While House Republicans’s school funding plan included an increase to per-pupil funding, Democrats and education advocates have spoken out against the proposal, as those classroom dollars would need to be used to fund other programs like free school lunches and at-risk programs.
During the press conference, Hall, alongside House Appropriations Committee Chair Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township) and Minority Vice Chair Matt Maddock (R-Milford), responded to several criticisms of their budget – including the reduction in funding for 300 full time employee positions within the state police – alleging that several state departments had overbudgeted for hiring, requesting state funds for hundreds of unfilled positions and retaining those funds.

When asked how many of these positions were open due to retirements or other temporary vacancies, the lawmakers could not immediately provide an answer. 
“It is very hard to get this information out of the departments. It’s very, very difficult. We do have regular reports that we get, but they don’t want to disclose the information,” Bollin said.
With a new fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1, lawmakers have until the end of the day on Tuesday, Sept. 20 to reach an agreement, pass a budget and avert a government shutdown.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Former Anchorage Mayor Dave Bronson has resigned as manager of Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport less than eight months after he was appointed to run the fourth-largest cargo airport in the world.
“Airport Manager Dave Bronson has announced his resignation from Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (ANC) for personal reasons, with September 2 as his final day of service. Departing in good standing, we appreciated Mr. Bronson’s contributions to ANC, and extend our best wishes as he begins his next chapter,” said Lex Yelverton, the airport’s communications and PR specialist. 
Yelverton said the airport’s division operations manager will work as the acting manager while the position is vacant.
Bronson did not immediately return a phone call or text message seeking comment on his resignation. He told the Anchorage Daily News that it was “time to move along” and “it’s hunting season.”
Bronson has occasionally been mentioned on social media as a possible candidate for governor in next year’s statewide elections.
Incumbent Gov. Mike Dunleavy is term-limited and cannot run for re-election in 2026. With a little over 11 months remaining before the primary election, 10 candidates have already filed documents indicating they intend to campaign for the office. Nine are Republicans.
The airport director’s job is a political appointment by the office of the governor, Yelverton said.
Bronson, a Republican, was elected Anchorage’s mayor in 2021, months after the incumbent Democratic mayor resigned during a sex scandal and amid a conservative backlash to COVID-19 prevention efforts by the city.
One of the leaders of that opposition movement, conservative activist Bernadette Wilson, has already declared her candidacy for governor.
During Bronson’s term as Anchorage mayor, he was accused by city employees, including some of his own hires, of mismanagement and unethical behavior.
Bronson ran for re-election in 2024 but was defeated by independent candidate and current Mayor Suzanne LaFrance. 
Dunleavy and U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan endorsed Bronson’s candidacy for re-election.
Before working as mayor, Bronson was a commercial airline pilot, an officer in the Alaska Air National Guard, and served in the U.S. Air Force. 
At the time of Bronson’s selection for the airport job, Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities Commissioner Ryan Anderson said Bronson’s “blend of hands-on aviation expertise and public sector experience is an asset to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport.”
The Ted Stevens airport, thanks to its location as a refueling stop on transpacific cargo flights, has been one of the busiest cargo airports in the world for almost a decade. 
In rankings published July 8 by the Airports Council International, it was the No. 4 cargo airport in the world and the second-busiest in the United States by cargo volume, with 3.7 million metric tons of cargo shipped, only slightly behind Memphis (3.75 million tons) and Shanghai (3.78 million tons). Hong Kong, with 4.9 million tons of cargo shipped, is the No. 1 cargo airport in the world.
The ACI statistics show Anchorage cargo traffic grew 9.4% from 2023 to 2024. 
That growth may have slowed — it predates the imposition of international tariffs by President Donald Trump and his administration’s decision to end the de minimis tariff exemption, which allowed packages worth less than $800 to be shipped to the United States without an import tax.
That exemption had applied to much of the cargo shipped through Ted Stevens, and its expiration could reduce cargo demand.

(Courtesy of Disney)A mother lies dead. A son on the run. Mysterious creatures in the Alaskan wilderness create a paranormal encounter for the suspected killer.
Derived from the best-selling Audible audiobook “Midnight Son,” by James Dommek Jr., a new documentary on Hulu premiers September 4,“Blood & Myth,” directed by Kahlil Hudson and executive produced by Dommek. The story follows Dommek’s investigation into a series of shocking violent crimes that shatter a remote Native village in Northern Alaska.
Dommek first learns about a string of bloody attacks, and the details don’t add up. At the center of the rampage is fugitive Teddy Kyle Smith, a fellow Iñupiaq man and successful actor who was admired within his tribe.
The mystery deepens when Smith is apprehended after making a run for it in the wild, and makes a shocking claim: while out in the wilderness, he had a frightening encounter with Iñukuns – sinister beings well-known and long-feared by the Iñupiaq people – and that they had guided his violent actions.
“The first thing he said after being captured was ‘They’re real!’” Dommek told ICT from Alaska. “He says he heard them and then they showed themselves to him.”
During a subsequent trial, Smith’s tale of Iñukuns fell on deaf ears. The truth of his actions doomed him to being convicted of attempted murder after he left his mother lying dead on the floor of her house, ran into the woods and shot two men in a cabin who both survived. His mother’s death was ruled inconclusive with no actual cause given. He claimed to have encountered the Iñukuns in the woods outside his tent.
Dommek knew the frightening stories of “the little people” – whose existence is accepted as fact by northern Native communities and supported by first-person accounts and chilling sightings.
Obsessed by the story, he takes a journey back to the village to uncover the truth behind what Smith allegedly saw in those mountains. Was it possible that those myths were true, or was it all a “theater of the mind” as he says?
“I’ve always been obsessed with Alaskan survival stories,” Dommek says. “There were so many things going on with the story, but the crime, the matricide, the violence, those were a part of the story, but it’s not the whole thing. It’s just many little strings that braid together to make a pretty strong rope.”
Dommek is eventually allowed to visit Smith in jail.
“He was guarded about tough questions in there. Smith wanted to do the interview with his side of the story. He’s exhausted his appeals, but he still has hope. He’s still working to get a sentence reduction; he didn’t want to incriminate himself.”
The documentary shows footage taken by a woman that had flown over the area and shows a few rocky villages along a river that no one knew were there or who lived there.
“I don’t know where it is exactly,” Dommek says. “The government put a restriction on the area. The president of our tribe can’t even go there and that’s our land. There’s a buffer of 10 miles; they’re calling it a sacred site. I heard they were going to send a team of archaeologists this past summer to go and check it out, but there were massive wildfires in the area that prevented them from going.”
Dommek says the villages look like a wintertime camp, except the homes are made out of rocks. The size of the doorways and windows are very tiny and would have been difficult for adult humans to get in and out of.
In the film, Smith claims he first heard the little people and then they showed themselves to him one night, and he knew that he couldn’t show any fear or they might harm him. They told him he was “weak” and “vulnerable,” words that scared him into violent action.
After hearing his claim, Dommek met Smith in prison. What was his take after meeting him in person?
“My take on meeting him in person was I don’t believe he has mental issues. He was a US Marine, and the Marines have a very extensive vetting process, including a lot of psychological tests. He’s incredibly sharp. He’s grounded. We asked everyone we interviewed, what do you think? Do they exist or not? Now they may not be mythical magical creatures, but I definitely think that there was a group of small people that lived out on the land, as recent as a couple decades ago, and may still be out there now.
“What I hope people take away from this is that number one, Native people are very good storytellers. And number two, there is still some mystery that exists in this world. The Western concept is that we know it all. In the Indigenous concept, especially northern Alaskan, we don’t know it all. It’s a big wild place. That’s what I hope people take away. I’m excited to introduce this new monster in the woods that most viewers will never have heard of.”
The film presents a spectrum of different images of what these beings could be and how malevolent or benevolent they might be. The filmmakers leave it up to the viewer to decide, what they are, what they could be, how much Teddy may have been influenced by these beings who he may have contacted.
“There’s also the other social justice side,” director Hudson says, “getting into the issue around the justice system in rural Alaska and how it’s failed Native communities for centuries. The Western justice system is not set up to serve rural Alaska villages. Something needs to be done, more work and awareness brought to light and how those failures are impacting Native communities.”
Based on the facts, myth aside, he was convicted of attempted murder. They sent his mother’s body to Anchorage and the coroner said her death is inconclusive. Perhaps she was scared to death or shocked, but it was enough to send her panicked son on the run.
“I was always under the assumption only guilty people run,” Dommek claims. “After talking with Ted, I came to a new conclusion that maybe he thought he did something to her so frightening that she died from the shock. This is all speculation. But he was given 99 years for the attempted murders, the strictest sentence an Alaskan can get. We don’t have the death penalty up here.
“I don’t know if too many other stories exist like this, where it’s an Indigenous true crime told through an Indigenous lens. I just hope that we did the story justice. I’ve been obsessed with this since I first heard it.”
Dommek says he did an audiobook first for a reason.
“I wanted to tap into Native storytelling and oral tradition and the ‘theater of the mind’ and using words and unveiling the facts more like a movie does. The audio book did really well, and here we are today talking about the documentary.”

(Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)An updated state protocol that New Mexico health officials hope will remove barriers for residents seeking COVID-19 vaccines will likely be effective by the end of the week.
State Health Secretary Gina DeBlassie signed a public health order on Aug. 29 directing the health department to work with the New Mexico Board of Pharmacy “to amend regulations to remove barriers and ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines at pharmacies across the state.”
The order followed reports of some “pharmacies announcing they cannot administer the vaccine in New Mexico unless recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an advisory group to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has yet to convene and act on the matter,” the health department said in a news release over the weekend.
NMDOH medical epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser told Source New Mexico on Wednesday that the updated protocol from the Pharmacy Board is expected to remove any of the barriers presented by the current federal guidelines.
Currently, he said, many of the vaccines administered in the state are done so through its pharmacies, which are governed by a protocol established by the Pharmacy Board and others that essentially requires the pharmacies to follow the ACIP guidelines in order to have “prescriptive authority” and give vaccines. Lacking the ACIP guidelines, Smelser noted, the pharmacies’ parent companies “have determined that they require a prescription in order to get a vaccine.”
The revised protocol, he said, addresses the situation.
“We anticipate that that will alleviate the problem,” he said, “however, we cannot control the decisions made by the parent companies of the pharmacies in New Mexico.”
New Mexico Regulation and Licensing Department Communications Director Andrea Brown confirmed to Source NM on Wednesday that the updated protocol from the Board of Pharmacy “is pending final approval and should be effective by the end of this week.”
Smelser said New Mexico has not received its full allotment of the COVID-19 vaccine, but health officials expect more to be available in the state in the next few weeks. He said residents can call the health department’s hotline, 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833-796-8773) for assistance finding or scheduling their COVID-19 vaccines.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recent approved the updated COVID-19 vaccine formulations, but added new restrictions. As noted in the new health order, under the new FDA order, people over the age of 65 are eligible, but younger people require an underlying medical issue for eligibility. Smelser said he believes a large number of residents “will meet the criteria” and be able to access vaccines once the new protocol is in place and more of the allotment has arrived.
“New Mexico Department of Health believes that these are safe and effective vaccines for prevention spread in our communities, as well as to prevent severe outcomes like hospitalizations of death,” Smelser said. “So our main objective is to be able to get the vaccines out in an efficient manner to those who need it in our state.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/COVID-vaccine.jpg,,,2025-09-03 19:57:05.089031

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Department of Natural Resources’ amendments to an Ottumwa coal plant’s water discharge permit have stirred controversy among environmental groups in Iowa, who allege the permit allows the station to avoid federal regulations on leachate discharges. 
Despite DNR promises that the Ottumwa Generating Station does not discharge leachate, water that has interacted with the waste products associated with burning coal, the discharge of leachate occupied most of the conversation at the Wednesday public hearing for the permit. 
Wendy Hieb, DNR’s coordinator for industrial wastewater permitting, said at the hearing that the amendment adjusted discharge limits at a wastewater outfall that was new when the Ottumwa Generating Station’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, NPDES, permit was last renewed. 
Hieb said the amendment makes use of data collected from the new outfall over the past year as it has been in use. 
“I want to be very clear what it does not do: Landfill leachate is not discharged via this NPDES permit, nor are we proposing to do so,” Hieb said.

In July, environmental groups including the Iowa Environmental Council, Sierra Club and Environmental Law & Policy Center submitted comments on DNR’s draft permit amendment, alleging the permit “unlawfully” avoided federal guidelines for leachate discharges. 
DNR staff and an Alliant Energy spokesperson said at the time that the permit draft “incorrectly” included mention of leachate discharge. 
Hieb reiterated that DNR made a mistake in including mention of leachate in the draft permit for the Ottumwa Generating Station, which is owned by Interstate Power and Light Company, a subsidiary of Alliant Energy. 
A spokesperson for Alliant Energy said at the time that the Ottumwa Generating Station “does not produce leachate and the plant is not allowed to discharge leachate from any landfill under its permit.” 
Leachate, which collects between the bottom of a coal ash landfill and the lining of the landfill, is pumped out. According to DNR, IPL, which also operates the nearby Ottumwa Midland Landfill to process the coal ash generated from the station, now transports its leachate from the landfill to either be used and evaporated at the generating station, or to be treated at the Ottumwa Water Pollution Control Facility. 
Hieb said this change was made to come into compliance with the latest effluent limitation guidelines set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. She said these guidelines also change with almost every administration, making it “no small effort to keep up” and ensure permits are current. 
Per the same guidelines, Hieb said the landfill has to cease discharging to the municipal water treatment facility by 2027. 
Raihan Rashidi with the Iowa Environmental Council said in public comments that the permit “cannot delay action.”
“Communities and surrounding ecosystems deserve protection,” Rashidi said.
Michael Schmidt, general counsel for the Iowa Environmental Council, also spoke in public comments and said the federal regulations require “action as soon as possible” to ensure coal burning facilities are compliant. 
“These discharges of heavy metals should be a concern to everyone in the area, and we encourage DNR to impose compliance requirements rather than avoiding the issue,” Schmidt said. 
Leachate and groundwater
The public hearing was requested by the environmental groups in their comments on the permit. Since then, more written comments have been sent to DNR about the permit.
Hieb said most of the submitted public comments on the permit have “not been germane” to the limit guidelines but have been about leachate and “underdrain” water, another type of water that can become polluted in a coal-ash landfill system. 
Underdrain water, or the water that seeps past the coal-ash landfill and is pumped out of the ground, was the subject of a notice of intent to sue from environmental groups to Interstate Power and Light. The notice alleged IPL was discharging this water, without the proper permit, into a wetland that flowed into the Des Moines River. 
Hieb said IPL is working to secure a different type permit system to address the underdrain, which she said cannot be covered by Iowa’s stormwater permits. 
Brian Rath, an environmental engineer senior who leads the solid waste and contaminated site section for DNR, further explained that the department has a process to determine if the underdrain water has been impacted by the coal residue, by comparing it to groundwater at an upgradient, opposite to the flow of groundwater, site. 
If the underdrain has higher levels of heavy metals, like arsenic and boron, than what is measured in groundwater at the upgradient site, then that water must be collected and treated the same as leachate. 
But, Rath said when the groundwater underdrain at the landfill is compared to up-system groundwater levels, they have “not shown that they are impacted by the landfill.” 
“Instead, they are exhibiting similar characteristics to that upgradient groundwater,” Rath said. “Therefore, there is no discharge of unmanaged leachate coming from the Ottumwa Midland landfill, through the groundwater, underdrain system, or otherwise.” 
In addition to interested environmental groups, members of the public, some Ottumwa residents, attended the virtual hearing and voiced concerns about living downstream of the plant and the impacts it might have on their health. 
One Ottumwa resident said “we’re just really getting tired of corporations not being held accountable.” 
Josh Mandelbaum, an attorney with the Environmental Law & Policy Center, also called for greater transparency from the plant, per the EPA’s effluent guidelines, often referred to as ELG rules. 
“This permit fails to meet the transparency requirements of the ELG rule,” Mandelbaum said. “The public deserves to know what’s in our water and what is being done to address this pollution.”
Terry Langan, the co-president of the Nishnabotna Water Defenders Board, said the DNR needed to “uphold the public trust.” 
“Stop allowing these industries to export their externalities to downstream,” Langan said at the hearing. 
DNR’s responses to public comment and questions asked Wednesday will appear on the department’s website once filed.

How the settlement will benefit students,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/09/la-unified/,"The settlement affects about 250,000 students, who will get access to one-on-one tutoring and other services.","In summary
The settlement affects about 250,000 students, who will get access to one-on-one tutoring and other services. 


More than 250,000 students in Los Angeles Unified will be eligible for extra tutoring, summer school and other academic help after the district settled a class-action lawsuit alleging that its remote learning practices during the pandemic were discriminatory.
The settlement, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, was announced Wednesday by the law firm representing families who said their children fell disastrously behind during the Covid-related school shutdown in 2020-21.
“After five years of tireless advocacy on behalf of LAUSD students and families, we are proud to have secured a historic settlement that ensures students receive the resources they need to thrive,” said Edward Hillenbrand, a partner at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. “This critical support will help pave the way for lasting educational equity.”
Los Angeles Unified had no comment on the case because the settlement has yet to be approved by the court. A hearing is set for December, although the settlement goes into effect immediately.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Los Angeles and nearly every other school district in California closed for in-person learning from March 2020 through fall 2021. Students attended classes virtually, and most fell behind academically. Test scores statewide plummeted after schools reopened. Chronic absenteeism soared.
In fall 2020, a group of families whose children were languishing during remote learning sued Los Angeles Unified, saying the district wasn’t doing enough to ensure students were receiving an adequate education.
One parent, Akela Wroten Jr., said that his second-grade daughter was behind before the pandemic and became even more lost during remote learning. She struggled with reading and never got the extra attention she needed because teachers weren’t assessing her progress. 
Another parent, Vicenta Martinez, said her daughter didn’t get any instruction in spring 2020, in part because she never received logon information for remote instruction and the school never followed up. When she finally did access remote classes, the lessons were short and teachers offered little feedback.
“LAUSD’s remote learning plan fails to provide students with even a basic education and is not preparing them to succeed,” the lawsuit alleged.
The suit singled out an agreement between the district and its teachers union that said teachers would only be required to work four hours a day, wouldn’t have to give tests and weren’t required to deliver live lessons — their lessons could be asynchronous, or recorded beforehand. In addition, the agreement said the district wouldn’t evaluate or monitor teachers during that time.
United Teachers Los Angeles did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The plaintiffs argued that the district’s policies discriminated against low-income, Black, Latino, disabled and English learner students, because those were the students least likely to have adequate support to succeed in remote learning. Those student groups also comprise the vast majority of students in the district, the nation’s second-largest.
The settlement requires the district to offer a host of academic support, including summer school and after-school tutoring, to the 250,000 students who were enrolled in L.A. Unified during the pandemic and are still with the district. Among those students, 100,000 who are performing below grade level will be eligible for 45 hours of one-on-one tutoring every year through 2028.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/081820_LAUSD-COVID_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-03 19:57:05.089031

Officials gathered in a lot located in Las Cruces’ East Mesa at the northeastern reaches of the city, where new residential construction is largely focused. The housing project will include 52 single-family homes in the Arcadia subdivision, Natalie Green, housing and neighborhood revitalization administrator for the city, told Source New Mexico.
Green explained that the Arcadia neighborhood has been many years in the making and is part of the city’s master plan. She said the next development is Mesa Vista and areas will again be set aside for affordable homes, but construction is still years away.
“We’re planning well in advance,” Green said. “We just want to emphasize, especially for Arcadia, that it’s single family homeownership. It’s for those first-time home buyers, for some of our families who are just currently priced out of the market, whether it be because of escalating costs or interest rates, and so we’ve developed a program to just help get families into single family housing.”
The program is a partnership between the City of Las Cruces and Tierra Del Sol Housing Corporation, which works to help people attain housing.
The Arcadia project received $3.25 million in state funding, according to a news release from the city. Las Cruces and Doña Ana County received a total of $11 million of the state’s $120 million affordable housing and homelessness allocation in House Bill 2 during the most recent legislative session.
The other projects include more single-family home neighborhoods, multifamily rental housing, senior housing, transitional housing and the Landlord Risk Mitigation Program – a partnership between the city and Mesilla Valley Community of Hope, a nonprofit organization that provides various assistance to unhoused people.
“There is a vision for what this community wants to look like, and how you want to build, how you want to support the families who are from here, how you want to accommodate new growth, and how you want to…support all different income levels of family,” New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions Sec. Sarita Nair said during the groundbreaking. “And that was really, again, unique in the state and it made it easy to make the choices to make these investments here.”
Rep. Nathan Small (D-Las Cruces), chair of the House Appropriations and Finance Committee, said the work of the committee during the most recent legislative session was focused on supporting investments that make life easier for New Mexicans.
“I am absolutely dedicated to making sure that we have first-class infrastructure, investment and support across every area, so that we have jobs, and you see fewer help wanted signs,” Small said during the groundbreaking. “That’s going to drive down costs for all of us and make life affordable, so that we have a wide range of places for folks to live. And you know what that does? That makes it more affordable for all of us to live in this incredible community, even as it continues to grow.”

(Photo by Alex Wroblewski-Pool/Getty Images)Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance visited Annunciation Catholic school and church Wednesday afternoon, one week after a shooter opened fire on the school’s first Mass of the year, killing two and injuring 21. 
The Vances also visited 10-year-old Lydia Kaiser, who was critically injured in the shooting, at Children’s Minnesota in Minneapolis. 
Kaiser was shot while protecting her younger “buddy,” according to the family’s GoFundMe. Her father, Harry Kaiser, is a gym teacher at Annunciation who was also in attendance at Mass; he stayed with students, reuniting families, while his daughter was rushed to the hospital. 
In a press conference Wednesday afternoon at Children’s, Harry Kaiser read aloud the message that he shared with Vance during the visit:
“Will you please promise me, as a father and a Catholic, that you will earnestly support the study of our culture, that we are the country that has the worst mass shooter problem? … Will you please promise to pursue, despite powerful lobbies, some commonsense, bipartisan legislation as a starting point, so we can come out of our corners and find the values that we share, so that this time, progress is made?”
Speaking with the press before boarding his flight back to D.C., Vance said he’s “never had a day that will stay with me like this day did.” He asked the public for prayers for one child victim of the shooting who is still in critical condition — 12-year-old Sophia Forchas — and said he would honor the families affected by the shooting by hugging his children and saying he loves them.

Asked about Gov. Tim Walz’s plan to call a special session of the Minnesota Legislature to address mass shootings, Vance said he won’t tell Minnesota leaders how to respond.
“I think that there’s a strong desire from across the political spectrum to do something so that these shootings are less common. I think that it’s important that they actually take steps that are favorable, that are going to work,” Vance said. 
Leah Kaiser, the mother of Lydia, referenced a proverb — quoted by Annunciation Principal Matthew DeBoer shortly after the shooting — that goes, “When you pray, move your feet.”
“Vice President Vance, you have enormous authority. Please, use this moment to move your feet and transcend our political divides to promote peace, and unity, and hope,” Leah Kaiser said. 
On the sidewalk outside of Annunciation, someone wrote the prayer of St. Francis — the same prayer House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, who was assassinated earlier this summer, carried in her wallet: 
Lord, make me an instrument of your peace:
where there is hatred, let me sow love;
where there is injury, pardon;
where there is doubt, faith;
where there is despair, hope;
where there is darkness, light;
where there is sadness, joy.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2232910370-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-03 19:57:05.089031

However, DHS said the designation will end in 60 days after the notice is published in the Federal Register. Initially, Venezuelans with TPS were granted protections until October 2026 under the Biden administration, but Noem revoked that extension.DHS is currently being sued over Noem’s decision to revoke the extension granted under the Biden administration for TPS for two groups of Venezuelans, people who arrived in 2021 and those who arrived in 2023. DHS has already terminated TPS for 350,000 Venezuelans who arrived in 2023, which is still being challenged in courts. “Given Venezuela’s substantial role in driving irregular migration and the clear magnet effect created by Temporary Protected Status, maintaining or expanding TPS for Venezuelan nationals directly undermines the Trump Administration’s efforts to secure our southern border and manage migration effectively,” a DHS spokesperson said in a statement. During the last day of President Donald Trump's first term, he granted deportation protections for that group of Venezuelans who arrived in the U.S. before Jan. 20, 2021, citing unstable conditions with the country’s government. “The deteriorative condition within Venezuela, which presents an ongoing national security threat to the safety and well-being of the American people, warrants the deferral of the removal of Venezuelan nationals who are present in the United States,” according to Trump’s 2021 proclamation. After that designation, under the Biden administration in March 2021, then-Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas created a TPS designation for Venezuelans who entered the U.S. before March 9, 2021.Mayorkas created a second TPS designation, for another group of Venezuelans who arrived in 2023, about 350,000. TPS is designated when a country is deemed too dangerous for return, due to violence or a major disaster. A national from a country under the TPS designation has to go through vetting and is granted work permits and deportation protections for up to 18 months before having their TPS renewed.",,,,2025-09-03 19:57:05.089031

“It's a once-in-a-generation investment that's going to shape our communities for decades,” said Christa Shute, executive director of NEK Broadband.

Vermont is moving closer to universal broadband internet access, officials say, as the state’s Community Broadband Board released a proposal last week to allocate nearly $180 million in federal, state and private funds for broadband infrastructure projects. 
The bulk of the funds have been made available to Vermont through the federal Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment, or BEAD, program. If the proposal is accepted by the federal government, rates of access to broadband internet will rise to 99% statewide through these grants, according to Community Broadband Board Executive Director Christine Hallquist.
The board, which was formed in 2021 to advance broadband access in the state, has faced a number of challenges in crafting the proposal, including bureaucratic delays and the high inherent costs of rural broadband construction. But local leaders say the infrastructure this funding will provide — if approved by the federal government — will have far-reaching benefits for rural communities across the state, and particularly in the Northeast Kingdom.
The timeline for greenlighting BEAD funding has been complicated. 
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration under President Donald Trump changed its requirements for state proposals in June, giving states just 90 days to submit revised materials. Vermont’s broadband board made its proposal available for public comment starting last week, and the federal deadline for submission is Thursday. 
The board’s plan seeks to use about $119 million in federal BEAD funding to deploy infrastructure — just over half what the state was originally allocated by the program in 2023. There has been no guidance from the Trump administration about how or if the state will be allowed to use the remaining funds.
A spokesperson for the Vermont Community Broadband Board said the state will also submit a proposal for related non-infrastructure projects to the same funding source Thursday, but that its contents remained confidential until then.
Among the telecommunications administration’s June rule changes was new language about how states should weigh different technologies, including a reclassification of low Earth orbit satellite internet as a potentially equivalent alternative to fiber optic. 
In the wake of that policy change, Elon Musk’s company SpaceX applied for its Starlink service to be the provider for essentially every Vermont address that the federal grants were intended to cover, according to Hallquist.
But Hallquist said the technology simply doesn’t work very well for many places in Vermont when you account for factors like foliage cover and the state’s irregular, mountainous landscape.
“We did an extensive engineering analysis,” Hallquist said, to which SpaceX “didn’t even respond properly.”

“We defined them as a non-priority technology,” Hallquist said of providers like SpaceX. The state will use low Earth orbit satellites only where the cost for ground technology exceeds $17,000 for a single location.
Fiber-optic internet is the clear focus of the board’s proposal, accounting for roughly 90% of the nearly 15,000 BEAD locations covered by the grant. Satellites will cover less than 7% of locations.
SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment.
The new rules also placed a greater emphasis on finding lowest-cost solutions for broadband services, and eliminating what the new administration views as unnecessary regulatory measures surrounding issues like climate awareness and equitable hiring practices.
In an ideal world, Hallquist said, broadband internet would be guaranteed to all residents, regardless of price, but that she saw the logic of cost-cutting by transferring a small number of marginal, expensive sites in rural areas to satellite coverage. In talks with providers, the board was also able to reach lower cost agreements this summer than in previous negotiations.
Environmental impact and fair employment are not significant worries, according to Hallquist. Providers will still have to meet statutory environmental requirements, and Vermont employers meet high fair-practice requirements anyway, she said.

‘A once-in-a-generation investment’
The Community Broadband Board has made NEK Community Broadband the largest provisional grant recipient in the proposal by far, with an allocation of over $93 million. The Northeast Kingdom provider, which is run as a communications union district (a municipal body formed to advance local internet infrastructure), serves 72 towns in the region.
Christa Shute, executive director of NEK Broadband, said her organization’s service area includes more than half of the state’s eligible households underserved by internet. The funding would help build over a thousand miles of fiber optic infrastructure, reaching nearly 10,000 addresses, she said.
Shute’s optimism is cautious — she’s aware the proposal still needs to be accepted at the federal level. 
Hallquist said the board was confident enough in the proposal getting federal approval that it would be appropriate for some providers to begin construction at their own risk. Shute intends to stop short of that, but said her team will begin the permitting and design work that must come before construction begins.
“It’s a once-in-a-generation investment that’s going to shape our communities for decades,” Shute said. “It will put individuals (in the NEK) on an equal playing ground for the opportunity to join the rest of the world.”
Heather Alger,  the head of economic access programs at Northeast Kingdom Community Action, said she views internet access as a necessity for full participation in society. It’s necessary not just for social connectedness, but for health care, civic engagement and social services. 
“Individuals here are left behind because they don’t have access,” Alger said. “We need to get infrastructure into the Northeast Kingdom.”
NEK Broadband offers reduced rates and free installation for qualifying low-income customers, which Alger has seen make a “tremendous impact” for her clients.

Ellie de Villiers, president of the Vermont Communications Union District Association and executive director of Maple Broadband, another provisional BEAD recipient, said she was glad the majority of the contracts had gone to district companies laying terrestrial technology.
The cost-driven language of the new telecommunications administration rules had made de Villiers worried that smaller or publicly owned companies wouldn’t be able to compete with larger for-profit corporations, she said. De Villiers called the level of resourcing that will potentially be gained by Vermont communications union districts “very good news.”
Several private companies have also been provisionally allocated grants, including Consolidated Communications and Comcast.
“We recognize how important it is for Vermonters to have access to affordable, reliable broadband … we have a strong track record of working closely with Vermont’s Communications Union Districts (CUDs) to deliver future-ready fiber to unserved and underserved communities,” wrote a spokesperson for Consolidated Communications in a statement to VTDigger on Wednesday. “Our goal is to expand choice, not limit it.”
Shute also emphasized the possible cultural impacts of the investment. 
“We all talk about health and we talk about business,” she said, “but just being able to connect with people is also really important.”

(Photo by Piper Hutchinson/Louisiana Illuminator) ANGOLA – A section of the Louisiana State Penitentiary undergoing emergency repairs is being used to house Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees, Gov. Jeff Landry and officials with the Trump administration announced Wednesday.   
Landry said the facility “will house the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens arrested by ICE.”
A complex at the state prison is already being used to house 51 detainees and has a total capacity of 416. 
Joining Landry at the prison to make the announcement were U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheehan, who previously served as Landry’s Wildlife and Fisheries secretary. 
“Louisiana, you’re going to be an example for the rest of this country,” Bondi said. 
Landry declared a state emergency in late July to allow the expedited repair of Camp J at Angola. The four-building complex had been closed since 2018, with its only use as a quarantine site during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Neither the governor nor Noem shared whether the facility will be used as a post-conviction facility or as another ICE detention center where detainees await charges or trial. 
The detainees will join more than 4,000 inmates at Louisiana State Penitentiary, which stands on the site of a former slave plantation that is still a working farm now staffed with prisoners.  
Workers on the prison’s “farm line,” who pick vegetables that help feed the prisoners, are currently suing the state, alleging dangerous working conditions. Inmates at Angola can earn a maximum of $8 a week, regardless of the type of work they do. 
Landry touted Angola’s natural features, including “forests full of bears” and “swamps full of alligators” as among the new facility’s safety features. 
The Camp J section of the prison where ICE detainees are being held was once known as the “Dungeon.” It was designated as solitary confinement to segregate prisoners for disciplinary reasons. Prison officials closed it seven years ago after its cell locks malfunctioned, allowing inmates to evade security checks. Dozens of weapons were discovered after its closure, and more than 80 prison employees quit, retired or were fired related to misconduct at Camp J. 
Though it was rumored Camp J would be renamed Camp 47 to honor President Donald Trump, it has instead been renamed Camp 57 in honor of Landry, the 57th governor of Louisiana. 
The governor also referred to the facility as “Louisiana Lockup,” a title that was featured prominently on an oversized licensed plate that adorned the lectern he, Bondi and Noem used at a news conference in front of the facility.  
Landry’s emergency order in late July suspended state procurement code and public bid law to allow the officials to secure any materials and write or amend any contracts needed to respond to the emergency. 
Despite being asked by reporters multiple times, Landry would not disclose how much money the state spent on renovations or operations or whether the federal government would reimburse the state for any of its costs. 
Sheehan said the facility has been brought up to ICE standards, and detainees will have access to attorneys and a law library. 
Aside from its state penitentiary, Louisiana has become a go-to location for the Trump administration since it placed a heightened emphasis on immigration enforcement in January. The state’s nine ICE processing and detentions centers have a combined capacity of 6,000 people, second only to Texas with more than 28,000.
Louisiana State Penitentiary has room to hold more than 6,000 incarcerated people. Its population was 4,253 as of June 30, according to the most recent statistics from the Louisiana Department of Corrections and Public Safety. 
Immigrant rights advocates say the Louisiana ICE facilities have been full for several months because Bondi and the U.S. Department of Justice consider federal courts in the South to be more friendly venues for its immigration cases. 
According to data analysis from the Deportation Data Project, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested 1,989 people in Louisiana from when Trump returned to office Jan. 20 through June 26. More than half of those arrestees have since been deported or removed from the United States.
The analysis also found that just 6% of ICE arrests in Louisiana over the period were convicted violent criminals.        
Critics of the Trump administration’s approach to immigration have called on federal courts to uphold the U.S. Constitution’s requirement of due process for persons who are arrested. They note the vast majority of immigrant detainees have not been allowed to post bail while awaiting trial and are therefore unable to build their defense and secure witnesses.

(Photo by Paige Eichkorn for Arkansas Advocate)A Central Arkansas judge said Wednesday that he expects to rule “fairly quickly” on the legal challenge to a 2023 Arkansas law that increased the prerequisites for a citizen-initiated ballot measure to go before voters.
Pulaski County Circuit Judge Shawn Johnson heard arguments from attorney David Couch, representing the plaintiff League of Women Voters of Arkansas, and from Justin Brascher of the Arkansas Attorney General’s office, representing Secretary of State Cole Jester.
Act 236 of 2023 increased the number of counties where ballot initiative groups must gather signatures from 15 to 50. The League of Women Voters has supported multiple citizen-led ballot initiatives in the past few years, including a current effort to put proposed direct democracy protections on the 2026 ballot, and asked the court to enjoin Act 236.
Direct democracy is the process by which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and place them on the ballot for a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Couch said Wednesday that Act 236 interferes with petitioners’ ability to collect signatures, especially because compiling petitions for submission to the Secretary of State is a multi-step process.
The state Constitution’s Article 5, Section 1 put forth the 15-county minimum for signatures on petitions for ballot measures. Couch argued that Act 236 violated this section’s “unwarranted restrictions” provision, which states, “No law shall be passed to prohibit any person or persons from giving or receiving compensation for circulating petitions, nor to prohibit the circulation of petitions, nor in any manner interfering with the freedom of the people in procuring petitions.”
Another provision of the same section states, “No legislation shall be enacted to restrict, hamper or impair the exercise of the rights herein reserved to the people.” Couch said this supports the plaintiff’s case.

The constitutional question in the case is whether the Legislature can change a portion of the state Constitution by passing a law, Couch said. Brascher argued in response that Act 236 does not violate or amend the state Constitution but instead “works within the confines of Article 5, Section 1.”
“The Constitution says you’ve got to have at least 15 [counties], and that’s a floor from which the General Assembly can make a decision going up,” Brascher said.
He also argued that the case should be dismissed because of sovereign immunity, the principle that the state cannot be sued in its own courts.
The higher threshold for secretary of state approval did not stop reproductive rights advocates from collecting more than 102,000 signatures in 53 counties in an attempt to put a proposed limited right to abortion on the November 2024 ballot. Citizen-led constitutional amendments require 90,704 signatures.
The proposed abortion amendment did not end up on the ballot after then-Secretary of State John Thurston’s office disqualified more than 14,000 signatures on a technicality and the state Supreme Court upheld his decision.
Thurston was the initial defendant in the current case, but Jester was appointed secretary of state after Thurston was elected treasurer last year.
Ballot coalitions request preliminary injunction in Arkansas direct democracy lawsuit

Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest, was a plaintiff in the suit when it was first filed. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Herbert Wright ruled last year that King did not have standing to bring the complaint and dismissed him as a plaintiff. The case was assigned to Johnson after Wright was elected to Little Rock District Court.
Couch said after the hearing that he is confident the plaintiffs will prevail in the case.
He is also representing the League of Women Voters in their federal court challenge against a slate of new laws passed this year placing more requirements on direct democracy efforts. Two ballot question committees asked the court in July to temporarily block the six challenged laws. A hearing in the case has been scheduled for Sept. 30 in Fayetteville.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Two Kentucky Republicans are playing conflicting roles in a drama that threatens to divide President Donald Trump’s political base.
U.S. Reps. Thomas Massie and James Comer are central players in the controversy over releasing investigative files in the case of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Massie, who had already gained Trump’s ire, is leading a crusade to force a House vote on the full release of the Epstein documents by the Department of Justice (DOJ).
House Republican leaders oppose Massie’s move and are hoping an investigation by Comer’s committee will satisfy Republican demands for more transparency on the Epstein investigation and prosecution. 
Epstein’s death in federal custody in 2019 was ruled a suicide, although many Trump supporters have speculated that he was murdered to keep him from revealing embarrassing information about prominent people. Trump fueled speculation about Epstein’s death during his 2020 campaign. In 2024, Trump said he would declassify the Epstein records if returned to the presidency.
Massie appeared Wednesday with accusers of Epstein and U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., in a news conference outside the U.S. Capitol. 
Massie has filed a discharge petition that needs 218 signatures, or half the House, to force a vote on a records release that the Trump administration has resisted. If all Democrats sign the petition, it would need six Republicans to succeed. Only four Republicans, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, had signed by Wednesday afternoon, two short.
On Wednesday, Trump said calls for the full release of Epstein files are “a Democrat hoax that never ends.” The president has previously vowed to recruit a Republican opponent for Massie in next year’s primary election. The two clashed this summer over Trump’s bombing of Iran and Massie’s vote against the GOP megabill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

House Republican leaders are hoping to dissuade congressional Republicans from signing Massie’s discharge petition, instead supporting an investigation by the House Oversight committee, led by Kentucky Republican Comer. 
Comer’s committee on Tuesday released more than 30,000 pages of records from the investigation of Epstein, although the top Democrat on the committee said most of the information in the records had already become public.
The Oversight Committee also heard what Comer called “heartbreaking” stories from the survivors of Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted and is in prison. He is pressing for a House resolution that directs the Oversight Committee to continue its investigation.
“The Committee is working at an unprecedented pace and doing the work as it is supposed to be done,” Comer told the House Rules Committee. “What we heard today is that these survivors support these efforts and support transparency and accountability — goals we all share. This resolution furthers those goals. It supports our work. It supports the release of documents. And most importantly, it achieves what the survivors want. There is no question that Epstein and Maxwell were terrible criminals.”
Massie said he appreciated Comer’s efforts, but said he still had concerns about redaction of information within the documents and that some documents were already publicly available. 
“They may find some information, but they’re allowing the DOJ to curate all of the information that the DOJ is giving them,” Massie said outside the Capitol. 
At least one GOP candidate vying to replace outgoing U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell is standing with Trump. 
Nate Morris, a Lexington businessman who is a staunch opponent of McConnell, said after a Tuesday night town hall that Republicans in Washington “don’t need distractions.” 
“We’ve got a finite amount of time. We don’t need distractions. We don’t need people deviating from the president’s agenda,” Morris said. “We’ve got a once in a generation opportunity when we’ve got the Congress, we’ve got the executive office. We’ve got to move quickly to continue the push for the America First agenda, and we don’t need any distractions.”
A pro-Trump super PAC has been running anti-Massie ads in Kentucky in keeping with Trump’s vow to unseat the incumbent.
One rumored candidate for the president is state Sen. Aaron Reed, a Shelbyville Republican elected to the state legislature last year. Ahead of the Kentucky Farm Bureau Country Ham Breakfast in August, Reed told reporters that he is “happy being a senator right now” and is preparing for the 2026 legislative session.
“It’s a great honor to be a senator, and it’s also an honor to be considered, by some, to possibly be a congressman,” Reed said when asked about the rumors. “That wasn’t my focus. It’s not my focus today, but if God’s will is to do that, it’s kind of hard to fight that.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/massiesept32025-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-03 19:57:05.089031
,DC,2025-09-03 23:06:18+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Immigration groups ask appeals panel to reinstate refugee programs,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/immigration-groups-ask-appeals-panel-reinstate-refugee-programs,,"WASHINGTON — Immigration attorneys asked a federal appeals court Wednesday to restore two injunctions against the Trump administration's move to suspend refugee processing and to reinstate funding for refugee resettlement.Attorneys from the International Refugee Assistance Project pushed for three judges on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to lift a stay the court issued earlier this year that narrowed a ruling from a district court judge in Washington state. That stay allowed the Trump administration to continue blocking refugees, but said the processing for individuals conditionally approved for refugee status must continue, despite a more favorable ruling for the immigration groups at the district court level.Earlier this year, a district court in Seattle issued two preliminary injunctions, one to block the Trump administration from ending the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and another to resume funding to refugee assistance organizations. The judge found the president exceeded his authority in trying to end a program established by Congress.Melissa Keaney, a senior IRAP attorney, said during Wednesday’s oral arguments that failing to restore the program and funding would upend the half-century-old legal framework for refugee resettlement and those it is meant to serve.“What is at stake are the lives of thousands of refugees for whom Congress devised a careful plan for their effective resettlement that's been in place for 50 years,” Keaney said.Day 1 executive order dismantled refugee programThe suit challenges President Donald Trump’s January executive order that suspended all refugee admission and processing, as well as funding for organizations that handle resettlement in the United States. Three groups that had their cooperative resettlement agreements with the State Department terminated are plaintiffs in the suit — Church World Service, Lutheran Community Services Northwest and the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, or HIAS.“With one stroke of his pen, the president has elected to dismantle it all, causing overwhelming and irreparable harm to refugees stranded abroad, their families who are awaiting reunification, and the states and localities that have planned for their arrival,” Keaney said.Arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, Justice Department attorney Tiberius Davis said the Refugee Act allows the president to set caps on refugees and to determine who is allowed to be admitted into the country.“The president here made a finding that it was against the national interest because of the unprecedented surge of migration over the last four years, and because of the burden that placed on localities and on taxpayer funds,” Davis said.The panel of three judges that heard oral arguments were Kenneth Kiyul Lee, Jay S. Bybee and Richard R. Clifton. Former President George W. Bush nominated Bybee and Clifton. Trump nominated Lee. 128,000 refugees waiting to enterThe judges questioned the indefinite nature of the proclamation, which allows the president to make a determination every 90 days whether to continue suspending refugees' admissions.“If we don't know when the proclamation will end, what's the justification for stopping the processing for people who, … at least in theory, in six months, the door may be opened again, but since nobody has been processed, nobody will actually be standing in line,” Clifton said. Davis said that 128,000 refugees have been processed and would be waiting to enter the U.S.Clifton asked why processing of refugees should be stopped completely. Davis said the State Department doesn’t believe it’s efficient to “start processing a bunch of people who won't have any chance of getting in until the president determines that.”Bybee said processing refugees is different than allowing them to enter the U.S.“The (executive order) covers admission, it doesn't cover processing or applications,” Bybee said. “The Refugee Act provides a very, very detailed set of instructions about how we designate refugees and how we ultimately admit them.”Davis said that “if you can't get admitted, there's not really much of a remedy.” Refugee resettlement servicesDavis gave a similar answer about why resettlement services for refugees were suspended, saying the State Department suspended them because “it didn't make sense to continue providing funds when no new refugees would be admitted.”Lee asked if there are refugees admitted into the U.S. who would be eligible for resettlement services. Davis said some of the lead plaintiffs in Wednesday’s suit have gotten services and that the cancellation of grants was for future services. “A lot of the money has already gone out throughout the year, and the government has committed to paying for any work that's already been done,” Davis said. “It's just terminated individual grants going forward.”Lee asked if those resettlement funds were mandatory under a federal law authorizing funding for refugee services, but Davis said the Trump administration’s reading of the statute is that the funds are discretionary. “So you say, ‘You got into the United States, good luck?’” Bybee asked. Davis said the secretary of State has the authority to make that determination.Clifton pushed back and said the statue says the federal government “shall” provide refugee resettlement services.“We've got a congressional act which says this is what the government should do,” Clifton said. “Where does that give the government discretion to decide we don't want to do it anyway?”Order subverted law, immigration attorney saysLinda Evarts, senior IRAP attorney said Trump’s executive order overrode Congress’ authority, which created the refugee program. She added that by suspending refugee services the executive order also violates the Refugee Act because the law entitles qualified refugees to certain resettlement services such as job training.“The act has two main objectives,” Evarts said. “One: To provide a permanent and systematic procedure for admitting refugees of special humanitarian concern to the United States. And two: To provide comprehensive and uniform provisions for the effective resettlement of those admitted refugees.”Bybee asked if Congress allows the president to set caps on the number of refugees admitted in a year, why Trump couldn’t set the cap at zero.Evarts answered that would effectively kill the program Congress created.“That would be directly contrary to Congress's system, to have a permanent and systematic way for admitting refugees into this country and providing for them once here,” Evarts said.",,,,2025-09-03 19:57:05.089031

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — Freedom’s Frontier has received the half-million dollars the federal government held hostage for six months, ensuring the organization can continue for another year to preserve the story of the struggle for freedom through historic sites across Kansas and Missouri.
Freedom’s Frontier is among 62 National Heritage Areas that recognize historic, cultural and natural resources, with an emphasis on preservation, recreation, tourism and educational projects. NHAs are supported through public-private partnerships, and the Trump administration had refused to release congressionally approved funding for them.
A Freedom’s Frontier spokesman said during a conversation for the Kansas Reflector podcast in June that the organization would cease to exist without the federal support. He urged anyone who cares about preserving history to contact their representatives in Washington.
The funding was released on Tuesday.
In a statement, Lucinda Adams, executive director of Freedom’s Frontier, said “advocacy turned the tide.”
“Because of the dedication and advocacy of our friends and partners across the region, we are now able to continue our core mission of promoting tourism and economic development in rural Kansas and Missouri,” said Lucinda Adams, executive director of Freedom’s Frontier. “Your calls and conversations with your representatives mattered. We are deeply grateful.”
U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Kansas Democrat, and U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II, a Missouri Democrat, sent a letter in June to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget urging the release of funds for Freedom’s Frontier and other National Heritage Areas. The freeze was lifted in July, but reduced staffing at the National Park Service caused further delays and uncertainty, according to a statement from Freedom’s Frontier. The funding would have expired if not distributed before Sept. 30.
Freedom’s Frontier unites more than 200 sites across 41 counties in eastern Kansas and western Missouri. Collectively, they preserve the story of the border war that preceded Kansas’ entry into the union, the enduring struggle for freedom and the settlement of the western frontier.
The sites include the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum in Independence, Missouri, the Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park in Topeka, the Little House on the Prairie Museum in Independence, Kansas, the Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum and Hangar Museum in Atchison, and the American Jazz Museum in Kansas City, Missouri.
Johnny Szlauderbach, director of communications and strategic projects at Freedom’s Frontier, said on the Kansas Reflector podcast in June that the organization was working to “make sure that people understand that these stories are nationally significant.”
“This area is interesting in that it’s served as a kind of microcosm for concepts of freedom throughout American history,” Szlauderbach said, from the abolition of slavery to the fight for women’s suffrage, to the landmark legal battle that ended segregation in public schools.
“This is a testing ground. We serve to be stewards of that nationally significant story,” Szlauderbach said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P6130212-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-03 18:59:01.781341

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho state government agencies’ budget requests for the next fiscal year are now publicly available. 
The requests are online on the Division of Financial Management’s website, and are for Idaho’s fiscal year 2027, which starts July 1, 2026. 
Last month, Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered all state government agencies besides public schools to cut their budgets mid-year by 3% ahead of an $80 million projected budget shortfall. But the budget shortfall estimate didn’t account for tax cuts in President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which could cost Idaho another $167 million to implement, the Idaho Capital Sun reported.
The budget request for Idaho’s largest state government agency, the Department of Health and Welfare, was not available online by 4 p.m. Wednesday. 
The requests are one of the first major steps in the process to fund state government. 
In January, Little typically releases his own proposed state budget. Then the Idaho Legislature, which usually meets during the first few months of the year, considers budget requests by state agencies and the governor as lawmakers craft budget bills. 
Idaho’s powerful budget-setting committee, the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, has shifted to a different budgeting process that splits agency budgets into barebones funding and new spending.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier / NC Newsline)North Carolina’s public schools reached their highest graduation rate in history last year, while students also posted a three-year high on most standardized tests, according to test data presented Wednesday to the State Board of Education.
The state’s four-year cohort graduation rate climbed to 87.7% for the 2024-25 school year, marking the third consecutive increase. 
“We’re very excited, of course, today to recognize the highest four-year cohort graduation rate for North Carolina at 87.7%,” said Tammy Howard, the Department of Public Instruction’s senior director of accountability and testing, during a press conference on Wednesday. “This is a consistent increase for the past three years, but most notable, the highest ever.” 
The report showed improvements in 12 of 15 reading and math exams, including gains on every end-of-grade math test for grades three through eight. Howard said the results also revealed steady progress across all racial and ethnic groups, the strongest performance in three years.

“These results represent more than just numbers,” said State Superintendent Mo Green. “They represent thousands of students better prepared for their next phase in life.” 
One of the standouts was Nash Early College High School, which earned an overall A rating and exceeded academic growth targets for the sixth year in a row. Students there achieved proficiency rates of 83% in biology, 89% in math and 96% in English. 
Principal Thomas B. McGeachy attributed the school’s success to its strong culture of teamwork and willingness to take risks.. “I’ve tried to create an environment where I encourage staff and scholars to take risks,” he said during the press conference. “Don’t be afraid of failure, because if you didn’t achieve what you wanted to that means you reflect on the experience and you build upon it.” 
Frederick Lindsay, a 13th-grader at the school, said the school’s dual enrollment program with Nash Community College gave him new experiences that reshaped his goals. 
“Since we’re linked with Nash Community College, we have a wide variety of opportunities,” Lindsay said. “I got to experience a new country for the first time for $500 to stay there for five days. That’s an opportunity that you wouldn’t get many places.”
Challenges remain
While math proficiency is nearing pre-pandemic levels, only 52.5% of third- through eighth-graders were proficient in reading last year, a rate still below the 57.3% recorded six years ago.
“Reading is more difficult and takes more time,” said said Stacey Wilson-Norman, chief academic officer. “Our teachers have been trained, but we just need to align some of the other supports to really accelerate that progress.”
Green noted that North Carolina ranks 48th nationally in per-pupil spending, nearly $5,000 less per student than the national average, which could constrain future improvements. That gap, he said, makes it harder to attract the best teachers and to offer a full range of resources.
Officials also pointed to lingering setbacks from the pandemic and natural disasters, including lost instructional days in western school districts impacted y Hurricane Helene.
Despite these challenges, state leaders said the gains mark an important step toward their goal of making North Carolina’s public schools the best in the nation by 2030.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_7295-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-03 18:59:01.781341

“It's a great nation,” said Sen. Russ Ingalls, R-Essex. “I want a news source that’s going to report and reflect (that) accurately.”

Courtney Cutting has listened to the local radio stations around her hometown of St. Johnsbury for as long as she can remember. Her listening hit a stride two summers ago, she said, when flood damage shuttered the diner she worked at, putting her out of a job.
But last month, Cutting noticed a change on the airwaves. The newscasts that her favorite station — WMTK “The Notch” — played at the top of the hour, and which she relied on for national and international news, sounded different.
“When it would come on, I would turn up the radio to be like, ‘What am I hearing?’ Cutting said in an interview. “And then that’s when I got the end tagline, which is, ‘America’s listening to Fox News.’”
“The Notch” is one of seven stations based in the area where Cutting grew up that are now owned and operated by Essex County Republican Sen. Russ Ingalls. The Newport real estate broker purchased the media group earlier this year in a $1 million deal with longtime local broadcaster Bruce James. The stations, which air different types of music and some sports and talk programs, broadcast throughout the district Ingalls serves in the Senate.
Cutting emailed Ingalls to ask about the change, and when the senator replied, it confirmed what she had suspected for weeks: While the seven stations previously aired news from a mix of sources, he had switched all of the broadcasts, solely, to Fox News. Ingalls told VTDigger that, before the change in early August, the stations played news from either the Associated Press or the major broadcasters ABC, CBS and NBC.
Cutting wrote back, in an exchange she shared with VTDigger, that the switch had left her frustrated. To her ears, she wrote to Ingalls, the Fox newscasts offered scant context about the many controversial actions taken by President Donald Trump’s administration in recent months, and often lacked the perspectives of people who opposed them.

Ingalls contended in response that the reaction he’d received from listeners after changing the newscasts had been overwhelmingly positive. He told VTDigger he had received more than 1,400 supportive messages from local residents since he made the change, while he’d so far had only “two confirmed emails of dissatisfaction.” 
“I’m sorry that you don’t like the president,” Ingalls wrote to Cutting. “I didn’t like the last one much but he was still the president. I don’t know what I can tell you that will help you other than it was a good business decision based on what we are hearing.”
The stations Ingalls operates include WMOO “Moo 92,” JJ Country and WIKE “The Notch” in Newport; Magic 97.7, Kix 105.5 and WSTJ out of the St. Johnsbury area; as well as WMTK “The Notch” in Littleton, New Hampshire.
Earlier this year, as he was starting to operate the local radio group, the senator told VTDigger he did not want to make the stations’ content more political — even as he, himself, is one of the area’s most recognizable politicians. In an interview this week, he contended he was motivated to change the newscasts not by his conservative politics, but by the repeated requests he heard from listeners to “do something about the news.”
None of those listeners specifically asked for a change to Fox News, Ingalls said. He settled on that network because people were asking for more “positive” stories about the country, he continued, something he believes Fox News provides. He said he’s frustrated by “negative” news coverage of Trump in mainstream news sources.

“Just because CBS, ABC, NBC and AP hate Trump doesn’t mean that the rest of America does. I mean, he’s our president,” Ingalls said. “I was tired of the negativity that was coming from all those other news sources. That’s not what my stations are about. That’s not what Russ Ingalls is about. It’s not … how I run my businesses. I like cohesiveness. I like people getting along and being together.”
He contended, too, that the decision had nothing to do with supporting Trump.
“I don’t give two shits about Trump. I really don’t. But it’s the country in itself — this country is doing very, very well. It really, really is. It’s a great nation,” he said. “I want a news source that’s going to report and reflect (that) accurately.”
Fox News’ radio programming is syndicated to about 1,500 stations across the country, according to a company press release. The network frequently features pro-Trump opinion hosts; the president’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, has her own program on the network.
In 2021, Fox News was sued by the voting equipment manufacturer Dominion Voting Systems over claims the network’s hosts had knowingly peddled falsehoods that Dominion rigged the 2020 presidential election so Trump would lose. The news giant later agreed to pay about $790 million in damages to resolve the case. 
Ingalls is well-known as one of the Vermont Senate’s most conservative voices. He faced criticism from the state’s Democratic Party in April when he was one of a handful of members of the chamber to vote against a resolution condemning the arrest of Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student activist, by masked federal immigration agents in Colchester. The Columbia University student, who was a prominent leader of pro-Palestinian protests on campus, was later ordered released by a federal judge.
To be sure, Ingalls also represents some of the state’s most politically conservative areas. In Essex County, which makes up most of his district, 55% of voters supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election, compared to 33% on average statewide. 
Cutting, the longtime radio listener, said there are other changes Ingalls has made to the stations’ content that she likes. She said she’s noticed more spotlights on local businesses — “that is a wicked cool idea” — and regular on-air listings of community events. There’s even a show Ingalls hosts himself that “I just love to listen to,” she said.
“I really stand behind the way he wants to use it in building community, and making it a forum to foster these kinds of conversations,” Cutting said of the radio network.
“We need to be informed and have hard conversations as a community,” she said — but added that if “all of these radio stations go to one news source that isn’t reporting the full breadth of the news, then, what’s there going to be to talk about?”

(Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)The State Board of Pharmacy held a special meeting on Wednesday to vote on a measure to effectively bypass the immunization recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), following concerns that federal health authorities may politicize recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination.
The  board is responsible for determining when and to whom pharmacists can administer vaccines. Historically, it has followed the recommendations of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a panel of experts who issue guidance for the nation’s doctors and pharmacists.
The measure voted on by the board unanimously will allow the State Board of Pharmacy to issue guidance based on the recommendations of three medical professional societies: the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, as well as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The professional organizations comprise thousands of doctors from specialized fields of medicine, and have long been involved in the study and creation of vaccination guidelines based on evidence and rigorous scientific review. Each group has recommended broad use of COVID-19 vaccinations.

Wednesday’s vote means, despite the federal vaccine advisory panel not yet issuing COVID-19 immunization guidelines, pharmacies across the state can administer the latest seasonal vaccines as soon as they obtain them. However, a spokesperson for Gov. Josh Shapiro advised Pennsylvanians who want a vaccine to first contact their pharmacy.
Grace Sesi, the executive director of regulatory affairs for CVS Health, which operates the nation’s largest pharmacy chain, spoke at the board meeting to support the measure. She said CVS pharmacies in Pennsylvania have already received the latest COVID-19 vaccines and are “ready to act with urgency” to administer them.
The board scheduled the meeting after concerns were raised by Shapiro, as well as doctors and pharmacists across the commonwealth, that the federal panel’s recommendations may be guided more by politics than science. 
In June, U.S. Sec. of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime and outspoken vaccine skeptic, removed and replaced all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee. And in May, Kennedy said that the CDC would no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women, citing no specific studies and potentially putting the authority’s guidelines at odds with professional associations representing thousands of pediatricians, gynecologists, family doctors and scientists across the country.
While the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has yet to issue vaccination guidelines for this year’s seasonal COVID-19 shots, it is scheduled to meet later this month. But already, the Food and Drug Administration, which approves vaccines for public use, has deviated from its typical recommendation that virtually all adults and children over six months old receive the shot. Instead, it has suggested its use only for those 65 and older, as well as for children and adults with health conditions that place them at risk of more severe infection from COVID-19.
The move signaled that immunization recommendations from federal health authorities may be at odds with mainstream scientific consensus among doctors and researchers.
Rob Bonacci, a clinician, former CDC employee and special advisor to Pennsylvania’s secretary of Health, told the State Board of Pharmacy that recent changes at the federal vaccine advisory panel “have left many concerned about the integrity of the [vaccination] review process, and the trustworthiness of those recommendations.” 
“We’re in new territory,” he added. “When I think about where else I go as a public health professional and a clinician for public health guidance, I think of our professional organizations.”
A spokesperson for the State Board of Pharmacy referred questions from the Capital-Star to Shapiro’s office.
Following the vote, Shapiro issued a statement applauding the board’s decision and calling efforts by the Trump administration to limit COVID-19 vaccine access “outrageous.”
“I called on the State Board of Pharmacy to hold a special meeting to bring clarity to the people of Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said in the statement. “Health care decisions should be up to individuals — not the federal government and certainly not RFK Jr. My Administration will continue to protect health care access for all Pennsylvanians.” 
Some lawmakers have also made moves to ensure pharmacists in Pennsylvania can administer vaccines, regardless of the recommendations of the CDC’s immunization advisory panel.
On Tuesday, Rep. Arvind Venkat (D-Allegheny), an emergency physician, issued a memo announcing his intention to introduce a bill he says will put immunization recommendations for Pennsylvanians in the hands of state health authorities instead of federal ones.
“Chaos in federal health agency policymaking, which is no longer backed by scientific evidence, but instead by anti-vaccine ideology, will cost people’s lives,” Venkat said. “This legislation will allow Pennsylvanians to avoid this politicization of healthcare and get the life-saving vaccines they need, even if the federal government stops recommending them purely due to politics.”
A previous bill introduced by Venkat would also require insurance companies to cover vaccines recommended by state health authorities and medical professional organizations.

Officials announced a proposed consent order on Wednesday, filed in federal court in the district of Utah, in conjunction with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. It targets Aylo, which operates websites like Pornhub, Redtube and, as Margaret Busse put it, “hundreds of other sites with names that are really too obscene to mention.” 
“Aylo has openly, repeatedly and severely violated Utah’s consumer protection laws for years by allowing the unconscionable distribution of the worst of the worst,” said Busse, the executive director of the Utah Department of Commerce, during a news conference. 
In addition to the $5 million, Aylo will be required to implement a more stringent review and regulatory process on its websites.

According to court documents, since 2012 Aylo profited off of the distribution of “tens of thousands” of videos and images depicting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and non-consentual material (NCM), which includes things like revenge porn, rape, secretley recorded videos and “other absolutely appaling categories of content,” said Melissa Holyoak, commissioner with the FTC. 
“One of Aylo’s employees referred to Pornhub as a ‘goldmine for rape content,’” Holyoak said Wednesday during the press conference. 
Aylo’s websites are incredibly popular — In 2021, its sites saw a total of 800 million monthly visits from U.S. consumers, per court documents.
According to the complaint, the company falsely claimed CSAM and NCM content could be flagged by users and removed; that it would ban users that uploaded CSAM and NCM; that content previously flagged would be “fingerprinted” so it could not be re-uploaded; and that it would verify the ages of people in its videos. 
Users would then view, download and further distribute these videos “millions of times, often not knowing it was CSAM or NCM,” further victimizing people in the video according to court documents. 
Officials say Aylo only started to restrict CSAM and NCM after credit card processing companies began threatening the company with fines. 
“All of this adds up to a portrait of a company that has no intention to comply with its own policies, even when called out by credit card companies, journalists, and just a general public outcry,” Busse said, telling reporters Aylo was not only motivated by “unprecedented profits,” but seemed to “relish spreading this kind of content for its own sake.”
The proposed consent order directs Aylo to pay the state of Utah $5 million that Busse said will go into a consumer protection education fund. The company will also be required to pay an additional $10 million if it violates the terms of the settlement. 
According to court documents, Aylo will now:

Implement a program preventing the dissemination of CSAM and NCM, which includes “policies, procedures and technical measures to ensure that such content is not published on its websites and a process to respond to reports about CSAM and NCM content.” 
Create a verification system to ensure people who appear in videos on Aylo’s websites provide their consent. 
Remove all content uploaded prior to the agreement until Aylo verifies the people in the videos were consenting adults. 
Post a notice on its websites informing users about the allegations and legal action. 
Establish a privacy and information security program. 

In a statement, an Aylo spokesperson said the settlement “reaffirms and enhances Aylo’s efforts to prevent the publication of child sexual abuse material and non-consensual material on its platforms.” 
The company also pointed to several safety measures it’s taken in recent years, including verification requirements for users who upload content and proof of consent and identification for performers. And, it said the allegations levied by Utah and the FTC all stem from content uploaded before 2020 — since then, Aylo has implemented a number of safety features.  
“The resolution reached involved enhancements to existing measures but did not introduce any  new substantive requirements that were not either already in place or in progress,” a statement from the company reads.
Holyoak said that’s why the settlement is important — it will require Aylo to review all existing materials while strengthening future protections. 
“It ensures the protection of the current content on the website, but then it goes further, now we have prevention for future materials that might be uploaded. It’s such an important guardrail,” she said. 
According to Utah Attorney General Derek Brown, an independent third party will audit Aylo and its websites over the next 10 years to ensure its compliance. If they violate the terms of the settlement, they could face criminal action in addition to the increased fine. 
“If they don’t do these things, let me be very clear, I will take them back to court,” Brown said. “For years, Aylo ignored hundreds of thousands of flags on its videos, including those flagged by its consumers as potentially CSAM or NCM. As of today, they can no longer do that.”

Meanwhile, attorneys for Trevor Jones, who resigned the $164,800-a-year job in 2022, filed their own brief with the Nebraska Supreme Court maintaining that the AG’s office had errored in trying to appeal the discharge.
The competing court briefs are the latest chapter in an on-again, off-again prosecution of Jones. He was alleged to have committed theft by deception for redirecting $270,000 in funds provided by the private Nebraska State Historical Society Foundation to a competing foundation he had set up.
The funds were intended to cover expected operating losses by the Nebraska State Historical Society during the COVID-19 pandemic, and state auditors maintained the funds should have been deposited with the State Treasurer, not another foundation.
Theft by deception is punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
But the state’s prosecution of the case was first dismissed by a Lancaster County District Court Judge for violating Jones’ right to a speedy trial. A later appeal was discharged by the State Court of Appeals for not following proper court procedures.
The Attorney General’s Office, in a brief written by Solicitor General Zachary Viglianco, argued that Appeals Court Judge Frankie Moore misapplied past court precedent in granting a discharge of the prosecution.
Viglianco maintained that the AG’s office had followed proper procedure in appealing the judge’s ruling, which it argued was a “special proceeding” that is “inherently” a civil matter, thus allowing an appeal.
But Jones’ attorneys have contended and repeated in the brief Tuesday that the discharge was a “criminal” matter, and, by rule, the Attorney General’s Office had no right to appeal a final ruling of a “substantial right” — a speedy trial.
The Attorney General’s Office filed the criminal charge in December 2023 against Jones, who had served six years at chief of the agency, which he had rebranded as “History Nebraska.” The name change was reversed by Gov. Jim Pillen.
Jones resigned in 2022 — saying he wanted to travel in Europe — shortly before a state audit came out that was critical of the redirection of the funds.
It was uncertain when the Nebraska Supreme Court might schedule oral arguments and rule on the appeal.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma higher education leaders said Wednesday that they are concerned lawmakers might not have allocated enough funding to meet demand when children of public school teachers become eligible to participate in the expansion of a state-funded scholarship program.
Officials said applications are expected to open later this month, but the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education were allocated $700,000 to fund the expansion of Oklahoma’s Promise, which could cover costs for 15 students, said Colbi Beam, assistant vice chancellor of state grants and scholarships.
“It’s not going to go very far,” she said. “We have no idea what the impact will be for enrollment, but I’m really interested to see. We’ve gotten a lot of buzz and a ton of teacher phone calls.”
Under House Bill 1727, which took effect July 1, a teacher can apply for their child to participate in the program if the educator is certified and teaching in Oklahoma public schools for at least 10 years and their household meets income eligibility requirements. School administrators and emergency certified teachers are not included. 
Beam said allowing Oklahoma public school teachers to be eligible to apply for a state-funded scholarship program, which has traditionally helped lower-income students afford college, amount to some of the most “substantial changes” to Oklahoma’s Promise since its inception.
“With Oklahoma’s Promise in general, I think we’ve moved away from our mission a little,” she said. “I think we need to refocus on the students who need access. I think we are adding more administrative steps for students to be eligible instead of reducing those. So if I had a magic wand, I’d want to make it easier on students to apply.”
Students who are in the current cohort of high school seniors will be the first to be eligible for the extension of Oklahoma’s Promise. 
The scholarship program offers qualified Oklahoma students an opportunity to earn a scholarship for college tuition. The measure extends the program’s application window to Dec. 31 of the student’s senior year. 
The household income of the student’s parents must be less than 700% the federal poverty level. For a four-person household, this equates to an income of $225,050. 
Traditional Oklahoma’s Promise students will continue to qualify with  separate financial eligibility qualifications. 
The financial impact of Oklahoma’s Promise for educators’ children is estimated to be over $740,000 in the first year and to exceed $3 million by the fourth year, according to the Legislature’s fiscal impact report.",https://oklahomavoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/7FD038E3-71A2-4E42-92C7-5B7535943993_1_201_a-1024x724.jpeg,,,2025-09-03 18:59:01.781341
,DC,2025-09-03 22:36:42+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump speculates New Orleans is next as he weighs National Guard expansion,"Jacob Fischler, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-speculates-new-orleans-next-he-weighs-national-guard-expansion,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump was unclear Wednesday about his plans to deploy National Guard troops to cities around the country, seeming to backtrack slightly on sending troops to Chicago while teasing New Orleans as a possible next location instead.Despite a Tuesday morning ruling from a federal judge in California that called Trump’s use of military personnel for law enforcement in Los Angeles illegal, the president continued to explore further use of Guard units for what he said is crime prevention in other U.S. cities. But in the face of pushback from Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, and other state and city officials in Chicago, Trump said Wednesday he still wanted to send troops to the city, but may be more inclined to call up the Guard in a politically friendlier state.“We're making a determination now,” Trump said during an Oval Office appearance Wednesday morning. “Do we go to Chicago? Or do we go to a place like New Orleans, where we have a great governor, Jeff Landry, who wants us to come in and straighten out a very nice section of this country that's become quite tough, quite bad.”Landry, a Republican, said on social media Wednesday he would accept federal troops.“We will take President @realDonaldTrump’s help from New Orleans to Shreveport!” he said.Third Democratic city for National Guard?If the president follows through, it would be the third heavily Democratic city where he orders troops this year. He deployed the California National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles this summer and called Guard members from multiple states — including Louisiana — to the District of Columbia while also seizing the police force in the city. The president has said he’s using troops to quell crime, despite violent crime decreasing in cities across the country. Last month, the president signed an executive order directing state National Guard units to be ready to assist in local, state and federal law enforcement, a potential step toward a dramatic expansion of Trump’s use of military personnel for domestic policing.The use of the military has stemmed from the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and plans for mass deportations. The president deployed troops to Los Angeles following massive protests against federal immigration officers' aggressive tactics. In the District of Columbia, immigration officials and federal law enforcement officers have established checkpoints in metro stations and elsewhere inquiring about immigration status. Chicago is considered by Republicans to be a “sanctuary city,” because it leaves immigration enforcement to the federal government. The Trump administration has slammed those policies, attempting to revoke federal funding from cities and states with similar stances.Trump has also mentioned Baltimore as another candidate for Guard deployment.‘All they have to do is ask’Pritzker’s opposition was keeping him from deploying troops to Chicago, Trump said. Governors control their states’ National Guard units, except in rare circumstances in which the president can assume control. Trump this summer federalized the California National Guard over the objection of Gov. Gavin Newsom, but has waffled about repeating that experience with Chicago. “We could straighten out Chicago,” he said Wednesday. “All they have to do is ask us to go into Chicago.”A day earlier, Trump indicated it was only a matter of time before he sent troops to the largest city in the Midwest.“Chicago is a hellhole right now,” he said late Tuesday. “We're going in. I didn't say when. We're going in.”If Trump were to either send Guard members from another state into Illinois or federalize the state’s troops, it would likely see swift legal action. Pritzker told reporters Tuesday state leaders would have to see how the administration acts before bringing a lawsuit.Louisiana Republicans praise TrumpLike Landry, U.S. Sen. John Kennedy said he and his fellow Louisiana Republican, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, supported the idea of a Guard presence.“Unlike Democratic governors, @SpeakerJohnson and I aren’t scared of a little help from the brave men and women of our National Guard,” he wrote on X. “Anybody who actually wants to stop crime would welcome our troops in a skinny minute.”Christopher Mirasola, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center, said he found the idea of Trump mobilizing a red-state Guard “confusing” because that state’s troops are already controlled by its Republican governor.“If the governor of Louisiana wanted to use the military for some kind of law enforcement action in Louisiana, he certainly has the authority to do it under Louisiana law,” he said.“There really is no role for the federal government. In fact, the governor of Louisiana probably has more authority under state law to use the National Guard for these domestic deployments than if the National Guard was used under some federal authority.”Texas gov’s office denies Pritzker reportSpeaking to reporters shortly after Trump’s Tuesday comments, Pritzker said a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official had recently called the head of the Illinois State Police to inform state officials that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents would soon be sent there.The call was the only communication state leaders have had with the administration about its plans for the city, Pritzker said.“It's the first outreach we have received from the Trump administration on this topic,” he said.Without clear communication from Trump officials, Pritzker said he sought information from anonymous federal workers and well-placed reporters. Information from those people led Pritzker to believe the administration was readying to deploy the Texas National Guard to the state, he said.“We have reason to believe that the Trump administration has already begun staging the Texas National Guard for deployment in Illinois,” Pritzker said. “We know before anything has happened here, that the Trump plan is to use any excuse to deploy armed military personnel to Chicago.”That report has not been verified and an aide to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott denied such a deployment was imminent.Abbott has tangled with Pritzker before on national issues. He bused migrants to Chicago during an immigration wave in President Joe Biden’s term in office.The White House declined to comment Wednesday. ‘It would be an invasion’If Pritzker’s information was correct, and Guard troops from Texas or another state were sent to Illinois without Pritzker’s consent, it would represent a new development in Trump’s use of military members within the U.S. — and could cross a red line of state sovereignty — legal experts told States Newsroom.“It would be an invasion,” Stephen Dycus, a professor emeritus in national security law at the Vermont Law and Graduate School, said.“I’m not aware of that ever happening in the past, and I don’t think it would be legal,” Dycus said. “There's no provision in the Constitution or anywhere else that would allow one state to attack or invade another for any purpose.”Joseph Nunn, counsel in the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program, agreed that it would be a “constitutional barrier” for one state’s governor to send National Guard troops to another without that governor’s approval.Illinois would quickly challenge such a deployment and would likely prevail in litigation, Nunn said.But Mirasola said because courts have never considered the issue, it is not clear a challenge by Illinois would succeed.Courts, including a unanimous 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel hearing a case on the National Guard’s deployment to Los Angeles this year, have given the executive branch “incredible deference” to mobilize the National Guard, Mirasola said. “It's a pretty close analysis in terms of which way I think courts would land on the issue,” he said. “I don't think it's clear.”A safer legal route for Trump could be to federalize one state’s National Guard and send them to Illinois or another state that does not request a deployment, Nunn said.“It’s far more likely that you see a red state’s National Guard being voluntarily federalized — federalized with the consent of the governor — and then deployed to Illinois,” he said. “Because in that circumstance those become essentially federal troops. And the president can send federal troops wherever he wants to send them.”",,,,2025-09-03 18:59:01.781341

Gabe Vasquez on Wednesday predicted that small-time farmers and ranchers, as well as small grocery stores, in rural areas of his congressional district will be devastated by Republican food assistance cuts. 
Vasquez, in an interview with Source New Mexico, cited a new report from the Washington-based nonprofit Food Research & Action Center that found rural areas will be the hardest hit by changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program contained in the“One Big Beautiful Bill Act” 
“There is a cruel irony in the sense that some of our farmers and ranchers and rural food producers are the ones who stand to lose the most from these Republican cuts to food assistance,” said Vasquez, a Democrat in his second term representing New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District. 
The report cited the ways in which SNAP cuts will hit hardest in non-urban areas, which have higher poverty rates, fewer food retailers and less employment opportunities. The report also revealed that more than three-quarters of 303 “high risk” counties nationwide — counties identified as highly reliant on a small number of SNAP-approved retailers — are rural. 
Nineteen of New Mexico’s 33 counties — most of them rural — appear on a list from the left-leaning Center for American Progress identifying where retailers are at the highest risk of closing due to the SNAP cuts. 
NM Pueblo leader says recent USDA tribal food program cuts means more reliance on ‘commodities’

New Mexico also has the highest rate of SNAP recipients in the country, which Vasquez said puts a “huge bull’s eye on the state of New Mexico” when it comes to these cuts.
Vasquez said the reductions in SNAP benefits to families and individuals will mean the closure of rural grocery stores. He listed grocery stores in Lordsburg and Sunland Park that he said receive three-quarters or more of their revenue from SNAP. 
Recent estimates from the state Health Care Authority predict about 1,700 gas stations, groceries, convenience stores and farmers’ markets statewide stand to lose about $1.3 billion in SNAP revenue. 
“So not only are we taking food away from rural communities that produce our food, but we’re also potentially putting their grocery stores out of business,” Vasquez said. “And that’s just not a solution that works for rural New Mexico.”
The spending bill President Donald Trump signed July 4 imposes costs on states to administer SNAP, plus extra costs for states like New Mexico with high SNAP administration error rates. It also reduces SNAP benefits and imposes work requirements. 
NM food banks say they will struggle to provide meals for those who lose federal benefits

All told, New Mexico’s 450,000 SNAP recipients will experience benefit reductions, and 40,000 will lose their SNAP entirely due to work requirements or their immigration status, according to the Health Care Authority estimates.
Vasquez said he continues to push for changes in the Farm Bill that would reduce some of the cuts, and he said he’s working with state lawmakers to find ways to mitigate the cuts on residents or the state budget.
The state can update eligibility rules, for example, to remove child support payments from taxable income, which will make more families eligible for SNAP, Vasquez said. Lawmakers can also shore up cuts with the state’s “healthy” budget reserve for the short-term, at least until Democrats regain the majority, Vasquez said.
“Between Medicaid and SNAP, this state Legislature is going to have an important job to do,” Vasquez said. “And I wish it wasn’t this way, but it is the reality that New Mexico faces, thanks to the action of Republicans and this administration who chose to cut food assistance.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0573-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-03 18:59:01.781341
,California,2025-09-03 22:04:29+00:00,CalMatters,ACLU argues Border Patrol broke court order with high-profile Sacramento raid,Wendy Fry and Sergio Olmos,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/09/aclu-border-patrol-sacramento-motion/,"After agents were forced to stop ‘roving patrols’ in LA, they moved north to Sacramento. But a judge had already restricted raids there.","In summary
After agents were forced to stop ‘roving patrols’ in LA, they moved north to Sacramento. But a judge had already restricted raids there. 


The ACLU and United Farm Workers have filed a motion alleging that the Border Patrol violated a court order intended to curb racial profiling and unlawful, warrantless arrests in the Central Valley. 
They want the judge to require new training and forbid agents involved in a July raid in Sacramento from participating in other operations until they are retrained. 
In April, a federal district court judge ruled that the Border Patrol likely violated the Constitution’s protections against unreasonable search and seizure during a January operation in Kern County called “Operation Return to Sender,” in which agents swarmed a Home Depot and Latino market, among other areas frequented by laborers. The judge ordered the Border Patrol, led by El Centro Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, to stop the raids in California’s Eastern District, which covers much of the state’s Central Valley, including Sacramento. 


Bovino in June took his agents to Los Angeles, where they spent weeks aggressively pursuing Latino-looking workers outside of Home Depots, car washes, bus stops and other areas. The agents often wore masks and used unmarked vehicles.  
After a federal district court judge temporarily barred agents from conducting raids in the Los Angeles area, Bovino briefly moved north to Sacramento in July, detaining Latino day laborers in a Home Depot parking lot. 
In an interview near the parking lot with Fox News, Bovino indicated at the time that his operations were ramping up, not slowing down. “There is no sanctuary anywhere,” Bovino said.
“We’re here to stay. We’re not going anywhere. We’re going to affect this mission and secure the homeland.”
Bovino told Fox the raids were targeted and based on intel. 
“Everything we do is targeted,” he said. “We did have prior intelligence that there were targets that we were interested in and around that Home Depot, as well as other targeted enforcement packages in and around the Sacramento area.”  
In a motion filed last week, the ACLU and the United Farm Workers asked the federal district court to enforce the preliminary injunction issued in April that barred Border Patrol agents from stopping people without reasonable suspicion and from making warrantless arrests without assessing flight risk. 
If granted, the motion could potentially bar Bovino from planning or participating in new raids in the Eastern District. Bovino appears to be moving on regardless: He announced Tuesday on his social media account that the LA crackdown would be expanding to other cities across the country.  
A Border Patrol spokesman did not return a request for comment about the ACLU and UFW’s motion. 
If the plaintiffs in the Kern County case are successful in getting a judge to strengthen or enforce the original injunction, the case could have nationwide implications, providing a legal strategy that could be replicated in communities where agents are using similar tactics. In Los Angeles and Southern California, agents have continued high-profile raids and violent tactics, despite a similar but separate temporary restraining order in the Central District, barring similar activity there.


As part of the original preliminary injunction, Border Patrol agents were required to provide the ACLU with documentation on their specific and individual reasonable suspicion for each warrantless stop. 
The plaintiffs allege agents fabricated and copied and pasted boilerplate language for those reports from the raid at the Home Depot in south Sacramento.
According to the filing, dozens of armed and masked agents from the Border Patrol, ICE, and other federal agencies corralled people in the parking lot in Sacramento, ordering them not to move while demanding to see their papers. 
Witnesses described unmarked Chevy trucks, agents dressed “like soldiers,” and people being grabbed and handcuffed with no explanation. At least one U.S. citizen was chased and detained during the operation, but Border Patrol won’t release that arrest report to the ACLU because they said it was unrelated to an immigration violation, according to the court documents. The agency told the media that the man slashed one of their tires in the parking lot. 
Student detained near Home Depot sweep
Agents also tackled and arrested an 18-year-old high school student who happened to be walking to a nearby Ross, according to the ACLU and UFW’s motion. 
Selvin Osbeli Mejia Diaz, a senior at Valley High School, fled violence in Central America last year and came to the United States as an unaccompanied minor. He lives with his aunt in Sacramento and is complying with the orders in his immigration court case seeking asylum, according to the ACLU and UFW motion. 
According to his declaration, he was walking to the store to buy a shirt when an unmarked Chevy pulled up behind him. A masked agent burst out from the vehicle, tackled him to the ground, and handcuffed him without asking any questions, according to Mejia Diaz’s declaration. 
“Everything happened very fast, and I felt very afraid because I did not know who the man was,” Mejia Diaz wrote in his declaration. “He was much taller than me and he used a lot of force, and he immediately handcuffed me while I was on the ground … I think they saw me and figured they could arrest me because I looked Latino.” 
Mejia Diaz was born in Guatemala and turned himself in to border agents in June 2024 after crossing the U.S. border. After the Home Depot raid, he was taken to a detention center in downtown Sacramento, where he had to sleep on a hard ceramic floor with an aluminum blanket. He said he was detained for several days before he was allowed to call his aunt for a couple of minutes. 
He is still being detained in the Imperial Regional Detention Facility. 
The Border Patrol’s arrest report for Mejia Diaz incorrectly states he was in the Home Depot parking lot, the ACLU alleges, which they say supports their assertion that agents are using “copy and pasted” language for each arrest report.
How the Border Patrol justified arrests
The ACLU also says that Border Patrol’s official documentation of the raid, required by the court order, is riddled with other factual errors and boilerplate language. 
The forms, known as Form I-213s, are meant to document agents’ reasonable suspicions for each warrantless stop they make. During discovery, Border Patrol gave the ACLU 11 such arrest reports for the Sacramento raid. Three of them included “X” placeholders instead of specific information about locations or names or details for the arrests. 
Nearly every report used identical language, claiming people “fled from agents” as a factor in the agents’ reasonable suspicion. Several witnesses told the ACLU some people did not run, according to the motion. The plaintiffs also argue that running from masked, armed men who do not identify themselves should not be enough for reasonable suspicion. 
A handful of the reports justified the warrantless arrests by stating: “Sacramento, California has been identified as a city where many illegal aliens are known to stay, live and work without having any legal documentation in the United States.” Others noted that California is a sanctuary state. 
“(Person) was located in California, which is a sanctuary state. Sanctuary states shield the identity of illegal aliens from immigration officials,” the arrest reports noted. The plaintiffs argue that someone being in a sanctuary state is not enough cause to give an agent reasonable suspicion that they are in the country illegally.  (California’s sanctuary law curbs local law enforcement cooperation with immigration authorities and prevents the automatic transfer of people to federal immigration custody, except for people who have been convicted of serious or violent felonies.) 
Border Patrol would not provide reports for individuals who were detained but then released, the motion states. The ACLU is asking the judge to shorten the amount of time Border Patrol has to share the arrest reports from seven days to four days because many of the people detained in the Sacramento raid had already been deported by the time they got the arrest reports, according to their motion. 
A hearing on the motion to enforce the injunction is set for October in Fresno.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/062025_ICE-Raid_GETTY_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-03 18:59:01.781341

The town and village of Johnson on Tuesday announced they were entering into a partnership with Vermont State University to relocate town services onto the school’s campus in Johnson.
Essential town services like Johnson’s municipal offices, post office, and the town’s health center could move onto the university’s campus — which sits on higher ground, out of reach from the Lamoille and Gihon rivers’ floodplain, according to a joint announcement from officials with the town, village and university.
Johnson was hard hit by the July 2023 floods. The town offices, health center, post office and grocery store were all displaced, along with many homes and businesses in the area. The town in April this year moved its public library a half-mile through town and across the river — not far from the university’s Johnson campus.
The parties plan to apply for funding from a federal community development block grant for disaster recovery in response to the July 2023 floods, according to the announcement, which was posted on social media.
The project, if borne out, would transform the university’s Matinetti Hall into a Community Services and Resilience Center. While final details will still need to be worked out, officials said the arrangement could blend the roles of the university and the town in new ways.
“We have the opportunity to create something here that’s a new model for how college campuses or other facilities in their communities can more purposefully work together,” said David Bergh, the president of Vermont State University.
Tom Galinat, the town administrator for Johnson, said they were “facilitating, hopefully, a new arrangement that allows both of us to prosper and to grow into a more resilient community.”
“There’s this wonderful symbiosis where the needs are crossing at the same time,” he said. “It’s really exciting.”
Vermont State University is in its third year of an integrated statewide university system. The Vermont State Colleges System in 2021 merged Castleton University, Northern Vermont University and Vermont Technical College into a single institution.
Much of the institution’s building stock is not being used to its current and anticipated needs, Bergh said. Meanwhile, the university, like many small colleges and universities, has seen declining enrollment.
“Across the country, you have college campuses closing, merging, being shuttered,” Bergh said. “Our intent is to keep these campuses vibrant, but to find a way to do so where we’re reducing our operational footprint and expense, and to do so really thoughtfully, and to do so in ways with partners that connect to our mission.”
The parties in their announcement said the “flood-resilient and energy-efficient hub” could “strengthen the campus-community connection, a long-held community goal.”
The futures of the campus and the community are “inextricably intertwined,” Bergh said, and he envisioned the partnership would bring services to campus that could connect to academic programs. A health clinic, for example, could tie in with the university’s nursing program on campus, he said.
“For us to recruit students and employees who want to be there on a campus, they want to come to a place that has a vibrant community with active businesses,” he said. “And then for those businesses to be successful, they need, in part, for us to keep bringing people in the community.”
While both sides expressed optimism for the “one of a kind” partnership, they acknowledged they are still early in the process, and, in their announcement, said “there are hurdles to clear before determining how best to move forward.”
The university will host a forum at the school’s Stearns Hall Performance Space to discuss the partnership on Tuesday, Sept. 16. The final application for the grant is due Sept. 30, Galinat said.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderThe special election to choose the next state senator in a suburban Atlanta district is going to a recount ahead of a Sept. 23 runoff.
Steve West, the third-place finisher in the race to replace Republican former state Sen. Brandon Beach, requested the recount Wednesday, a spokesman for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s office said.
Beach stepped down to serve as U.S. Treasurer, and seven people stepped up to replace him, including six Republicans and one Democrat in a reliably conservative district that includes parts of Cherokee and Fulton counties.
The sole Democrat, Milton mom, attorney and small business owner, Debra Shigley, placed first place with 8,444 votes, good for nearly 40% of the vote, but not good enough for an outright win.
Instead, she’ll duke it out in a runoff with the second-place finisher, who appears to be Jason Dickerson, a Republican investment manager, who earned just over 17% of the vote with 3,709 ballots cast. But West, a former Cherokee County Commissioner, trailed Dickerson by just 67 votes according to the initial count, putting him within the .5% margin required to call for a for a second tallying.
In a statement, West’s campaign confirmed they are seeking a runoff and are reviewing the results “to ensure no voting irregularities occurred that may have impacted the outcome of the election.”
State law doesn’t give a timeline for finishing a recount, but it’s likely that the counties will want to complete the recount quickly so they can finalize their runoff ballots. Early voting is set to begin as soon as Sept. 13 in some areas of the district.
Shigley’s performance last month was notable because Beach, a steadfast MAGA supporter, consistently won re-election by large margins in the heavily Republican district. Democrats hope her strong numbers show dissatisfaction with Republican leadership at the state and federal level and portend an anti-GOP mood going into next year’s midterms.
Republicans say Shigley’s margin was bolstered by the GOP vote being split six ways and that their candidate will easily win the runoff.
In a statement, Dickerson expressed confidence that both the recount and the runoff will go his way.
“We look forward to the recount confirming the certified result,” he said. “We won’t be distracted and will remain focused on defeating woke liberal Debra Shigley in the runoff that is already underway!”

Thomas Massie's crusade to release all the files on Epstein will have to be accomplished without support from Nebraskans in Congress,"U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, speaks during a news conference with 10 of the alleged victims of disgraced financier and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein outside the U.S. Capitol on Sept. 03, 2025 in Washington, D.C. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-California, have introduced the Epstein List Transparency Act to force the federal government to release all unclassified records from the cases of Epstein and his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)LINCOLN — A push to release all the federal government’s files on a Florida sex offender reemerged as Congress returned from the August break.
Kentucky U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie is pressing a discharge petition to force a vote to release more of the government’s files on Jeffrey Epstein, as a House oversight panel released some Epstein material Tuesday. What the panel released was already publicly available.
All of Nebraska’s House members voted Wednesday for a non-binding resolution to support the House’s oversight panel in continuing its investigation. But none signaled support for Massie’s effort to force the release of the fuller files.  
Nebraska’s 3rd Congressional District U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith said the “victims of Jeffrey Epstein deserve justice and said he would continue supporting efforts to bring justice to those complicit in Epstein’s crimes. But he said he would not sign onto a discharge petition, “which hands control of the House floor to congressional Democrats.” 
Nebraska’s 1st District U.S. Rep. Mike Flood told CNN Tuesday that he “doesn’t support discharge petitions,” because “I support regular order.” 
“We have a plan. It’s going to get implemented, and it’s going to happen this week,” Flood said in the interview. “What Massie and the Democrats are doing is all-out reckless … They do not have victim protection … it was written in a sloppy way.”

When asked by the Examiner whether or not he would join Massie’s discharge petition, Nebraska’s 2nd District U.S. Rep. Don Bacon said, “I’m going to vote on the bill that will come to the floor.”  
Bacon released a statement after Wednesday’s vote on the symbolic resolution saying he had voted to “release the Epstein files.” He called the House resolution “more far-reaching than the discharge bill.”
Wednesday’s vote was non-binding, as the Oversight Committee is free to continue its probe without floor auction which Politico reported. House GOP leadership argues it’s a better option than Massie’s legislation, which would compel release of unclassified materials from the Epstein case within 30 days. 
Massie’s effort comes after the U.S. Department of Justice in July released an unsigned memo declaring “a systemic review revealed no incriminating ‘client list,’” and department and FBI officials concluded that “no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.”
House GOP leadership is trying to appease Republicans who want more information released. Accusers of Jeffrey Epstein held a press conference on Wednesday calling for the release of all materials. The accusers suggested that they could release their own client list. 
“The truth needs to come out, and the government holds the truth,” U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, said during Wednesday’s conference with Epstein’s accusers. “The cases that are sealed hold the truth. Jeffrey Epstein’s estate holds the truth. The FBI, the DOJ and the CIA hold the truth.”
President Donald Trump has called the Epstein discussion a “Democrat hoax that never ends.” The White House views the discharge petition as “a very hostile act.” 
“Helping Thomas Massie and Liberal Democrats with their attention-seeking, while the DOJ is fully supporting a more comprehensive file release effort from the Oversight Committee, would be viewed as a very hostile act to the administration,” a White House official told CNN.
The Trump administration has been criticized by some in the GOP base and by congressional Democrats for a lack of transparency surrounding Epstein, after some Trump-picked agency heads raised expectations about what would be released related to the deceased sex offender, who died in prison in 2019 while facing sex trafficking charges. 
Massie, the Kentucky Republican, has only three other House Republicans who have signed his petition.  The rest are House Democrats; Massie would need two more GOP members to sign on to allow him to bypass leadership and get his bill on the floor. 
The three Republicans publicly supporting his effort are South Carolina U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert and Georgia’s Taylor Greene.

,DC,2025-09-03 21:34:29+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Despite shutdown deadline, little movement in Congress on spending deal","Jennifer Shutt, Shauneen Miranda",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/despite-shutdown-deadline-little-movement-congress-spending-deal,,"WASHINGTON — Members of Congress began searching for compromise on a short-term government funding bill Wednesday, with just a few weeks left to broker a deal before a possible shutdown.Fresh off their August recess, congressional leaders and members of the Appropriations Committee appealed for bipartisanship from the other side while admitting they are far from a final agreement. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., declined to say during a press conference whether he will negotiate a stopgap spending bill with Democrats, or use the go-at-it-alone approach that succeeded in March. “Republicans are committed to keeping the government open, and unfortunately, it seems like not all Democrats agree with that, and they're beginning to apply the government shutdown pressure,” Johnson said. “But I want you to remember one thing: All but one House Democrat voted to shut down the government in March, and we expect, sadly, that that may happen again.”Johnson said he was open to negotiations with Democratic leaders as long as they “are willing to work with us and think responsibly about how we can spend less than we did last year.”Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said during an afternoon press conference that Democrats want GOP leaders to negotiate the stopgap spending bill across party lines. “The bottom line is very simple: We Democrats want a bipartisan bill and we are pushing the Republicans very hard to do it,” Schumer said. “We’re on our front foot. We’re unified.” Schumer, who took considerable flak for helping Republicans limit debate on a partisan stopgap bill in March, said “it’s much different than last time.” Pressed by several reporters about what Democrats would help move through the Senate this time around, Schumer said: “We are willing to sit down and negotiate a bipartisan proposal with significant Democratic input. So far, they are not.”Spending running on autopilotThe House and Senate are supposed to complete work on the dozen annual government funding bills by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1 but that hasn’t happened for decades, so lawmakers rely on a stopgap spending bill to keep federal departments and agencies running on autopilot for a couple months. That measure, sometimes called a continuing resolution, is intended to give lawmakers a bit more time to complete bipartisan House-Senate negotiations on the full-year appropriations bills, though Congress used three CRs to fund the government this fiscal year instead of getting its work done. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he expects lawmakers will need to approve a stopgap spending bill “for some time into the foreseeable future,” but that discussions are ongoing about how long it will last and what else might be added. “My hope would be that whatever that CR looks like, that it is clean and that it enables us to buy some time to get a regular appropriations process done,” Thune said. “I still think the best way to fund the government is through the appropriations process.”President Donald Trump said from the Oval Office earlier in the day that he expects Republicans will vote for a stopgap spending bill but he didn’t address how it would get through the Senate's 60-vote legislative filibuster, which requires bipartisanship. “I think the Republicans will vote for an extension,” Trump said. “We won’t have any Democrat votes."" Three spending bills seen as possibleHouse Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., told reporters he hopes to negotiate final versions of three full-year bills with the Senate before the end of the month.Lawmakers would then use a stopgap spending bill to keep the departments and agencies covered in the other nine bills flat funded for a couple of months until the two chambers can reach final agreement on the spending levels and policy within those measures. “We’re talking about relatively modest bills and bills where there is either broad agreement, like MilCon-VA, or LegBranch and Ag,” Cole said. “We’re not talking about major bills. You can’t really do that until you have a topline and we don’t have a topline.”The Agriculture-FDA, Legislative Branch and Military Construction-VA spending bills are generally easier to negotiate than some of the other full-year measures, like Defense, Homeland Security and Labor-Health and Human Services-Education. Cole said when House and Senate leaders begin negotiating a total spending level for all of the bills, or topline, is “above my paygrade.”“I’m ready to do it at any time if they want to empower us, otherwise the leadership on both sides and the president have to” figure that out, Cole said.The House and Senate are supposed to start off the annual government funding process in the spring by reaching bipartisan agreement on how much in total spending to spread throughout the dozen appropriations bills. Those talks haven’t even started for fiscal 2026, which is slated to begin Oct. 1. Instead, the House and Senate Appropriations committees have separately decided how much to spend and written vastly different versions of the bills. House and Senate at oddsThe 12 bills that have been released by the GOP-led House committee are partisan, while the eight bills released by the Senate panel have received broad bipartisan support in committee. Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she’s spoken with Cole a couple of times about the three-bills-plus-stopgap strategy and supports the concept. “I have and I agree with that approach,” Collins said.Washington state Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, said any stopgap bill “needs to be a real bipartisan compromise.”“For the last few months we have shown a bipartisan way forward on the Appropriations Committee,” Murray said. “Democrats have shown that we are willing to work in good faith to write bipartisan funding bills that protect investments in education, life-saving research and a lot more. “We’ve already passed eight out of the committee and three on the floor: MilCon-VA, Ag and LegBranch. As part of a bipartisan short-term CR, I support conferencing those three bills and passing them with the short-term CR for the remaining nine bills.”House Appropriations ranking member Rosa DeLauro said “the best case scenario for us is to move forward.” “No gimmicks, no riders, let's clear the decks,” the Connecticut Democrat said. “Talk about how we get Republican priorities, Democratic priorities.” Negotiations ‘for weeks now’House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said “there’s a chance” to wrap up negotiations between the two chambers on final versions of some of the full-year government spending bills before the end of the month. “It might not be all 12, but a few of them for sure,"" Scalise said. ""So let's give the appropriators that opportunity to keep negotiating. They've already been having negotiations for weeks now — Tom Cole and a lot of his counterparts. I have faith they can hopefully get a lot of things done.”Scalise, R-La., said he plans to reserve floor time later this month to  ensure whatever spending bill gets written is “the top priority.”Rep. Robert Aderholt, chairman of the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee, said he thinks most people agree there’s going to be some sort of stopgap given all 12 of the annual bills aren’t close to becoming law.The Alabama Republican said this feat is “almost impossible” given the short number of legislative days left before the shutdown deadline. “The solution, of course, obviously, or the only alternative, would be to have a CR, but I think the shorter the CR, the better,” he said, noting that the measure would have to be “long enough that you can have negotiations, but short enough that it doesn’t drag out until Christmas and that ... we’re up here at Christmas doing an omnibus or something like that, which everybody wants to avoid.” Congress has often bundled the final, conferenced versions of the dozen bills together into a sweeping omnibus package at the end of the year to ensure quick floor votes, though GOP leaders have tried to get away from that practice in recent years. Rep. Chuck Edwards, a North Carolina Republican who sits on the House Appropriations Committee, said that while he hopes a stopgap spending bill is “not necessary,” the panel is “certainly prepared to put together a short-term CR if that's what’s required to avoid a shutdown.”",,,,2025-09-03 17:58:16.771169

(Image courtesy U.S. Forest Service)Montana’s Department of Environmental Quality on Tuesday denied a petition to weaken Lake Koocanusa’s standard for selenium, a pollutant stemming from Canadian coal mines that can have adverse effects on fish and wildlife.
The Lincoln County Commission submitted the rulemaking petition challenging the current site-specific standard of acceptable selenium concentration of 0.8 micrograms per liter of water, a more stringent threshold than the federal standard of 1.5 micrograms per liter. The commissioners asked DEQ to align with the federal standard, saying it was in the best interest of the county.
In a phone call with the Daily Montanan on Wednesday, Commissioner Noel Duram said he was disappointed in DEQ’s decision, but wanted to continue working with the department on the issue.
“We might be disagreeing with how things work, but we both have a goal to provide a safe environment for our community,” Duram said.
During an Aug. 14 public hearing, Duram said the standard affected Lincoln County specifically, by limiting additional discharge into Lake Koocanusa. He said the economic interests of the county would be stymied by such a stringent standard, which could prevent companies from investing in industries, such as mining, but DEQ rejected that argument.
“Fishing and recreational tourism on Lake Koocanusa and the Kootenai River downstream generates significant revenue and jobs in Lincoln County and elsewhere, as supported by public comments,” according to DEQ’s statements rejecting the petition, which said the commissioners provided no evidence of economic hardship under the stricter standard.
And while representatives from Elk Valley Resources and the North American Selenium Working Group wrote letters in support of a weaker standard, the overwhelming sentiment of the public was for keeping it as is.
Nearly a dozen opponents to the petition pushed back against Duram’s comments at the hearing, claiming Koocanusa had some of the worst selenium contamination in the world and continued acceptance of high levels of pollutants would negatively impact the lake’s clean water and aquatic life.
“Selenium is a scary element, and we’re not talking about a little bit of pollution here,” said Derf Johnson, deputy director for the Montana Environmental Information Center, during the hearing.
MEIC praised DEQ’s ruling in a press release as a “clean water victory,” adding that the organization would continue to defend the protective standards.
In DEQ’s rejection of the petition, the department stated the commissioners “did not provide sufficient evidence to support their proposed rule amendment,” citing data from federal researchers showing the high concentration of selenium in fish.
Selenium is a mineral often found in coal-rich deposits. While the element is an essential nutrient for animals, it is toxic in high concentrations and high accumulations in fish can lead to growth inhibition, reproductive defects and increased mortality.
Upstream of Lake Koocanusa along the Elk River, four active mountaintop-removal metallurgical coal mines are operated by Elk Valley Resources, a subsidiary of Swiss mining conglomerate Glencore. The mining operations have leached various pollutants into the Elk River, including selenium and nitrates, according to multiple studies spanning more than a decade.
Montana instigated its site-specific rule in 2020, and it the standard has been embroiled in litigation on both sides of the border and attempts by Montana officials to revert to the looser, federal standard.
But opposition to further change bas been strong.
The Department of Environmental Quality also received nearly 200 public comments urging DEQ to reject the petition and keep the stricter standard, including from the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, and several federal agencies.
“The transboundary Kootenai watershed sits entirely within transboundary Ktunaxa territory and provides critical habitat for rare and threatened fish species including bull trout, burbot, westslope cutthroat trout, and endangered Kootenai River white sturgeon. Unabated selenium inputs from the Elk Valley mines into Koocanusa Reservoir demonstrate a clear, increasing trend dating back to 1985,” wrote Michael Dolson, Tribal chairman of the CSKT, which is part of five Tribal governments comprising the Ktunaxa Nation. “Selenium leaching from the mines in the Elk Valley of British Columbia is resulting in degradation of water quality and presenting unacceptable impairment and risks to CSKT and Ktunaxa resources.”
Representatives from the Idaho Conservation League also weighed in during the public hearing and with written comments, asking the state to protect the downstream Kootenai River that winds through northern Idaho.
“So much selenium is contaminating Lake Koocanusa that after it is released through Libby Dam and flows downriver into Idaho, it has caused the Kootenai River in Idaho to be designated as impaired with selenium under the Clean Water Act,” said Jennifer Ekstrom, the League’s North Idaho Director. “We are writing to urge you to once again stand up for Montana, and for Idaho, by rejecting this ill-founded petition.”
The Lincoln County petition argued that in addition to potential economic impacts to the county, the data from fish tissue and ovary samples tested for selenium in recent years did not accurately represent the pollutant’s concentration and were not consistent with state and federal tissue sampling procedures.

But researchers with the U.S. Geological Survey submitted comments showing that “In short, these data showed that during the time of sampling (2020 and 2021), fish ovary selenium concentrations often exceeded the Montana Kootenai/Koocanusa fish egg/ovary selenium criterion,” for two fish species, with selenium concentrations in the water found to be higher than the current 0.8 standard.
Further data collected downstream of Libby Dam showed selenium concentrations in a majority of fish sampled also exceeded selenium criterium “even though selenium concentrations in river water were consistently less than the proposed criterion of 1.5 micrograms per liter,” the USGS letter states.
Duram said one his biggest problems with the decision to keep the strict standard is that areas of Lake Koocanusa current exceed the site-specific standard.
“Setting a standard that is vastly lower than the existing level is insane,” Duram said. “If they’re going to set a lower standard, I think they’re obligated to fix it.”
He also pushed back against environmental groups which he said were spreading misinformation about how polluted the waters are, saying the lake “isn’t compromised.”
Selenium pollution in Lake Koocanusa has been a concern for both countries and tribal nations in the area for years, with the transboundary Ktunaxa nation raising concerns about water quality in 2012 and the British Columbian government subsequently ordering the mining companies to stabilize and reduce contaminants leaching into the Elk River.
Last year, the International Joint Commission, an organization created by the United States and Canada to resolve disputes related to shared waterways, convened a board of experts to study the issue of transboundary pollution in the Elk-Kootenai River Basin. The commission’s plan of study, released in March, outlines a series of objectives for the board including collecting and analyzing data on water quality and pollutants, determining impacts to ecosystems and human health, and identifying possible mitigation and remediation efforts.
A preliminary report is expected this fall with a final report to the IJC provided in September 2026.
Due to the international efforts to study the pollutants in Lake Koocanusa and nearby waterways, the federal Environmental Protection Agency recommended the state of Montana “consider whether it is appropriate to make any potential revisions to the Lake Koocanusa selenium criterion at this time given these efforts are still underway and may result in newly developed information,” according to agency comments. “Both the IJC and ENV efforts could help inform DEQ on selenium data, information, and science for Lake Koocanusa.”
The Department concurred with that assessment, writing in their decision “it would be premature” to make any changes before that work is done.
Duram added that the commissioners are not likely to submit another petition, but will hope the triennial review conducted by DEQ next year and the findings from IJC will provide a better, collaborative way forward.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/stelprdb5261097-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-03 17:58:16.771169

(Screenshot/Google Maps)The owner of a century-old Westerly country club has once again been told he can’t redevelop the 120-acre property. 
Winn Properties had tried to use the state’s affordable housing laws to build 2,300 homes on the site but the town’s planning board rejected the proposal last July, a decision upheld by a Washington County Superior Court judge last week. 
In his decision, Associate Justice Jeffrey A. Lanphear ruled the board had “competent evidence” to reject the proposal to redevelop the century-old Winnapaug Country Club.
Winn Properties, which has owned the Shore Road country since 2021, proposed leveling the 18-hole public course in order to build 90 three-story buildings — 30% of which would be reserved for low and middle-income residents. 
Nicholas Scola, who owns Winn Properties with his wife Jill, had previously proposed turning the country club into a golf resort, plans that were shot down by the Town Council in 2022.
On Wednesday, Scola referred comment on the Superior Court’s ruling to their attorney, Matthew J. Landry. Landry did not immediately respond to inquiries from Rhode Island Current.
Winn Properties sought to make use of the state’s Low and Moderate Income Housing law, which limits the ability of municipalities to block high-density projects if less than 10% of the community’s residences qualify as affordable, in order to get the project off the ground.
Westerly’s affordable housing stock sat at around 6.45% as of 2024, according to data compiled by RIHousing, the quasi-state agency that finances affordable home construction.
The proposal was submitted to the town in December 2023 and quickly generated pushback from residents, including representatives from the local group Keep Westerly Green, over the magnitude of the development and potential strain on town infrastructure and services.
“The long-range plan for the town did not include this kind of development,” Ed Rossomando, a member of Keep Westerly Green’s executive committee, said in an interview Wednesday.
The planning board had a similar stance when it unanimously rejected Winn Properties’ plan at its July 16, 2024 meeting. The board agreed that the town needed more affordable housing, but that it should not be done with an “overproduction” of large-format multi-family structures in a single area.
The board also argued that Winn Properties’ proposal failed to offer a variety of housing options and the plans did not reflect the character of the neighborhood which consists of single-family homes overlooking Winnapaug Pond.
“A massive program of redevelopment, with a giant bump in residential density, such as the proposed development is contrary to the town’s public interests and needs,” then-Chairman Justin Hopkins wrote in the board’s formal denial.
Winn Properties appealed the board’s rejection in Superior Court on July 30, 2024 — as is allowed under laws passed in 2023 creating a dedicated land use docket in the Superior Court.
In its appeal, Winn Properties argued the board’s decision was improper and “erroneous,” citing the town’s severe shortage of low- and moderate-income housing. But Lanphear disagreed, writing that the state’s housing production law does not require the planning board to approve any and all projects that come their way.
“Surely, the planning board does not serve to rubber stamp an application,” Lanphear wrote. “Even though it requests affordable housing — the planning board is charged with applying its reasoned discretion.”
Town Solicitor William Conley Jr. did not immediately respond to comment on the ruling.
Rep. Samuel Azzinaro, a Westerly Democrat whose district includes the country club, also stood by the planning board’s decision. He said in an interview Wednesday that a dense development is “not the right fit,” particularly near Winnapaug Pond.
“I would be scared to death of septic systems that would have to be put in to take care of these things,” he said.
Azzinaro also lamented the potential loss of the town’s only public golf course, which he said remains popular with both residents and tourists.
“You go by there on a Sunday morning and the parking lot is overflowing with cars,” he said.
Rossomando told Rhode Island Current he was “cautiously optimistic” saying there is always the potential for Winn Properties to appeal to the state Supreme Court or come back to town officials with another proposal.
“We don’t know that this is the end of the story,” Rossomando said.

Wyoming Game and Fish retirees and conservation groups say the state agency's planned shrinkage of a protected corridor runs counter to science-based wildlife management. 
The post Wyoming appeases stockgrowers, trims Red Desert and southwestern Winds from ‘Path of the Pronghorn’ appeared first on WyoFile .","Proposed pronghorn migration corridor protections flowing by Jim Magagna’s west slope Wind River Range ranch didn’t look right to the longtime livestock industry lobbyist. 
Two portions of the Sublette Pronghorn Migration Corridor —  the “Red Desert” and “East of Farson” segments — were “basically separate,” “much shorter,” lacked bottlenecks and “don’t have any of the same risks” as the other eight segments traversed by the long-studied Green River Basin pronghorn herd, Magagna told WyoFile.
“If they need a formal designation — which I tend to think they probably don’t — that ought to be a separate process,” said Magagna, executive vice president of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association.

In public meetings, a formal comment letter and in conversations with “various people at the top,” Magagna let it be known that he wanted the 270,000-plus acres dropped and not designated as a migration path. That’s about one-tenth of the proposed corridor’s overall acreage. The request, he said, was not based on the migration paths going through his ranch and federal land grazing allotments. 
On Tuesday, the public learned that Magagna is in line to get his wish. 
The Game and Fish Department outlined its current proposal ahead of next week’s Wyoming Game and Fish Commission vote on whether to advance the state’s first protected pronghorn corridor. If approved, the commission’s recommendation would then go to Gov. Mark Gordon — the next step in a politically fraught process that’s been going on for six years and counting. 

Wyoming Game and Fish Department officials are no longer recommending the designation of two southeastern segments formerly considered part of the Sublette Pronghorn Herd’s migration corridor, illustrated in this map. The segments would be “identified,” but not “designated” and not afforded policy protections if Game and Fish commissioners agree to the change. (WGFD)
One document shows that the state wildlife agency no longer wants to designate the “Red Desert” and “East of Farson” segments as part of the migration corridor. The recommendation doesn’t mention Magagna’s input, instead citing a lack of “high-use” habitat in the area, no bottlenecks and “limited threat levels” as the rationale for dropping two of the pronghorn corridor’s ten segments. 
Game and Fish officials couldn’t be reached Tuesday or Wednesday morning for an interview. 
Rich Guenzel, a retired Game and Fish biologist who personally endowed a pronghorn-specific conservation fund, sees the move as detrimental to pronghorn. 
“My recommendation to the commission is that they go with the biology,” he told WyoFile. “This is your opportunity to get the best [outcome] for wildlife. We shouldn’t water it down on our own, we should take our best shot.”

Guenzel, who’s a member of the Wyoming Outdoor Hall of Fame, pointed out an “area working group,” which will include industry representatives, has yet to convene and will have an opportunity to tinker with the migration protection proposal stemming from the state agency’s science-based assessment. Then the actual decision will be made by Gov. Mark Gordon or a future governor, he said. 
“If it’s going to be a political decision,” Guenzel said, “let the politicians own it.”
The Wyoming Game and Fish Commission has shown some appetite for shooting down politically influenced wildlife management proposals from its department. In July, the governor-appointed body reversed planned hikes in hunting quotas for mountain lions in the Laramie Mountains. 
“If it’s going to be a political decision, let the politicians own it.”rich guenzel
At least one conservation group that has tracked the sluggish implementation of Wyoming’s migration policy voiced similar concerns to Guenzel. Greater Yellowstone Coalition staffer Jared Baecker said he supports Game and Fish’s earlier inclusion of all 10 migration segments, which used data from over 600 GPS-collared pronghorn tracked over two decades. 
“The Wyoming Game and Fish Department’s data has demonstrated the importance of the East Farson and Red Desert segments to pronghorn survival during the winter of 2022/2023,” Baecker wrote in an email. “Excluding these areas from designation goes against the North American model of including the best-available science in wildlife management.” 
The Game and Fish commission will also consider authorizing some additions to the proposed pronghorn corridor. The tacked-on areas stem from 54 animals fitted with GPS collars between fall 2022 and this spring, and include 5,900 acres of “high use” corridor, 29,000 acres of “medium use” corridor and 119,000 acres of “low use” habitat. 

Continued monitoring of the Sublette Pronghorn Herd has tentatively added  tens of thousands of acres of habitat to the proposed migration corridor. New acreage is in red. (WGFD)
The added habitat is a drop in the bucket relative to the expanse of the overall migration corridor, which was sized up at 2.6 million acres — larger than Yellowstone National Park — prior to the planned removal of the “Red Desert” and “East of Farson” segments, which would lop off the 270,000-plus acres. 
Although the corridor covers a lot of ground, only its bottlenecks, totalling 27,375 acres, would be subject to rigid policies governing surface-disturbing activities. And nearly half of the bottleneck acreage would be exempt from protections because it occurs on private land, which isn’t subject to restrictions imposed by Wyoming’s migration policy. 
Wyoming’s migration policy has been ballyhooed and called one of the first and most robust forays into the conservation of wildlife migration. But the current policy — in 2019, due to controversy, it was updated and codified as an executive order under Gordon — has still never been used to designate a corridor in a state where dozens have been scientifically mapped. The Sublette Pronghorn Herd’s migration is the first attempt.
At 8:30 a.m. Sept. 10 in Lander, the Game and Commission is scheduled to vote on whether Gordon or a future governor should formally designate the state’s first migration corridor under the new policy.

A Michigan man pleaded guilty on Wednesday to a felony charge that he voted twice during last year’s August primary election.
Prosecutors said Frank Prezzato, 68, of St. Clair Shores, voted using his absentee ballot and then showed up at his polling place and voted there as well.
A news release from Attorney General Dana Nessel said Prezzato “acknowledged that he acted recklessly.” As part of a plea agreement, he will serve six months of delayed probation. After that, the charges can be dismissed with prejudice — closing the case permanently — if Prezzato meets the conditions of his probation. His formal sentencing is set for the end of October.
“Voting twice undermines our democratic process,” Nessel said. “My office will continue to prosecute those who violate our voting laws to ensure Michigan voters have confidence in the integrity of our elections.”
In total, Nessel’s office pursued charges against seven people in the scandal — four voters and three poll workers. Five of those people, including the poll workers, have since had charges against them dismissed, including one man whose attorney argued he had been entrapped by the government.
The other remaining defendant, Stacey Kramer, could have a jury trial as soon as this month, according to court records.
In all four cases of alleged double-voting, officials say both votes were counted. Still, double voting is extremely rare in Michigan and across the country.
In Michigan, several safeguards are in place to prevent double voting before it occurs. The most significant is the use of e-pollbooks — computers that poll workers use to check voters in at polling places. These systems flag when a voter has already submitted an absentee ballot, so they don’t get a second one. If a voter who shows up to vote at a polling place has an outstanding absentee ballot that has not yet been returned, the e-pollbooks prompt election workers to arrange to cancel it before issuing an in-person ballot.
In the rare instance that it does happen, double voting is usually a matter of timing — the in-person vote is cast before the absentee ballot is received and input by election officials. In that case, officials are notified while processing the absentee ballot that an in-person ballot was cast. In the St. Clair Shores cases, prosecutors alleged that the appropriate warnings did come up, but that poll workers overrode them and issued in-person ballots anyway, allowing two ballots to be cast by the same person.
Macomb County Prosecutor Pete Lucido initially declined to press charges against any of the people involved in the St. Clair Shores case. He argued that it appeared no one had intended to commit a crime.
But two months later, Nessel filed charges not only against those accused of casting two ballots but also against the poll workers who allegedly assisted them. At the time, the move was viewed as part of a broader effort by Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to underscore the security of Michigan’s elections ahead of the 2024 presidential race.

The Centers for Disease Control, the nation’s top public health agency, is in chaos following the firing of its director by President Donald Trump and the resignations of its top leaders last week. Nine former CDC directors wrote in the New York Times this week that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, who spearhead the purge of the CDC and is a longtime leader of the anti-vaccine movement, is “endangering every American’s health.”
States are increasingly spurning Kennedy and taking health matters into their own hands. Northeastern states, including Vermont, have formed a regional health coalition in response to concerns about federal vaccine guidance. The governors of California, Washington and Oregon declared this week said that the CDC has become “a political tool that increasingly peddles ideology instead of science … that will lead to severe health consequences.” The three western states are banding together to coordinate their own vaccine policy.
Meanwhile, the state of Florida has just announced that it will become the first state to do away with all childhood vaccine mandates, eliciting strong objections from public health experts.

Can Vermont trust the health advice coming out of the federal government? What are the leading threats to public health confronting the state and country?
“It pains me to say, I don’t know that you want to trust the CDC,” said Dr. Becca Bell on The Vermont Conversation. Bell is associate professor of pediatrics at the Larner College of Medicine and a pediatric critical care physician at the University of Vermont Children’s Hospital. She is the immediate past president of the Vermont Medical Society and of the Vermont Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. (Bell noted that she is speaking in her personal capacity, not on behalf of the organizations with which she is affiliated).
Bell said that “the officials that have left the (CDC) have really raised the alarm that … we shouldn’t trust what’s coming out of the CDC in terms of some immunization guidance in particular.”
She encouraged families to look to other sources for accurate information, especially the parenting website of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which represents 67,000 pediatricians. She also recommended the Vermont Department of Health and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
“Then I ask families to talk to their own child’s doctor, because that’s going to be a great source as well.” 
Kennedy, the Health and Human Services secretary, announced in May that the CDC would no longer recommend a COVID shot for healthy children. The American Academy of Pediatrics has issued contrary guidance, recommending a COVID shot for all children under the age of 2 since they are “especially vulnerable to severe COVID-19.”
Bell credited Vermont with being proactive “about how we can keep Vermonters safe,” but added  that she feels “really sad” for the future of child health in the United States. “I think that we’re going to see a lot of disparities, not just with access to vaccination but access to health care in general, with the big Medicaid cuts that are coming up as well.”
Bell warned that Medicaid cuts, which will result in some 45,000 Vermonters losing health insurance, will fall hardest on children. One third of Medicaid enrollees in Vermont are children.
“What we’re about to see with that One Big Beautiful Bill Act (is) a huge transfer of resources from low income folks to the highest earners in this country,” said Bell. “Accessible, affordable health care is what kids need to succeed and for families to succeed, and so we are deeply concerned about the future of pediatric health care because our foundation is Medicaid. This is how we care for kids. It’s what supports our clinics.”
“The lack of investment in children is just really concerning and very short sighted.”

(Capitol News Illinois illustration by Andrew Adams)
Article Summary

The Trump administration has demanded Illinois turn over its complete statewide voter registration database, including sensitive information such as voters’ dates of birth, driver’s license and Social Security numbers.
The Illinois State Board of Elections has given DOJ a redacted data set that does not include sensitive information, but it says state privacy laws preclude it from sharing the unredacted database.
DOJ says it wants the information to determine whether Illinois is complying with federal requirements to keep its voter rolls accurate and up to date.
A former Justice Department attorney who now runs the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research says the DOJ has no legal authority to demand the information.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

SPRINGFIELD – The Illinois State Board of Elections said this week it will not hand over to the Trump administration a copy of the state’s complete, unredacted voter registration database, citing state laws that require the agency to protect voters’ sensitive personal information.
In a letter Tuesday to the Voting Section of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, ISBE general counsel Marni Malowitz said releasing the data would expose Illinois voters to unnecessary risks.
“We take Illinoisans’ privacy very seriously; data breaches and hacking are unfortunately common, and the disclosure of sensitive information contrary to state law would expose our residents to undue risk,” Malowitz wrote.
Illinois is reportedly one of several states that DOJ has asked to turn over entire voter registration databases, including sensitive personal information such as dates of birth, driver’s license or state ID numbers, and partial Social Security numbers.
DOJ has said it wants the information in order to enforce federal requirements that states maintain accurate and up-to-date voter registration lists. But state elections officials have said they are precluded under state law from releasing sensitive information contained in the registration files.

In August, state officials sent DOJ a copy of the same type of data file it shares with political committees and other government agencies. That file includes voters’ names, addresses and their age at the time they registered, but not their date of birth, driver’s license, state ID or Social Security number.
But DOJ wrote back on Aug. 14 saying that was not good enough. It demanded the state turn over its entire database, with “all fields, including the registrant’s full name, date of birth, residential address, his or her state driver’s license number or the last four digits of the registrant’s social security number as required under the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) to register individuals for federal elections.”

As of Wednesday afternoon, the elections board had not indicated whether it had received a response from the Justice Department to its latest letter.
DOJ has said it wants the information to determine whether Illinois is complying with requirements under the 1993 National Voter Registration Act and the 2003 Help America Vote Act to keep the voter registration lists accurate and up to date. That includes occasionally purging from the voter rolls the names of people who have died or moved.

But DOJ has also asked Illinois to identify the number of registered voters who have been removed from the rolls for other reasons, such as not being U.S. citizens, being adjudicated incompetent, or for felony convictions.
David Becker, a former DOJ attorney in the voting section of the Civil Rights Division who now directs the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research, said during a media briefing Wednesday that the federal agency has only limited authority to enforce the list maintenance requirements of those laws.
“The DOJ has sole authority to require that the states engage in a general, reasonable program of list maintenance,” he said. “What the DOJ can’t do is say, ‘Remove Jane Doe, but keep John Doe on.’ That is the role of the states and states alone.”
He also said the department has no legal authority to demand voters’ sensitive personal information and it would have little use for the information even if it could have access to it.
“The DOJ could not possibly, even if they had it, conduct better list maintenance than the states are currently doing,” he said. “The most valuable asset that (states) have is their DMV database, which the federal government does not have access to. So even if they had a legal authority to gain this data, it wouldn’t do them any good, and they don’t have the legal authority to get this data.”

Mike Braun speaks at a news conference on Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun has lifted a longtime utility customer advocate to the state’s top job — and directed her to find ways to cut bills.
Two members of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission also have announced plans to resign early, handing Braun more opportunities to impact utility rates. They join a third whose term has already lapsed.
“Hoosiers have been burdened with utility rate increase after increase. We can’t take it anymore,” Braun said in a Wednesday news release. His chief of staff told reporters that the governor will be focusing on energy and energy rates this fall.
Abby Gray (Courtesy Office of Utility Consumer Counselor)
Braun appointed Abby Gray to run the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor on Tuesday, according to the agency’s website. The 92-year-old office serves as utility customers’ legal and technical representative in IURC rate cases and matters.
Gray previously spent more than 16 years directing legal operations for the agency, per the website. Before that, she served 23 years as a senior administrative law judge and senior commission counsel for the IURC.
“I have dedicated my career to public service and it’s the honor of a lifetime to continue to serve Indiana ratepayers in this new role,” Gray said. “I am deeply humbled and appreciative of Governor Braun’s confidence in me and look forward to advocating for Indiana utility consumers.”
Former Counselor William Fine left his longtime post last week.
Braun also directed Gray to evaluate utility companies’ profits and look at other cost-saving measures to “ease the burden on ratepayers.”
“I would also like to see the utilities’ investors bear more of the cost of doing business,” he added, pointedly.
That’s the IURC’s realm.
Changes coming for utility regulators
When regulated utilities want to hike customer bills, they go to the commission for permission. The IURC can also regulate construction projects, asset acquisition, financing, bonding, environmental compliance plans, service territories and more.
While Gray and the OUCC explicitly represent Hoosiers, the commission is “an advocate of neither the public nor the utilities,” according to its website. It is supposed to ensure utilities provide safe, reliable service at just and reasonable rates.
Indiana’s “big five” investor-owned electricity providers are monopolies in their exclusive service territories.
Gubernatorial candidate Braun promised that, as seats on the IURC “become open,” he’d add appointees that “hold my views on the future of energy in Indiana.” Now, as governor, he has vacancies to fill.
IURC Chair Jim Huston’s current term ended in April. Without a replacement named, he’s continued serving. The terms for Commissioners Sarah Freeman and Wesley Bennett were set to end early next year, but both announced plans on Wednesday to resign in October.
In a news release, Freeman said she was “honored” to have spent nine years as a commissioner, and thanked Huston for his leadership.

Bennett called it a “blessing” to have served Hoosiers alongside his commission colleagues for the last two years.
Both have notified Braun of their intent to step down, according to the release, “ensuring time for the IURC Nominating Committee to open applications and fill the vacancies by their resignations.”
The administration says it wants the IURC to give more scrutiny to rate cases brought by the investor-owned utilities. New appointees will focus on ratepayers, affordability and supply.
Some lawmakers applauded Braun’s actions, but warned that Hoosier ratepayers are unlikely to see relief.
“I appreciate Gov. Braun’s stated commitment to lowering utility costs for consumers and share that desire with him,” Rep. Carey Hamilton, D-Indianapolis, said in a news release Wednesday. “… Changing the consumer ratepayer advocate commissioner does little to change the fact that the legal deck is stacked against Indiana utility consumers.”
“Thanks to a slew of new laws championed by the Republican supermajority, utility companies are still allowed to pass on the cost of expensive experimental projects to consumers, and data centers are exempt from paying sales tax,” she continued. “I hope that my House Republican colleagues will join us in advocating for consumers over utility company profits in the future, especially as consumers begin to understand that AI companies are passing on the cost of doing business to everyday families.”
Rep. Alex Burton, D-Evansville, also announced plans to file legislation aimed at lowering utility bills next session.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-03 20:57:51+00:00,CT Mirror,"Survey: CT businesses face growing uncertainty, unease amid policy shifts",P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/03/cbia-business-survey-economy-ct/,"While CBIA found business opinions were fairly consistent from 2024, what changed in 2025 was uncertainty about state and federal policy.","As Connecticut’s economy continues to face a complex mix of challenges — ranging from rising operating costs, to difficulty filling jobs, affordability concerns and the state’s high cost of living — national and state policy changes are adding additional uncertainty to the mix, according to a new survey of businesses released on Wednesday. 
In the latest edition of the “Survey of Connecticut Businesses,” an annual survey compiled by the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, businesses across the state weighed in on a variety of topics — including federal tariff policy, the impacts of state regulation and taxes, and Connecticut’s overall business climate. 
“Employers are increasingly dealing with unnecessary uncertainty generated by both federal and state policy decisions, particularly tariffs and the pivot by Connecticut policymakers away from the fiscal guardrails and no-tax policies that brought much-needed economic stability in recent years,” Chris DiPentima, the president and CEO of CBIA, said in a statement released alongside the survey. 
“While our survey shows some signs of optimism, concerns about the state’s competitiveness, workforce challenges, and cost pressures continue to temper expectations,” he added. 
The survey was sent to 2,800 businesses across the state during the summer, with roughly 13% of businesses responding to the survey. Most of the firms were small, CBIA said, “with 68% employing less than 50 people, 13% with 50 to 99 people, 11% between 100 and 249 employees, and 8% employing between 250 and 499 people.” Overall, the report found that business opinions are widespread and are fairly consistent with the survey responses reported last year. 
What was different in 2025, however, was a growing sense of unease and uncertainty amid policy shifts at the local, national and international levels — specifically the onset of new state regulations and global tariff and trade policies. 
[RELATED: A US tariff exemption for small orders is ending. It’s a big deal for CT small businesses]
That instability, respondents noted in the survey, arrives as businesses face persistent workforce difficulties, increased expenses and frustrations with state lawmakers. But the survey also found some business leaders in the state are seeing positive signs as well, focusing on innovation and optimization as the uncertainty continues.
That duality was on display Wednesday at CBIA’s annual Connecticut Economy conference, as business leaders and economic experts unpacked the survey results, describing the current political landscape as presenting both risks and rewards. 
“Don’t count on the uncertainty going away,” Ezra Greenberg, a partner with McKinsey & Company, said while presenting regional and national economic data at the conference Wednesday morning. “We’ve been talking about this for years, so we have to think about it.”
Costs are rising, for workers and for businesses
According to the survey, Connecticut businesses are dealing with two problems in particular: an increase in business costs and a shortage of workers. 
In July, there were more than 77,000 unfilled job openings in the state — more vacancies than before the pandemic began in March 2020. 
Some 9 in 10 respondents also said that costs were increasing for a number of reasons, including labor expenses, health care, energy, taxes and compliance costs. 
Those costs make it harder for businesses to continue operating, they said, with one respondent arguing that “raising the minimum wage, workers’ compensation costs, and increasing the threshold on unemployment costs will ultimately make it unaffordable to stay in Connecticut.” 
Some respondents said policy decisions from the Connecticut legislature aggravated these difficulties. The report noted that respondents largely held neutral or negative opinions about the state Legislature when it comes to lawmakers’ handling of the economy. 
That led to a swift rebuke by GOP state senators Stephen Harding, Henri Martin and Heather Somers.
“Connecticut job creators are very concerned about what they see happening at our State Capitol, and rightly so,” the lawmakers noted in a statement released Wednesday. “Connecticut Democrats continue to overtax working families and businesses.” 
Survey respondents’ view on the issue went deeper than taxes. On a question about regulatory burdens, 45% of respondents said that Connecticut labor policies like paid sick leave and paid FMLA requirements were their biggest challenge. Another 23% cited insurance mandates and difficulty managing health care costs.

“Business leaders are navigating a complex cost landscape that directly impacts their ability to grow and compete,” the survey report noted. “At the same time, employers understand the rising costs their employees face to live in the state — leading them to find ways to increase salaries and offer other means of supporting their workforces.” 
That tension has been outlined in other recent reports.
In July, CT Voices for Children released a report arguing that addressing wage inequality — in other words, closing gaps in pay experienced largely by women, Black workers, and Hispanic workers — could help address affordability issues in the state. On Wednesday, Gov. Ned Lamont announced that Connecticut’s indexed minimum wage will increase to $16.94 in January 2026, one of the highest in the nation. 
Economic experts said Wednesday that if Connecticut hopes to be competitive regionally and nationally, it will need to find a way to thread the needle between businesses wanting lower costs and workers pushing for higher wages. 
“When you’re talking about quality of life, it’s not just quality of life, it’s for whom is the quality of life,” said Dustin Nord, director of the CBIA foundation for Economic Growth and Opportunity. “What are we doing to make it affordable for people that are at the beginning of their career, that they have opportunity and the ability to afford a nice place to live and have the amenities that they might be able to get in Charlotte, or if they go to D.C. or go to Virginia?” 
A regional – and national – competition
Wednesday also saw the release of a new CBIA foundation index comparing economic conditions in Connecticut to states across the country. 
The index report found that Connecticut is a mixed bag, ranking near the top of the nation on some measures like per capita personal income (2nd), and bachelor degree attainment (6th). But the state ranks close to the bottom on others, including job creation, where the state ranked 34th in one-year employment growth and 42nd for growth over a ten-year period. 
The ranking showed that Connecticut is struggling to keep up with more affordable states, making it harder for the state to attract new residents, keep young people after college, and support working families.

“The data reveals a state at an inflection point,” an introduction to the index report stated. “We have the educational attainment, research capacity, and income levels that typically drive economic success, and yet we’re not seeing that translate into the job creation and business formation that sustain long-term competitiveness.” 
On Wednesday, those gathered for the CBIA event acknowledged that the state is still in the process of charting its path forward. But for businesses, speakers said, at a time of heightened uncertainty and continued costs, finding support within the community will be key to moving forward.
“I think in these trying economic times, it is a time where businesses have to work together, where you have to partner,” said Robyn Sullivan, president of data recovery and cloud computing provider, Cloudsmart LLC. “There is some common ground that can be made.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CBIA_Economy_001-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-03 17:58:16.771169
,DC,2025-09-03 20:57:13+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,‘Congress must choose’: Epstein survivors demand vote to release case files,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-must-choose-epstein-survivors-demand-vote-release-case-files,,"WASHINGTON — As survivors of abuse inflicted by the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein pleaded on Capitol Hill Wednesday for the release of investigative files, Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie accused House GOP leaders of using “the oldest trick in the swamp” to avoid the issue.An unusually large crowd gathered outside the U.S. House to hear from the women, who described emotional manipulation and physical coercion, beginning as early as age 14 in some cases, at the hands of Epstein and convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell. The speakers included family of the late Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who pursued charges against Maxwell and died earlier this year by suicide.In speech after speech, the victims urged Congress and President Donald Trump to make public what federal authorities uncovered about the reach of Epstein’s abuse, and specifically voiced support for Massie’s bipartisan effort that would bypass House leadership and force the release of volumes of records.“Congress must choose — will you continue to protect predators, or will you finally protect survivors?” said Lisa Phillips, who was victimized by Epstein on his private Caribbean island and now hosts a podcast about healing after abuse. The government’s investigation into Epstein’s widespread sexual abuse has dogged and splintered House Republicans since July, when Trump’s administration declared it would not share any further information on the powerful and well-connected financier. Epstein died in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on federal charges of sex trafficking minors. Epstein surrounded himself with celebrities and politicians, including Trump and former President Bill Clinton. Trump campaigned on releasing what he and many describe as the “Epstein files,” and for years many of his supporters, including some now in his administration, fixated on conspiracy theories about the scandal.Discharge petition roils House“There are real victims to this criminal enterprise, and the perpetrators are being protected because they're rich and powerful and political donors to the establishment here in Washington, D.C. So today, we're standing with these survivors,” Massie said at the outdoors press conference.Massie and House Democrat Ro Khanna of California need just two more Republican signatures on a discharge petition that would trigger the release of the Epstein case file, leapfrogging House leadership.

House Speaker Mike Johnson instead urged his party Wednesday to support a symbolic measure approving an already ongoing GOP-led committee probe.Khanna, and GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, welcomed the victims to Capitol Hill alongside Massie.“This is the most important fight we can wage here in Congress, fighting for innocent people that never received justice, and the women behind me have never received justice. And do you want to know why? It's because Jeffrey Epstein somehow was able to walk among the most rich, powerful people,” Greene said.Republican Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina joined Massie and Greene in signing the petition. All Democrats in the House, which has a 219-212 split, are expected to sign.Lured by Epstein With the U.S. Capitol as their backdrop, numerous women shared stories of being lured, some at just 14 years old, by money and opportunities Epstein offered to them.Annie Farmer said she was 16 when she and her sister were flown to New Mexico to spend a weekend with Epstein and Maxwell, where she said they were assaulted and photographed. Her sister reported their sexual abuse to authorities later that year.“I am now 46 years old. Thirty years later, we still do not know why that report wasn't properly investigated, or why Epstein and his associates were allowed to harm hundreds, if not thousands, of other girls and young women. “We have never been told whether those images were found when they discovered a large amount of child sexual abuse material on his property,” said Farmer, who testified publicly in both cases against Epstein and Maxwell.Farmer said for many years it felt like Epstein’s abusive behavior was “an open secret” and that his network of powerful friends “chose to look the other way because it benefited them.” Farmer called for a thorough public review of the government’s findings in the Epstein case.“At a time with record-high levels of distrust in our institutions and a perception that there are two Americas — one for those with power and privilege and one for everyone else — passing this Epstein transparency bill is one important step that can be taken to prove to Americans that the government does not side with sexual perpetrators,” she said.Jena-Lisa Jones told the large crowd that Epstein began abusing her when she was 14.“I know that I was just a little kid, but sometimes I still feel like it is my fault that this happened,” she said.“If you’re a member of Congress and you’re listening to all of us speak here today, please really listen to us. Please vote for this bill to be passed. Please recognize how important it is for transparency relating to Jeffrey Epstein. Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, this does not matter.”Jones then directly appealed to Trump: “Please, President Trump, pass this bill and help us. Make us feel like our voices are finally being heard.” Trump rebuffs reports on Epstein relationshipTrump’s past relationship with Epstein has been under a microscope since July. The president sued the Wall Street Journal for reporting on a 50th birthday card Trump gave to Epstein. The card allegedly featured a cryptic message and a doodle of a naked woman with Trump’s signature mimicking pubic hair. The Journal also reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi briefed the president in May that his name appeared in the Epstein case files. The context in which his name appeared is unclear. Trump has denied the reports.Trump dismissed questions about releasing the Epstein case files when asked by reporters in the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon.“This is a Democrat hoax that never ends,” Trump said while sitting alongside Poland’s President Karol Nawrocki during their previously planned meeting.“What they're trying to do with the Epstein hoax is getting people to talk about that instead of speaking about the tremendous success like ending seven wars. I ended seven wars, nobody's going to talk about (that) because they're going to talk about the Epstein whatever,” Trump continued. Trump did not detail specifically which wars.“I understand that we were subpoenaed to give files, and I understand we've given thousands of pages of files, and I know that no matter what you do, it's going to keep going.”The GOP-led House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released roughly 33,000 pages Tuesday night related to the government’s Epstein investigation. But the collection was quickly dismissed by many observers as duplicates and items that were already public.“I appreciate the efforts of my colleague, James Comer, who's leading the Oversight Committee,” Massie said of his fellow Kentucky lawmaker. “They may find some information, but they're allowing the (Department of Justice) to curate all of the information that the DOJ is giving them. If you've looked at the pages they've released so far, they're heavily redacted. Some pages are entirely redacted, and 97% of this is already in the public domain.” Subpoenas issuedComer’s committee has also subpoenaed testimony from Clinton, as well as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and numerous former Department of Justice officials, from both Democratic and Republican administrations.Massie told reporters Wednesday that Speaker Johnson urged colleagues not to support the Kentucky Republican’s discharge petition and instead vote for a procedural rule to support the Oversight Committee’s investigation. A committee investigation, however, does not require a floor vote to proceed.“My message to my colleagues was, ‘Don't set yourself up.’ Yes, the speaker's resolution will give you temporary political cover, but there are millions of people watching this,” Massie said.Members of the House Oversight Committee met with several Epstein victims Tuesday.Johnson, of Louisiana, said Massie and Khanna’s petition is “moot and unnecessary.”“The Oversight Committee's investigation is already ongoing. They're already producing and putting out there the documents that are covered, the White House is in full compliance. The administration is willfully complying with the subpoenas because they want maximum transparency as well. I talked to the president himself last night, so this is going to be an ongoing effort.”Jennifer Shutt and Shauneen Miranda contributed to this report.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-09-03 17:58:16.771169

Meanwhile, Florida announced plans to become the first state to phase out all vaccine mandates, including ending requirements that kids be vaccinated against dangerous diseases before enrolling in schools.
Public health experts have relied on vaccines, including school mandates, for decades to limit the spread of communicable diseases and keep kids and adults safe.
The contrasting moves come amid turmoil at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where several top leaders resigned last week to protest efforts by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
Flanked by Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, state Surgeon General Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo said at a news conference Wednesday that vaccine mandates are “wrong” and “immoral,” the Florida Phoenix reported.
“Your body is a gift from God. What you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and your God,” Ladapo said.
“They do not have the right to tell you what you put in your body. They don’t have the right to tell you what your kids have to put in [their] body. They do not have the right. Do not give it to them. Take it away from them. And we’re going to be starting that here in Florida.”
The Florida Department of Health can eliminate some vaccine mandates on its own, Ladapo said, but the Florida legislature would have to scrap other ones. He did not mention specific vaccines, but repeated that his goal was to end “all of them. Every last one of them.”
The goal of the new West Coast Health Alliance, governors said, is to disseminate evidence-based recommendations about who should get immunized, as well as to provide vaccine education throughout the three states. In the coming weeks, the states will coordinate and finalize immunization guidelines that are in line with leading medical organizations.
In their announcements, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek and Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson criticized recent Trump administration actions, including the firing of scientists and the upheaval at the CDC.
“When federal agencies abandon evidence-based recommendations in favor of ideology, we cannot continue down that same path,” Washington Secretary of Health Dennis Worsham said in a statement.
Worsham added that “public health at its core is about prevention — preventing illness, preventing the spread of disease, and preventing early, avoidable deaths.”

Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states rely on the committee to form vaccination guidelines.
And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for children and pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19 — sidestepping the usual process for issuing official recommendations.
The three Western states said the “dismantling” of the CDC has created “a vacuum of clear, evidence-based vaccine guidance,” hampering health care providers, disrupting manufacturers’ production plans and creating uncertainty for families.
In 2020, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the three states, along with Nevada, created a similar workgroup that emphasized the scientific rigor behind the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in an effort to boost confidence in the shot.
“President Donald Trump’s mass firing of CDC doctors and scientists — and his blatant politicization of the agency — is a direct assault on the health and safety of the American people,” the joint statement from the three governors’ offices said.
“The CDC has become a political tool that increasingly peddles ideology instead of science, ideology that will lead to severe health consequences. California, Oregon, and Washington will not allow the people of our states to be put at risk.”

(Northwest Team 2 photo / Peelee Clark)A major deadline set by an Executive Order from President Donald Trump to consolidate the firefighting apparatus in the Department of Interior and the U.S. Forest Service is approaching, with some advocacy organizations hoping it will improve coordination.
Interior and the Forest Service, which is housed in the Department of Agriculture, need to present a plan by Sept. 10 on how they’re going to consolidate firefighting efforts. A second deadline, on Dec. 9, requires the two departments to unveil a plan to increase state and local firefighting capacity.
Partners in Wildfire Prevention, a coalition which includes clean energy interest groups, economic organizations, the Western Fire Chiefs Association and the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, said there’s not enough attention on the issue of wildfires at the national level. They view the order as some acknowledgement of that and are hopeful it improves fire response.
“What we don’t know yet is exactly what the decisions are that come out of the order,” said Chet Wade, a spokesperson for the group. “That’s why we think it’s important to draw attention to it. And what we hope to see is greater collaboration, stronger communication, better more effective operations.”
The order places more emphasis on using technology to fight fires. This mostly deals with early detection – computer-assisted systems can report fires, and aerial capacity, both with suppression efforts and fire reconnaissance is where more technology for managing fires could be implemented.
“There are lots of new technologies, you know, using satellites, using AI, using other sensors that allow for either monitoring and understanding when there is a higher risk and what can be done about it, or responding quickly,” Wade said.

Not all groups have been rosy about the prospect of the order, with Andy Stahl, director of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics, telling the Daily Montanan earlier this year it was just an effort to rile up members of President Trump’s base.
It’s unclear what the changes will ultimately mean to day-to-day operations. 
“At the direction of President Donald J. Trump, we are unifying federal wildfire programs to streamline bureaucracy and leverage new technologies and partnerships to better equip local responders, accelerate suppression efforts, and strengthen preventative measures—all essential to protecting communities and conserving our public lands,” Erin McDuff, an Interior Department spokesperson wrote in an email to the Daily Montanan in late June.
Montana has seen a fire season devoid of large fires. On Monday, the state’s fire tracking website said there have been 1,942 wildland fire incidents this year, but acreage burned is lower than last year. Gov. Greg Gianforte said late last month “aggressive” work by firefighters in the state had limited the acreage burned this year to about a third of what it was in 2024.
Fires across the state appeared to mostly be under control, with a spate of fires that kicked up during a warm week in late August mostly tampered down.
The Windy Rock fire, 15 miles from Drummond was the exception, which was listed at 4,130 acres and was 1% contained on Wednesday. There is a public meeting scheduled for 5 p.m. at the Helmville Community Center on Wednesday.
The fire is being managed by a large, national team. No structures have been destroyed by the fire to date.
It’s been an expensive fight, though, and the fire’s cost for suppression efforts was listed at nearly $25 million. Firefighting costs are split between state and federal governments and are divided out at the end of the year.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/306A4612-NW@-PIO-Peelee-Clark-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-03 16:57:49.720985

Vasquez of NM and members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus recently sent Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem a letter urging her to rescind policies restricting Congressional oversight of ICE detention facilities.U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.) and members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus recently sent a letter to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem expressing concern over incidents in which her agency and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement have prevented members of Congress from inspecting ICE immigrant detention facilities.
The letter contends that new DHS protocols — which require seven days’ notice for a visit, among other provisions — violate federal law and urges Noem to “immediately rescind the facility visit guidance that impedes congressional access to detention facilities and ensure full compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.”
The ICE facilities, the letter said, “are funded by billions of taxpayer dollars and exhibit persistent issues related to health and safety, human rights, and waste, fraud, and abuse. It is imperative that Members conduct timely oversight to determine whether public funds are being spent as mandated by Congress and ensure the safety and wellbeing of individuals who are detained by the government.”
Vasquez visited the Otero County Processing Center in July where, as Source previously reported, he was unable to speak with detainees; ICE officials were “unwilling and unable” to provide clear answers about their treatment of detainees; and inmate phones were broken and toilets would not flush.
Staff members for U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) visited the Torrance County Detention Facility in May, and heard at least 10 people file complaints with an ICE official for verbal and physical abuse; lack of access to laundry; being forced to wear old, dirty clothing; and lack of medical care, according to a letter Heinrich sent to Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.
“Congress needs and must be able to inspect and enforce the inspection of detention facilities,” Vasquez told Source on Wednesday. “Part of our job is oversight of federal facilities like ICE facilities, and we’re being denied that right all across the country. And so this is essentially a letter that spells out what the clear letter of the law is.”
A dozen Democratic members of the U.S. House have also gone to court over being denied access.

Ron DeSantis, speaking at Grace Christian School in Valrico on Sept. 3, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)VALRICO — Manatee County Commissioners have voted to join a lawsuit challenging a new state law (SB 180) that restricts local governments from regulating developments.
On Tuesday, they joined 10 other local governments in the state, including Orange County and the cities of Alachua and Stuart, that have joined a prospective lawsuit contending that the law is an unconstitutional infringement on home rule. They want to see it repealed.
During his press conference in eastern Hillsborough County Wednesday, the Phoenix asked the governor what he makes of local governments that say that the measure precludes them from managing growth in their communities.
“I have vetoed bills that have tried to pre-empt local [control] in the past,” DeSantis said at the end of a lengthy press conference centered on his plan end to vaccine mandates in Florida.
“I’ve signed bills that have done it. And kind of on this one the reason why I thought these people needed relief is because their home gets damaged by a major hurricane. They want to go out and restore their home to what it was like before the storm hits, and the local governments are telling them, ‘You can’t do it. You gotta do something else.’
“What right do they have to tell you that you can’t rebuild your home?” he said to a cheering crowd. “This isn’t California. This is Florida.”
The governor’s response emphasized what the bill sponsor, Pinellas County Republican Sen. Nick DiCeglie, said during the session was his motivation for the legislation: to streamline restoration efforts and improve emergency response coordination following a major storm.
The lawmaker said that he had heard from too many of his constituents in Pinellas County after the devastating one-two punch of hurricanes Helene and Milton last fall who faced roadblocks and excessive bureaucracy from local governments when trying to restore their properties.
Problematic provision
However, a provision of the proposal that was barely mentioned at all during the bill’s journey to becoming law is what is inspiring local lawmakers to pursue litigation. That provision bars new local land-use or development regulations considered “restrictive or burdensome,” even if they are completely unrelated to storm recovery.
The law also specifies that “any person” can serve a local government with notification of intent to sue on belief that the government has violated the law. The local government then has 14 days to correct any problem. If the government chooses to repeal the restriction, any case would be dropped. If it declines to repeal, that person can go ahead and file a lawsuit.
Local officials say that the phrase “more restrictive or burdensome” is hopelessly vague and/or subjective, and that it incentivizes lawyers for developers, land owners, and interest groups to challenge almost any regulatory or procedural change a local government makes.
The provision “is the largest intrusion into home rule authority of local governments since the Florida Constitution was adopted in 1968,” said Fort Lauderdale attorney Jamie Cole, who is working on filing a class action against SB 180 for the local governments later this month.
Current restrictions
Among the policies environmental groups like 1000 Friends of Florida say local governments can be restricted from enacting now because of the new law include:

Identifying appropriate locations, standards and densities for new development.
Protecting sensitive environmental and agricultural lands.
Managing water quality and supply (including stormwater).
Enhancing community resilience to lessen impacts from and costs of natural disasters.
Raising impact fees to keep up with increasing costs of infrastructure to accommodate new development.

“They may be challenging other provisions, I didn’t write the bill,” DeSantis added on Wednesday.
“There may be things in there that in a perfect world I would not have necessarily agreed to, but I did feel compelled to stand up for the homeowners who were getting stymied by local governments, and I thought that they deserved the right to be able to restore their property to where it was prior to the storm.”
“Basically what he’s saying is that he viewed this just as most of the legislators, who think that this is dealing with recovery after emergencies, after hurricanes,” said Cole. “If your house is destroyed, you want the ability to rebuild your house right away. You don’t want the government getting involved. Absolutely,” he said, laughing. “That is fine.
“The problem is this bill goes way beyond that and deals with situations that have nothing to do with hurricanes and emergencies.”

McIver from her committee assignment on the Homeland Security Committee.","Rep. LaMonica McIver (Fran Baltzer for New Jersey Monitor)House Democrats and a few Republicans killed the effort to censure a New Jersey congresswoman over her involvement in a scuffle outside a Newark migrant jail that led to federal charges. 
Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10) celebrated the failure to censure her, calling it a partisan attempt to “shut me up.” 
“I was not elected to play political games — I was elected to serve,” McIver said on social media shortly after the vote. “I won’t back down. Not now. Not ever.” 
In a 215-207 vote, the House tabled the measure, which would have also removed McIver from her committee assignment on the House Homeland Security Committee. Every Democrat voted to table the measure. They were joined by five Republicans: Reps. Don Bacon and Mike Flood of Nebraska, Rep. David Valadao of California, and Reps. Dave Joyce and Mike Turner of Ohio. Two Republicans also voted present. 
Bacon said in a statement that he didn’t support the censure of McIver because he wants the Ethics Committee to finish the report on this matter. 
Republicans lashed out at McIver after she was accused by acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba of assaulting an officer during a May 9 altercation while Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested outside Delaney Hall, an immigration detention center that opened in the city in May. Baraka saw his charges dropped weeks later. 
A federal grand jury indicted McIver on three counts of interfering with federal law enforcement authorities. McIver pleaded not guilty and maintained that the prosecution is political retaliation. Her attorneys recently asked a judge to dismiss the case against her, which is set to go to trial in November. She faces 17 years in prison if convicted.
Democratic U.S. Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman were also with McIver that day to conduct an unannounced oversight visit of the facility. Menendez and Watson Coleman did not face any charges. 
While officials read the censure resolution — introduced by Rep. Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican, before the August recess — Democrats shouted and jeered. Wednesday’s effort is the second time House Republicans have moved to reprimand a Democrat lawmaker this year — in March, 10 Democrats joined Republicans to rebuke Rep. Al Greene (D-Texas) for heckling the president during a joint address.

They are joined by AFL-CIO President Josh Sword and Education West Virginia Executive Director Kym Randolph. (Photo by Jennifer Wood/Education West Virginia)The state’s two teachers unions officially merged into one organization this month, forming a new labor union called Education West Virginia.
With public education facing funding declines, insurance hikes and teacher shortages, leaders of the West Virginia Education Association and American Federation of Teachers-West Virginia said it was the right time to come together.
“This was a thoughtful, deliberative process that was almost three years in the making, seeking to build on strengths of the former organizations while also creating a stronger, more member engaged union than ever before,” said Kristie Skidmore, co-president of Education West Virginia. Skidmore formerly served as president of AFT-WV. 
Skidmore and other co-president Dale Lee, former president of the WVEA, held a press conference Wednesday in Charleston to formally announce the merger. 
“By joining together, we will fight the challenge,” Skidmore said. 
The previous unions began discussing a merger back in 2018 during the West Virginia teachers strike, where thousands of school teachers and personnel demonstrated at the state capitol over pay and benefits. 
The merger, which went into effect Sept. 1, comes as teachers and state workers just saw a major price hike to insurance premiums under the Public Employees Insurance Agency.
Due to the program’s financial issues, the agency’s finance board approved a round of July 1 premium hikes for state and local government employees as well as retirees. Both state and county employees using PEIA saw an increase of  40% in their out-of-pocket maximum as well as increases in co-pays.The monthly spousal surcharge for state employees more than doubled, from $147 to $350. 
The increases are projected to equal roughly $113 million, but PEIA costs are expected to keep climbing due to medical inflation. 
West Virginia has the lowest teacher pay in the country. Lee said the level of salary and benefits was contributing to the hundreds of unfilled teacher jobs across the state. 
“Employees deserve affordable quality health care, and their collective voices will play an important role in driving home that message to the Legislature,” he said. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey has proposed a four-point plan to “fix” PEIA, MetroNews reported. It included: establishing a new plan for new employees; removing coverage eligibility for spouses who are offered health insurance through their own employer; and establishing a PEIA fraud unit.
The governor may call lawmakers in this month for a special session to vote on his PEIA plan, but there isn’t clear support among the GOP-super majority Legislature for Morrisey’s idea. The possible PEIA-focused special session could start as early as Sunday since lawmakers will gather in Charleston for September legislative interim meetings. 
“We have to have a long term stabilization of PEIA,” Lee said. “We know that the cost continues to increase, and we also understand that we have to have some skin in the game, but all the skin can’t be ours. It has to be everyone going to the table and coming up with a long term stabilization for this plan.”
Lee said Education West Virginia will also ask lawmakers to increase mental health support for children in schools. He noted that a new state elementary student discipline law, which mandates screening students in trouble for underlying causes, is a good start. 
“Children can’t focus on learning if they come to school hungry or stressed out or traumatized by the situations they face at home. The behavior disruptions and their violent outbursts from students are at an all time high based on what we’re hearing from our members,” he said. “It is critical that our state provide the mental health services and the resources students need.”
Lee and Skidmore will serve as co-presidents of Education West Virginia until spring 2027, when the union will have its first convention and elect a new president. 
Education West Virginia will operate under the umbrella of West Virginia AFL-CIO.
“West Virginia has a very, very rich and historic labor history … and I believe that the creation of Education West Virginia will go down in history as one of the most important and influential labor actions our state will ever see,” said West Virginia AFL-CIO President Josh Sword.
“To watch two organizations who were fiercely competitive for membership for close to 50 years put the past behind them and join together to further their common goals — for educators, for children, for communities, for public education — to be here today, celebrating this historic accomplishment, proves yet again that in solidarity, anything can be achieved,” he said.

Only around 20 lawmakers were present Wednesday afternoon when the Missouri House convened for the beginning of a special legislative session focused on changing the congressional map and making it harder for voters to amend the state constitution. 
Bills were introduced and public hearings were scheduled for Thursday. 
Rep. Emanuel Cleaver promises lawsuit if Missouri Republicans gerrymander his district

Democrats were quick to point out a quorum of 82 members is required by the constitution for the House to conduct business. And although historically the chamber has utilized “technical sessions” for routine business when a quorum is not present, House Minority Leader Ashley Aune said “that doesn’t make it legal or right.”
“The stakes are too high in this special session to allow this illegal practice to continue unchallenged,” said Aune, a Kansas City Democrat. 
Mid-decade redistricting is rare. In Missouri, it hasn’t happened since the 1960s. 
But President Donald Trump, facing a potentially difficult midterm election cycle next year, has demanded GOP-controlled states redraw maps to add more Republican seats.
Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe answered the call last week, ordering the legislature back into session to carve up one of the state’s two districts held by a Democrat.
The goal is to ensure seven of Missouri’s eight congressional districts are controlled by Republicans. In the crosshairs is the 5th District, based in Kansas City and currently held by 11-term U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. 
While eliminating a Democratic congressional seat has taken center stage, Republican lawmakers are also hoping to change the initiative petition process to require a statewide majority and a majority vote in all eight of the state’s congressional districts in order to approve a constitutional amendment. 
Currently, a simple majority is all that is required. 
The redistricting plan is being shepherded through the legislative process by state Rep. Dirk Deaton, a Noel Republican and chairman of the House Budget Committee. A special committee created by Speaker Jon Patterson will hold a public hearing Thursday at noon in the Missouri Capitol.
Another committee will hold a public hearing Thursday at 1 p.m. for the proposed changes to the initiative petition process. State Rep. Ed Lewis, a Moberly Republican, is sponsoring the legislation which, if passed by both the House and Senate, would require voter approval next year. 
The House is expected to debate and vote on both bills early next week. The Senate is scheduled to convene Wednesday to begin its work.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)Two North Dakota tribes and a group of tribal citizens formally petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court this week to review an appeals court decision that found they cannot sue the state of North Dakota for alleged voter discrimination.
The tribes say that the decision, if allowed to go into effect, would not only limit their representation in the North Dakota Legislature but be a detriment to racial equality across all seven states in the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. Private groups in these states would no longer be able to challenge state or local governments for alleged racially discriminatory voting practices. 
The tribes’ lawsuit, filed in 2022, accuses a legislative district map adopted by North Dakota lawmakers in 2021 of unlawfully diluting the power of Native American voters. The plaintiffs —  the Spirit Lake Nation, Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and three tribal citizens — claim that the map caused them to lose representation in the state Legislature.
While U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte in a 2023 ruling agreed with the tribes and in early 2024 put an alternate map in place, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned his decision in May. The appellate court concluded that the tribes do not have standing to bring the case because a law they used to bring it, known as Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, can only be enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice. Section 2 makes it illegal to limit someone’s voting rights on the basis of race.
The plaintiffs have been open about their intent to appeal this decision to the Supreme Court since early July, though Tuesday’s petition makes their request official.
“The idea that we don’t have the right to advocate for ourselves and for fair voting is undemocratic and goes against the principles that our country was founded on,” Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Chair Jamie Azure said in a Tuesday news release announcing the petition’s filing.
The state of North Dakota wants the 8th Circuit’s decision to stand. In previous court filings, attorneys for the state argued that private plaintiffs should not be allowed to destabilize state district maps. The state maintains that the 2021 map is not discriminatory.
The 8th Circuit is the only appellate circuit to rule that private plaintiffs cannot enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The court originally made this finding in a 2023 case, though the May decision reaffirmed and solidified the position.
The tribes argue that Congress had always intended for private citizens to be able to file lawsuits under the statute.
They also say the federal government cannot be counted on to police racial discriminatory voting practices on its own. The petition cites research that indicates the vast majority of cases brought under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act over the past several decades were filed by private groups like the tribes.
The U.S. Supreme Court has hinted that it may be interested in hearing the case in its upcoming term. In July, the justices agreed to prolong a temporary freeze on North Dakota’s legislative district map, which prevents the appellate court’s decision from taking effect.
This means that for the time being, voters in the 8th Circuit can still bring private lawsuits under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. It also indicates that North Dakota will likely keep Welte’s map in place for the 2026 election.
US Supreme Court to keep North Dakota district map in place until voting rights case wraps up

Background
The lawsuit concerns two voting districts in northern North Dakota — District 9 and District 15.
Before the Legislature adopted the 2021 map, District 9 followed the boundaries of Rolette County. The county includes the Turtle Mountain Reservation and in 2020 had a voting age population that was 74% Native American, according to the Tuesday petition. Richard Marcellais, former chair of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, for years represented the district in the Senate.
Redistricting happens at least every 10 years to adjust district lines following the U.S. census. In 2021, North Dakota discovered it had to change the boundaries of District 9 to meet the minimum population requirement. 
The 2021 map approved by the Legislature made District 9 bigger by adding Cavalier County and part of Towner Country. The district was also divided into two subdistricts, which each elected one representative to the House. District 9A was majority Native American and included most of Rolette County, including the Turtle Mountain Reservation. District 9B included a small portion of northern Rolette County, plus Cavalier County and most of Towner County, which made the subdistrict mostly white.
The plaintiffs argue that this made it much harder for Native voters in the district to elect leadership of their choice.
In 2022, Marcellais lost his bid for reelection, marking the first time since 1990 that there were no Native Americans serving in the Senate, the petition states. District 9 only elected one lawmaker backed by the tribes — Rep. Jayme Davis, a Turtle Mountain citizen who represented District 9A. Davis is also a Turtle Mountain citizen.
The Spirit Lake Reservation also opposed the 2021 district map. Over the objections of its leaders, it was placed in District 15, which only had a Native American voting population of about 23%, the petition states. District 15 also did not elect any candidates preferred by Native American North Dakotans in 2022, the plaintiffs argue.
The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and Spirit Lake Nation’s 2022 lawsuit argued the maps denied them proper representation and asked to be placed in the same voting district.
Welte, the North Dakota federal district judge, granted the plaintiffs’ request. His map, imposed in January 2024, places the two reservations into District 9. In the 2024 election, three Native American candidates from that district were elected to the state Legislature: Marcellais, Davis and Rep. Collette Brown, a citizen of the Spirit Lake Nation and plaintiff in the lawsuit. All three are Democrats.
Until 1922, North Dakota didn’t allow Native Americans to vote unless they “severed their tribal relations” and assimilated to white culture, according to the petition. The first Native American wasn’t elected to the state Legislature until 1970, it notes.

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)After a dozen days in limbo, state and federal officials keep ramping up the pressure on the Trump administration to let the Revolution Wind project resume. The offshore wind project already under construction south of Rhode Island was put on hold on Aug. 22, leaving workers in the lurch and risking critical energy reliability and climate change mandates.
In a Wednesday letter to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, Gov. Dan McKee outlined the consequences of the stop-work order, while asking for a meeting with President Donald Trump.
“The stop-work order undermines efforts to expand our energy supply, lower costs for families and businesses, and strengthen regional reliability,” McKee wrote to Burgum. “This action puts hundreds of well-paid blue-collar jobs at risk by halting a project that is just steps away from powering more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut.”
More than 1,000 union workers have spent much of the last two years building the 65-turbine project, 45 of which have been installed, as well as a pair of substations that will connect the power supply to Rhode Island and Connecticut. The 704 megawatts of nameplate capacity was set to be delivered by mid-2026, and already baked into the long-term plans for meeting Rhode Island’s decarbonization mandates under the state’s 2021 Act on Climate law. It is also critical to regional electrical grid reliability, especially in extreme weather events where fuel supply might be limited.
McKee spoke with Burgum on Aug. 29, with a virtual meeting among staff members for both officials earlier Wednesday, Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said in an email.
His request for a meeting with Trump comes a day before a federal court hearing in Massachusetts, where a group of 18 state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, are seeking to bar the Trump administration from blocking offshore wind projects more broadly. When the lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts in May, the Revolution Wind project did not appear in jeopardy, having already secured all of its federal and state approvals and been under construction for 18 months. Trump’s initial executive orders regarding offshore wind appeared to only affect projects still in need of federal approvals.
But that same executive order was invoked by the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in its Aug. 22 letter, ordering Danish developer Orsted to stop work on the Revolution Wind project due to national security concerns, along with environmental risks. The order left a dozen millwrights temporarily idled aboard the Wind Scylla in Rhode Island Sound, where they were working on the construction of turbines.

Millwrights return to shore
The turbine installation vessel has since returned to shore in New London, but the workers are still on board, waiting to hear if they can head back out before their four-week shift ends on Sept. 10, said Andy Benedetto, president of the Millwrights Local 1121. 
“They’re just staying on the boat so they’re ready,” Benedetto said in an interview Wednesday. “This was unplanned.”
Benedetto lamented the waste of training and jobs for local workers. Among the dozen laborers aboard the docked installation vessel is a mother-son apprentice duo, whose family depends on their incomes from the continued work, Benedetto said.
“These people are people, and it’s jobs and they were excited about this work continuing,” Benedetto said. “They had work lined up for the next couple years basically and it’s being taken away from them.”
In addition to an estimated 1,200 direct construction jobs, the project was projected to create “dozens” of long-term maintenance and operation positions filled by local union workers, according to Orsted.
Another two dozen laborers with other local unions were set to head to sea for a rotation beginning Aug. 28, but were still waiting for the call on land as of Tuesday, according to Erica Hammond, legislative director for the Rhode Island AFL-CIO. If their offshore shifts get delayed much longer, they may have to file for unemployment, depending on terms of individual contracts, Hammond said.
Democratic U.S. Reps. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island and Nikki Budzinksi of Illinois, who co-lead the Congressional Labor Caucus’ Building Trades Task Force, called on Burgum to lift the stop-work order in a joint statement Tuesday.
“Along with other clean energy projects the Administration has halted, this is yet another attack on construction workers. Secretary Burgum needs to lift the order and allow these hardworking men and women back to finish the job, provide for their families, and help achieve American energy independence,” they said.
Orsted has also pledged to explore solutions to resume work, including potential litigation, while exploring the financial implications for its $4 billion project. The company  is seeking to raise another $9.4 billion from its shareholders, with an “extraordinary general meeting” Friday to secure board approval for its share sale.
Neronha’s office is also considering additional legal action, but had not filed anything as of Wednesday. He’s focused on the existing multistate lawsuit challenging federal actions on offshore wind, scheduled for a 2:30 p.m. court hearing Thursday in Boston before U.S. District Judge William Young.

(Scott Bauer/Agriculture Research Service, USDA)Avian flu has hit turkey farms in North Dakota and South Dakota, the first cases in commercial flocks in the United States since early July. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service on Aug. 28 confirmed an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Faulk County in northeast South Dakota. The outbreak meant 55,400 birds were killed to prevent the spread of the disease.
It is the first case in a U.S. commercial flock since July 2, when the avian flu was confirmed at a game bird facility in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. 
The North Dakota Department of Agriculture said Wednesday that bird flu had been confirmed Saturday at a turkey farm in Dickey County, near the South Dakota state line. 
“After a quiet summer, it’s not unexpected that we have another case of HPAI as birds are gathering to begin the fall migration,” North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring said in a news release. 
Dr. Ethan Andress, state veterinarian in North Dakota, said 60,000 birds had to be destroyed in Dickey County. 
Andress said that because large flocks of waterfowl, such as snow geese, are not yet migrating south over the Dakotas, it may be an indication that the virus was spread from local waterfowl. 
Avian influenza exists in many wild birds and can be transmitted by contact with infected birds or through infected food and water.
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the public health risk is low but notes that avian flu also has spread to dairy cattle and humans with one human death.
In August, the avian flu also was confirmed at a live-bird market in Los Angeles County, California, and in backyard birds in St. Lawrence County, New York, according to the USDA.
The poultry industry has been combating different strains of avian influenza since 2020, according to the CDC.

New Mexico is one of three states implementing laws to restrict the use of PFAS — often called ‘forever chemicals’ — that can be found in a wide array of consumer goods and firefighting foam. (Spencer Platt / Getty Images)New Mexico will soon release an initial draft of rules to ban consumer products that contain so-called “forever chemicals,” the state’s top environment official told lawmakers Tuesday.
Earlier this year, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed House Bill 212, passed by lawmakers to institute the gradual phasing out of intentionally added per-and-polyfluouroalkyl substances in everyday items.
Lawmakers also passed a second bill, House Bill 140, to allow the New Mexico Environment Department to regulate and manage cleanup for firefighting foams containing PFAS on military bases, which have caused contamination in groundwater around the state.
“Both of these laws work together to keep PFAS out of our economy, out of our drinking water and out of people’s bodies,” Environmental Secretary James Kenney told lawmakers during an interim Radioactive Materials and Hazardous Waste interim committee meeting.
New Mexico is the third state to enshrine a ban in state laws to address the use of PFAS in consumer products, joining Maine and Minnesota. This class of manmade chemicals is often used in waterproofing and is able to withstand breaking down in water, oil and sunlight. As a result, PFAS can be found across a range of products, including cookware, takeout containers, dental floss, cleaning supplies, cosmetics, menstrual products, textiles and upholstered furniture.
But exposure through contaminated water and soil, as well as through the plants and animals, cause PFAS to build up in the human body. While still being studied, PFAS exposure is linked to increased cancer risks, fertility issues, low birth weights or fetal development issues, hormonal imbalances and limiting vaccine effectiveness.
The initial rules will be released sometime in September; require a public input process; and approval from the seven-member Environmental Improvement Board.
Once approved —potentially next summer —  the PFAS ban would roll out in phases, starting with cookware, food packaging, firefighting foams, dental floss and “juvenile products,” by January 2027. Additional items would follow, such as cosmetics, period hygiene products, textiles, carpeting, furniture and ski wax. The rules will include exceptions for PFAS used in products such as: medical devices, pharmaceuticals, electronics and cars.
Kenney said the rules will contain instructions requiring manufacturers to label products containing PFAS; establish a process for companies to receive an exemption if needed; and develop fines for companies violating the ban.
The department will also soon be releasing its draft rules on regulating firefighting foams containing PFAS, expected to receive final approval in the fall 2026. Those rules, Kenney said, will help environment officials develop a statewide inventory of the foams and determine how to characterize, treat and ultimately dispose of them.
Kenney  highlighted the recent report issued by the department finding the “fingerprint” of firefighting foam PFAS in people’s blood in Clovis, surrounding Cannon Air Force Base.
‘Forever chemicals’ detected in Clovis-area blood tests, New Mexico environmental officials say

As a result of those findings, Kenney said the department is working to spend $2 million lawmakers set aside in capital outlay to move people off of private wells and onto public drinking water systems.
Furthermore, the department plans to conduct additional testing around Holloman Air Force Base and push for cleanup as multiple federal lawsuits between New Mexico and the military remain in the courts. 
“We are going to continue to be in a groundwater war and a public health war with the Department of Defense,” Kenney said.
Sen. Ant Thorton (R-East Mountains) asked what the minimum level of exposure is safe for PFAS and what the state considered realistic.
Kenney said that he couldn’t provide an exact number “since I’m not a toxicologist,” but instead compared PFAS contamination in drinking water systems in two locations with known exposure: Curry County, near the base, and La Cieneguilla, which has detected contamination from the Santa Fe Regional Airport. 
Curry County, he said, has higher risks of exposure, as its drinking water has PFAS levels 650,000% higher than federal standards. While “not negating” La Cieneguilla’s concerns, he said, levels for that community are “much closer” to the federal standard.
“We need to figure out where the greatest risk is occurring and minimize it from there,” Kenney said. “I think many people would say there’s no acceptable risk level for PFAS, I’m a little bit more pragmatic — it’s a forever chemical. It’s going to be hard to get out of the environment, and our risk is always going to be something greater than zero.”

Robert Chamberlin and James Maxwell, two current Mississippi Supreme Court justices, testified at the Senate confirmation hearing about their nominations by President Donald Trump to lifetime judicial slots in northern Mississippi. 
Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the committee’s chairman, said the slate of nominees that appeared before the committee was full of “highly qualified men and women who understand the importance of judicial independence in our constitutional design.” 
But senators from both parties still questioned the two men about their judicial records and how they would approach the job of ruling in civil disputes and overseeing criminal trials.
Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the committee, asked Maxwell to justify the majority opinion he wrote in Nash v. State of Mississippi. In this case, the state Supreme Court upheld a lower-court judge’s sentencing of a man to serve 12 years in jail for possessing a cell phone in a correctional facility. 
Maxwell responded that the lengthy sentence may have been harsh, but his role wasn’t to impose a personal sentence on the defendant. 
“Our role as the Mississippi Supreme Court is to determine if that was a lawful sentence as set by the parameters of our state Legislature,” Maxwell responded. 
The nominees also stated at the hearing that they believed Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that ruled separate but equal segregation unconstitutional, and Loving v. Virginia, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that declared state bans on interracial marriage unconstitutional, were correct decisions. 
However, Chamberlin did not answer a similar question from Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut about whether he thought the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges recognizing a right for same sex couples to marry was a correct ruling.
“It is the better practice not to comment on the wisdom of these decisions,” Chamberlin said. 

Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Robert Chamberlin Credit: Special to Mississippi Today
Both of Mississippi’s Republican senators, Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith, spoke in support of the two nominees at the hearing. Wicker said that Chamberlin was “a rock-solid choice,” while Hyde-Smith stated she had complete confidence in Maxwell’s “qualifications, character and commitment to justice.”
Maxwell earned his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Mississippi. Former Gov. Haley Barbour in February of 2009 appointed Maxwell to the state Court of Appeals. 
Maxwell was elected to the post in 2010 and reelected in 2014. 
Former Gov. Phil Bryant appointed him to the state Supreme Court in January 2016. He was later elected to an eight-year term in November of 2016 and reelected in 2024.
Maxwell said his prior experience as a federal prosecutor and growing up with an attorney for a father helped make him qualified to become a federal judge. 
Chamberlin earned his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Mississippi. He first served as a state circuit court judge for 12 years in the 17th Circuit District. In 2016, he was elected to an open seat on the state Supreme Court and reelected in 2024. 
Before becoming a judge, Chamberlin was a member of the state Senate for five years, representing DeSoto County. 
Chamberlin, at the hearing, said his role as a state circuit court judge has prepared him to preside over a federal courtroom because he’s previously had to “run a docket” in a state court. 
Chamberlin and Maxwell will replace U.S. District Judges Michael Mills and Sharion Aycock, both of whom decided to take senior status in recent years. 
It’s unclear when the committee will vote on the two nominees, but Republican U.S. Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama said at the hearing that members of the Judicial Committee can submit written questions to the nominees until Sept. 10.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06101033/HB-1020-appeal6.jpg,,,2025-09-03 15:58:20.998100

If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting “988.”
On July 17, the option shut down for LGBTQ+ youth to access specialized mental health support from the national 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said a month earlier that it would no longer “silo” services and would instead “focus on serving all help seekers.” That meant the elimination of the “Press 3” option, the dedicated line answered by staff specifically trained to handle LGBTQ+ youth facing mental health issues ranging from anxiety to thoughts of suicide.
Now, states such as California, Colorado, Illinois and Nevada are scrambling to backfill LGBTQ+ crisis support through training, fees and other initiatives in response to what advocates say is the Trump administration’s hostile stance toward this group. In his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump issued an executive order recognizing only two sexes, male and female, and while campaigning, he condemned gender ideology as “toxic poison.” And the administration omitted “T” for transgender and “Q” for queer or questioning in announcing the elimination of the 988 Press 3 option.
“Since the election, we’ve seen a clear increase in young people feeling devalued, erased, uncertain about their future, and seeing resources taken away,” said Becca Nordeen, senior vice president of crisis intervention at The Trevor Project, a national suicide prevention and crisis intervention nonprofit for LGBTQ+ youth.
Nordeen and other advocates for at-risk kids who helped staff the dedicated line said it has never been more critical for what The Trevor Project estimates are 5.2 million LGBTQ+ people ages 13-24 across the U.S. About 39% of LGBTQ+ young people seriously consider attempting suicide each year, including roughly half of transgender and nonbinary young people, according to a 2023 survey, reflecting a disproportionately high rate of risk.
The use of the dedicated line for LGBTQ+ youth had steadily increased, according to data from the federal substance abuse agency, with nearly 1.6 million calls, texts or online chats since its rollout in October 2022, out of approximately 16.7 million contacts to the general line. The Press 3 option reached record monthly highs in May and June. In 2024, contacts to the line peaked in November, the month of the election.
Call-takers on the general 988 line do not necessarily have the specialized training that the staff on the Press 3 line had, causing fear among LGBTQ+ advocates that they don’t have the right context or language to support youth experiencing crises related to sexuality and gender.
“If a counselor doesn’t know what the concept of coming out is, or being outed, or the increased likelihood of family rejection and how those bring stressors and anxiety, it can inadvertently prevent the trust from being immediately built,” said Mark Henson, The Trevor Project’s interim vice president of advocacy and government affairs, adding that creating that trust at the beginning of calls was a critical “bridge for a youth in crisis to go forward.”

The White House’s Office of Management and Budget did not immediately respond to questions about why the Press 3 option was shut down, but spokesperson Rachel Cauley told NBC News that the department’s budget would not “grant taxpayer money to a chat service where children are encouraged to embrace radical gender ideology by ‘counselors’ without consent or knowledge of their parents.”
Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement: “Continued funding of the Press 3 option threatened to put the entire 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in danger of massive reductions in service.”
When someone calls 988, they are routed to a local crisis center if they are calling from a cellphone carrier that uses “georouting” — a process that routes calls based on approximate areas — unless they select one of the specialized services offered through the national network. While the Press 3 option is officially no longer part of that menu of options, which includes Spanish-language and veterans’ services, states can step in to increase training for their local crisis centers or establish their own options for specialized services.
California is among the states attempting to fill the new service gap, with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office announcing a partnership with The Trevor Project to provide training on LGBTQ+ youth issues for the crisis counselors in the state who answer calls to the general 988 crisis line. The state signed a $700,000 contract with the organization for the training program.
The Trevor Project’s Henson said the details still need to be figured out, including evaluating the training needs of California’s current 988 counselors. The partnership comes as the organization’s own 24/7 crisis line for LGBTQ+ youth faces a crisis of its own: The Trevor Project was one of several providers paid by the federal government to staff the Press 3 option, and the elimination of the service cut the organization’s capacity significantly, according to Henson.
Gordon Coombes, director of Colorado’s 988 hotline, said staff there are increasing outreach to let the public know that the general 988 service hasn’t gone away, even with the loss of the Press 3 option, and that its call-takers welcome calls from the LGBTQ+ population. Staff are promoting services at concerts, community events and Rockies baseball games.
Coombes said the Colorado Behavioral Health Administration contracts with Solari Crisis & Human Services to answer 988 calls, and that the training had already been equipping call-takers on the general line to support LGBTQ+ young people.
The state supports the 988 services via a 7-cent annual fee on cellphone lines. Coombes said the department requested an increase in the fee to bolster its services. While the additional funds would benefit all 988 operations, the request was made in part because of the elimination of the Press 3 option, he said.

Nevada plans to ensure that all 988 crisis counselors get training on working with LGBTQ+ callers, according to state health department spokesperson Daniel Vezmar. Vezmar said Nevada’s $50 million investment in a new call center last November would help increase call capacity, and that the state’s Division of Public and Behavioral Health would monitor the impact of the closure of the Press 3 option and make changes as needed.
The Illinois Department of Human Services announced after the Press 3 option’s termination that it was working to train existing call center counselors on supporting LGBTQ+ youth and promoting related affirming messages and imagery in its outreach about the 988 line. A July increase in a state telecommunications tax will help fund expanded efforts, and the agency is exploring additional financial options to fill in the new gap.
Kelly Crosbie, director of North Carolina’s Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Use Services, said the division has recently invested in partnerships with community organizations to increase mental health support for marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ populations, through the state’s 988 call center and other programs.
“We’ve wanted to make sure we were beefing up the services,” Crosbie said, noting that North Carolina’s Republican legislature continues to restrict health care for transgender youth.
Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said Congress could put the funding for the LGBTQ+ line in any final appropriations bill it passes. She also said states could individually codify permanent funding for an LGBTQ+ option, the way Washington state has created and funded a “Press 4” option for its Native American population to reach crisis counselors who are tribal members or descendants trained in cultural practices. The state created the option by carving out some of its 988 funding. No state has publicly announced a plan to make such an investment for LGBTQ+ populations.
Federal lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have spoken out against the closure of the LGBTQ+ 988 option and urged that it be reinstated. At a July press conference alongside Democratic colleagues, Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican who represents part of New York’s Hudson Valley, said he and Republican Rep. Young Kim of Orange County, California, wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., urging him to reverse course and keep the LGBTQ+ line.
“What we must agree on is that when a child is in crisis — when they are alone, when they are afraid, when they are unsure of where to turn to, when they are contemplating suicide — they need access to help right away,” Lawler said. “Regardless of where you stand on these issues, as Americans, as people, we must all agree there is purpose and worth to each and every life.”

A circuit court judge’s ruling Wednesday prevents the state Election Commission from providing the requested voter registration data ahead of a hearing next week.
The order follows a lawsuit, filed last Friday in Calhoun County, that seeks to prevent South Carolina from providing voters’ information to the U.S. Department of Justice.
The federal agency’s letter, dated Aug. 6, was part of a nationwide push by the Trump administration to get voter rolls from all states. It set a deadline of this Friday and seeks information that includes full names, addresses, drivers’ license numbers and final digits of Social Security numbers. How, exactly, that information will be used is unclear.

PIImageDisplay (2)-7-8 
Some states declined straight away, citing voters’ privacy.
South Carolina’s Election Commission staff started working last week to fulfill the administration’s request for the information, agency spokesman John Michael Catalano said in an email.
The lawsuit filed on behalf of Calhoun County voter Anne Crook argues divulging her personal information is an invasion of her privacy.
The state constitution guarantees residents a right to privacy, and state law prohibits divulging certain personal information, wrote her attorney, Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto, in the court filing.
State law also requires the Election Commission keep all personal information confidential, wrote the Orangeburg Democrat.
Hutto’s concern over the federal government getting people’s private information grew after a whistleblower claimed last month the Department of Government Efficiency put millions of people’s Social Security numbers at risk of hacking, Hutto told the SC Daily Gazette.
A similar lapse with other personal information, such as driver’s license numbers, could open people up to identity theft and other crimes, he said.
Crook, a former president of Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College, had concerns over how that data might be used that other residents shared, Hutto said.
“I think most people have some questions about why the federal government wants their data,” Hutto said.
Judge Diane Goodstein’s order may bring some answers.
Releasing a voter’s personal information could cause “immediate and irreparable damage” in violating her right to privacy, wrote the 1st Circuit Court judge in putting any transfer of information on hold.
State law shouldn’t keep states from releasing voter information, reads the U.S. Department of Justice letter, along with a follow-up letter sent just over a week later. The letter cites federal voter registration laws that the attorney general is tasked with enforcing, claiming those laws give the department the right to access voter data.
Goodstein set a hearing for Sept. 10 in Aiken to hear arguments over whether she should keep the block in place.
Until then, the Election Commission “will continue to coordinate with the DOJ to explore lawful options for data sharing while adhering to the court’s order,” Catalano said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/I-Voted-Sticker-scaled-e1726250561576-1024x834.jpg,,,2025-09-03 15:58:20.998100

Schoolchildren, college students, and even nursing home residents would no longer have to be vaccinated against infectious diseases and viruses if Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and his boss, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, have their way.
The DeSantis administration rolled out the proposed change on Wednesday and, if it is successful, the state would be the first in the nation to completely eliminate vaccine requirements that many health experts credit with nearly eliminating some diseases.
“Your body is a gift from God. What you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and your God,” said Ladapo, attacking the government mandates.
“It’s wrong, it’s immoral. They do not have the right to tell you what you put in your body. They don’t have the right to tell you what your kids have to put in [their] body. They do not have the right. Do not give it to them. Take it away from them. And we’re going to be starting that here in Florida.”
’Choose a side’
Neither Ladapo nor DeSantis discussed with legislative leadership their intent in the 2026 legislative session to push to eliminate vaccine mandates from the books before Wednesday’s announcement.
The surgeon general praised the Legislature and went so far as saying he “loves our lawmakers.” But Ladapo issued an ultimatum.
“They’re going to have to make decisions, right? That’s the way that this becomes possible. So, people are going to have to make a decision. People are going to have to, have to choose a side. And I am telling you right now that you know the moral side is, it’s so simple.”
Patients would remain free to take shots if they like.
CDC vaccine officials resign while childhood vaccination rates decline

Democratic officials quickly blasted the announcement, deeming it a “reckless” decision that could lead to a drop in those immunized in the state. Florida has already seen its immunization rate for school-aged children tick down in recent years, although more than three-quarters of school children have received shots.
“This is ridiculous. Florida already has broad medical and religious exemptions for childhood vaccines, so any family that has a sincere opposition to vaccination can opt-out. Removing the mandate wholesale is dangerous, anti-science, and anti-child. Nobody wants to go back to the days of iron lungs,” Senate Democratic leader Sen. Lori Berman, from Boynton Beach, said in a statement.
“Republicans have gone from entertaining anti-science conspiracy theories to fully endorsing an anti-science health policy. As a member of the Senate Health Policy Committee, I’ll be doing everything in my power to protect our kids from these reckless attempts to harm them.”
Sen. Shevrin Jones, a Democrat from Miami Gardens, also criticized the announcement.
“Ending vaccine mandates poses a grave public health risk and will likely lead to a resurgence of preventable diseases. This reckless move jeopardizes the health and lives of countless Floridians — from children to seniors — especially those too young to be vaccinated or those with compromised immune systems. The DeSantis administration is actively undermining public health, making communities more vulnerable to outbreaks and increasing the burden on healthcare systems.”
Florida law contains a number of immunization requirements for the young and the old.
Immunization for poliomyelitis, diphtheria, rubeola, rubella, pertussis, mumps, and tetanus are required for entry and attendance in Florida schools, childcare facilities, and family daycare homes. The state allows exemptions for valid medical reasons but also for religious and certain belief systems and, in some cases, allows personal exemptions for philosophical beliefs.
Florida law also requires school districts to develop and disseminate parent guides that include information about the importance of student health and available immunizations and vaccinations, including, but not limited to, recommended immunization schedules in accordance with federal recommendations.
The school guide must include detailed information regarding the causes, symptoms, and transmission of meningococcal disease and the availability, effectiveness, known contraindications, and appropriate age for the administration of any required or recommended vaccine against that infection.
College students who reside in on-campus housing must provide documentation of vaccinations against meningococcal meningitis and hepatitis B. Again, the law contains exemptions and students who refuse the vaccines are required to sign waivers.
Nursing homes are required to assess residents within five business days post admission of eligibility for pneumococcal vaccinations or revaccinations. If indicated, the resident must be be vaccinated or revaccinated within 60 days after admission, in accordance with the recommendations of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, subject to exemptions for medical contraindications and religious or personal beliefs.
Immunization may not be provided to a resident who provides documentation that he or she has been immunized. A resident may elect to receive the immunization from his or her personal physician and, if so, the resident needs to provide proof of the immunization to the facility. The agency may adopt and enforce any rules necessary to comply.
2025 efforts fall short
The 2026 legislative session begins in January, which is when the DeSantis administration will  work with the Legislature in hopes of accomplishing its goal. But the Department of Health will also revise rules for a handful of vaccines that are mandated in rule but not in statue.
A substantially scaled-back effort to address vaccine mandates fell short during the 2025 session.
The DOH this spring championed a broad bill (HB 1299) continuing a law initially passed in 2021 that banned businesses, government entities, and education institutions from denying people entry or service based on vaccination status or requiring people to wear masks. HB 1299 extended the ban permanently.
The bill expanded the Patient’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities statutes to prohibit providers and facilities from denying admission, care, or services to a patient based solely on vaccination status.
Although the House agreed to the language, passing HB 1299 by a near-unanimous vote, state Sen. Gayle Harrell, whose late husband was a physician, warned that the requirement would open doctors to increased liability. Independent Sen. Jason Pizzo said the mandate to treat patients would have contradicted a law DeSantis championed that guarantees Florida physicians legal protections to not treat patients on the basis of their conscience.
The Senate deleted the language before passing the proposal and the House ultimately agreed to the Senate’s version.
Ladapo the lightning rod
Ladapo is a well known vaccine skeptic. He emphasized parents’ rights to send their kids to school unvaccinated in spring after a measles case in a Miami-Dade County high school. He altered a DOH Covid vaccine study to exaggerate the risks of cardiac death for young men
His positions on vaccinations aren’t the only reason he’s become a public health lightning rod.
The DOH last month announced 21 cases of Campylobacter and E. coli infections tied to raw milk consumption in the central and northeast portions of the state, and said that seven people had been hospitalized. Six of the cases were reported in children under age 10. Nevertheless, Ladapo didn’t warn against consuming raw milk.
Two days later, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson issued a statement encouraging residents to stick to pasteurized milk.
And in 2021, Ladapo made national headlines when he refused to don a mask during a meeting with state Sen. Tina Polsky, who was being treated for cancer and requested that he wear one. At the time, Ladapo was up for Senate confirmation.
Polksky, a Democrat from Boca Raton, also lambasted Ladapo’s announcement Wednesday.
“Vaccines are crucial for our children because they protect them from deadly diseases and keep entire communities safe through herd immunity. Diseases, including polio, that once destroyed our children’s health and futures, will have the chance to return under this dangerous policy change. I voted against Dr. Ladapo’s confirmation in 2023 because he has a habit of misrepresenting science and making decisions that affect the health of Floridians. He remains determined to prioritize political dogma over smart health decisions.”
Florida Make America Healthy Again Commission
Ladapo’s announcement dovetails with DeSantis’ news that he has created a Florida Make America Healthy Again Commission that will recommend the integration of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Make America Healthy Again effort. The Florida Commission will be co-chaired by  first lady Casey DeSantis and Lt. Gov. Jay Collins.

Jose Manuel Herrera, 71, the principal owner of Bayvista, was charged on Wednesday in Ramsey County with two felony counts of wage theft and six felony counts of tax evasion and insurance fraud. His wife and son, Carrie Jane Gutbrod-Herrera, 66, and Joseph Earl Herrera, 41, were also charged with felony tax evasion as part owners in the contracting business.
The case is one of the first in Minnesota to use the state’s 2019 wage theft law that made it a felony to steal more than $1,000 in wages, like other forms of theft.
While labor experts and law enforcement say wage theft is pervasive, it is seldom prosecuted. That’s starting to change in Minnesota as trade unions, state agencies and law enforcement invest more resources in investigating and prosecuting labor violations.
“This will not be the last case. We have many many more that are in the pipeline,” Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said Wednesday at a news conference.
He credited the coordinated effort with the St. Paul Police Department, the state Department of Revenue and the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.
According to the criminal complaint, Jose Herrera’s company was hired in 2024 by Magnuson Construction to supply workers to replace the roofing and gutters at McDonough Homes, 580-townhome style affordable apartments run by the St. Paul Public Housing Agency.
The contract was worth over $500,000 and because the renovations were publicly funded, the Herreras were required to pay minimum prevailing wages set by the state.
Roofers were entitled to $68.54 per hour in wages and benefits and the gutter replacement workers were entitled to $83.74 per hour. But workers were only paid between $120 to $200 per day, in cash, according to the criminal complaint.
Jose Herrera knew what workers were supposed to earn because he instructed them to tell anyone who asked that they were being paid the prevailing wage and to not mention the daily rate, according to the complaint.
The Reformer called phone numbers listed for the Herreras but could not reach them.
While the complaint alleges wage theft from just seven workers, Choi said the investigation is ongoing and he believes at least two dozen workers were shorted upwards of $250,000 in wages.
In addition to stealing from workers, the complaint alleges the Herreras shorted the government by underreporting their incomes and the number of their employees in order to pay lower income taxes, unemployment contributions and workers’ compensation insurance premiums.
Jose Herrera avoided paying more than $135,000 in workers’ compensation insurance premiums and $1,000 in unemployment insurance contributions, according to the complaint.
He and his wife also failed to pay an estimated $158,509 in 2024 in Minnesota income taxes from dozens of construction contracts with Bayvista’s estimated gross revenue of $4.8 million that year. Joseph Herrera failed to pay an estimated $55,764 in state income taxes, according to the criminal complaint.
Furthermore, by paying workers in cash and not withholding income taxes for workers, Bayvista shorted state coffers more than $26,000.
St. Paul police opened an investigation after receiving reports from representatives from the North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters, who had talked to workers on the project, about possible wage theft and unsafe practices with workers not using safety harnesses.
Trade unions have played an instrumental role in nearly every major wage theft case in the state by monitoring job sites and helping workers file complaints with law enforcement and state regulators.
The International Union of Painters and Allied Trades union helped workers come forward in Minneapolis leading to the very first conviction of felony wage theft in Minnesota this summer. And the Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers assisted Choi’s office in bringing a case against Stillwater Masonry Restoration with the owner pleading guilty to felony tax evasion.
“Some people think that (trade unions) are just looking out for their membership. They are not. They are looking out for what’s fair and what’s right out in our community,” St. Paul Police Chief Axel Henry said.
Mike Wilde, executive director of the Fair Contracting Foundation of Minnesota, said the case against the Herreras illustrates “garden variety” wage theft with a contractor using cash payments to conceal underpayments and reduce their tax and insurance liabilities.
While the practice may be common, it is also hard to prosecute because it requires workers to participate as witnesses.
That may become even harder under the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement since many victims of wage theft in construction are in the country without authorization. Under the Biden administration, noncitizen workers who were victims of labor violations could be protected from deportation.
“When you scare all the witnesses away because of deportation threats, then you have less cooperation,” Wilde said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P1230729-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-03 15:58:20.998100

A coalition of liberal groups in Colorado want to ask voters in 2026 whether higher earners in the state should pay more in income taxes to raise billions more in revenue.
The group, dubbed Protect Colorado’s Future, submitted ballot measure language Wednesday for a constitutional amendment that would raise the income tax rate for Coloradans making at least $500,000.
“A graduated income tax is just common sense: 98% of us get a tax cut, and the folks doing really well chip in a fair share to keep our schools strong, our healthcare system solid, and our communities thriving. That’s how we build a Colorado where everyone gets ahead, not just the lucky few,” Kathy White, executive director of the Colorado Fiscal Institute, said in a statement.

Colorado’s income tax is currently at 4.4%. The measure would bump that rate to 4.6% for people making at least $600,000 and increase it as people earn more, to a 9.2% rate for people making at least $10 million per year. People earning less than $250,000 per year would see a slight income tax reduction.
The proposal is what’s known as a graduated income tax rate, in which people pay a higher percentage as their income increases. Twenty-seven states and Washington D.C. use a similar system. Colorado is one of 14 states with a flat income tax.
Colorado is also subject to the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, which caps annual state spending according to inflation and population growth. Colorado can retain and spend tax revenue only up to that limit, even if it collects more and even if costs for government services balloon.










The cruel cuts to healthcare and the absurd corporate tax giveaways in the federal budget bill have pushed Colorado over the edge, and only the voters of Colorado have the power to make the wealthy pay their fair share and restore funding to critical state priorities.


– Chris deGruy Kennedy, head of Bell Policy Center


“For more than three decades, an upside-down tax code has hurt Colorado’s schools, health care, childcare and the environment,” said Chris deGruy Kennedy, head of the left-leaning Bell Policy Center. “The cruel cuts to healthcare and the absurd corporate tax giveaways in the federal budget bill have pushed Colorado over the edge, and only the voters of Colorado have the power to make the wealthy pay their fair share and restore funding to critical state priorities.”
The recent federal spending cut and tax break bill slashed Colorado’s expected tax revenue for the current fiscal year by about $1.2 billion and will increase the state’s financial obligation for Medicaid and nutrition assistance programs in future years.
The groups behind the proposal include the Bell Policy Center, the Colorado Fiscal Institute, the Colorado Children’s Campaign, the Colorado Center on Law and Policy, New Era Colorado, Great Education Colorado, the Colorado Statewide Parents Coalition, the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, the Blueprint to End Hunger, Colorado Counties and Commissioners Acting Together, the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, and the Colorado Organization for Latina Opportunity and Reproductive Rights.
To place the constitutional amendment on the ballot, the coalition would need to get at least 125,000 petition signatures, including from at least 2% of the voters in each of the state’s 35 state Senate districts.
Conservative activists are pursuing other ballot measures that would cut the income tax rate across the board. Voters approved rate cuts in 2020 and 2022.

Chuck Grassley said he plans to follow up with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the Thursday Senate Finance Committee hearing about his commitments to issues like regulating pharmacy benefit managers, improving rural health care systems and oversight of agriculture and dietary guidelines.
When Kennedy faced questions from senators on the committee during the confirmation process in January, Grassley presented him a list of statements on what he expects from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. These included calling for Kennedy to “leave agricultural practice regulations to the proper agencies,” provide timely and complete information when responding to congressional oversight requests and work to lower drug prices through measures targeting business practices of PBMs, the entities that negotiate prescription drug prices between drug manufacturers, pharmacies and health insurance companies.
Grassley presented his expectations to Kennedy and asked him if he agreed or disagreed with the statements — all of which Kennedy said he agreed with in January.

During a call with reporters Tuesday, Grassley said he plans to follow up on these expectations at the hearing.
“Now he’s been in office for five or six months, I’m thinking that maybe I ought to go back and say, ‘this is what you told me in January or February, whenever it was — do you still think you told me the right thing?’ And, ‘are you doing what you told me you would do?'” Grassley said.
The Iowa Republican also said there are many other issues he hopes to hear about from Kennedy at the hearing tomorrow, saying “he still has some attitudes about agriculture that I’m interested in getting further readout.”
Kennedy’s appearance before the Senate Finance Committee Thursday follows major leadership changes in the federal government’s public health centers. President Donald Trump fired Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez in late August, and several other high-level CDC officials resigned shortly after. As HHS secretary, Kennedy is involved in overseeing the CDC.
Both Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress have called for answers and investigations into the HHS and related public health entities following the shake-up, and have also brought up concerns about the administration’s current approach to subjects like vaccinations. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, who chairs the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said last week “high profile departures will require oversight by the HELP Committee.” He also called for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to indefinitely postpone its September meeting as “serious allegations have been made about the meeting agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed for the now announced September ACIP meeting.”
According to the Des Moines Register, Grassley told reporters Aug. 29 he believes decisions made by public health officials and scientists on vaccines “should not be a political determination.”
“He’s got some changes he wants to make in vaccines,” Grassley said at an Indianola event. “I don’t think it’s quite fair to say he’s anti-vaccine, but he’s got some changes he wants to make. I think we need more direction where he’s headed for.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Almost 12% of Utahns are enrolled into the Affordable Care Act health insurance marketplace, a platform established in 2010. That’s the fourth highest number in the country.
The percentage represents about 421,900 Utah enrollees. According to a Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute study, that’s higher than the state’s Medicaid enrollment rate, which accounted for 9.7% of Utahns as of February 2025. 
HealthCare.gov is a platform run by federal or state governments that helps families, small business owners, their employees, and self-employed workers without access to Medicaid or Medicare compare and select health insurance plans.

“The Marketplace and the accompanying tax credits help make health insurance coverage affordable for Utahns who do not have access to health insurance coverage through work or public health care coverage programs,” Melanie Beagley, senior health research analyst at the Gardner Institute said in a news release. “These include small business owners, their employees, and self-employed workers.”
About 710,000 Utahns work at small businesses, which aren’t mandated to provide health insurance coverage to employees. Only 40.8% of them have access to insurance through their employers, analysts wrote. That’s the sixth lowest in the nation. 
The federal government funds up to approximately $1.7 billion in premium tax credits for the state, the study estimated. With a monthly average tax credit of $463, the monthly average marketplace plan premium for Utah residents is $70.



Let us know what you think...


 


However, premium subsidies that were increased in 2021 under the American Rescue Plan Act for every income level, including those making below 200% the poverty level, and were extended in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, are set to disappear at the end of this year without another extension.
That would have a deep impact on most enrollees, as almost 63% of Affordable Care Act Marketplace enrollees have incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level, which this year is roughly $31,300 per year for individuals and about $64,200 for a family of four. 
The largest chunk in Utah are children under 18 years old, representing about 28% of the whole population that uses the platform.

Ron DeSantis, want to eliminate all vaccine mandates from Florida law as well as rules and regulations. (Stock photo by Getty Images)School children, college students, and even nursing home residents would no longer have to be vaccinated against infectious diseases and viruses if Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo and his boss, Gov. Ron DeSantis, have their way.
The DeSantis administration rolled out the proposed change on Wednesday and, if they’re successful, the state would be the first in the nation to completely eliminate vaccine requirements that many health experts credit with nearly eliminating some diseases.
“Your body is a gift from God. What you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and your God,” said Ladapo, attacking the government mandates.
“It’s wrong, it’s immoral. They do not have the right to tell you what you put in your body. They don’t have the right to tell you what your kids have to put in [their] body. They do not have the right. Do not give it to them. Take it away from them. And we’re going to be starting that here in Florida.”
’Choose a side’
Neither Ladapo nor DeSantis discussed with legislative leadership their intent in the 2026 legislative session to push to eliminate vaccine mandates from the books before making the announcement.
The surgeon general praised the Legislature and went so far as saying he “loves our lawmakers.” But Ladapo issued an ultimatum.
“They’re going to have to make decisions, right? That’s the way that this becomes possible. So, people are going to have to make a decision. People are going to have to, have to choose a side. And I am telling you right now that you know the moral side is, it’s so simple.”
Patients would remain free to take shots if they like.
Democratic officials quickly blasted the announcement, deeming it a “reckless” decision that could lead to a drop in those immunized in the state. Florida has already seen its immunization rate for school-aged children tick down in recent years, although more than three-quarters of school children have received shots.
“This is ridiculous. Florida already has broad medical and religious exemptions for childhood vaccines, so any family that has a sincere opposition to vaccination can opt-out. Removing the mandate wholesale is dangerous, anti-science, and anti-child. Nobody wants to go back to the days of iron lungs,” Senate Democratic leader Sen. Lori Berman, from Boynton Beach, said in a statement.
“Republicans have gone from entertaining anti-science conspiracy theories to fully endorsing an anti-science health policy. As a member of the Senate Health Policy Committee, I’ll be doing everything in my power to protect our kids from these reckless attempts to harm them.”
Sen. Shevrin Jones, a Democrat from Miami Gardens, also criticized the announcement.
“Ending vaccine mandates poses a grave public health risk and will likely lead to a resurgence of preventable diseases. This reckless move jeopardizes the health and lives of countless Floridians — from children to seniors — especially those too young to be vaccinated or those with compromised immune systems. The DeSantis administration is actively undermining public health, making communities more vulnerable to outbreaks and increasing the burden on healthcare systems.”

Current requirements

Florida law contains a number of immunization requirements for the young and the old.
Immunization for poliomyelitis, diphtheria, rubeola, rubella, pertussis, mumps, and tetanus are required for entry and attendance in Florida schools, childcare facilities, and family daycare homes. The state allows exemptions for valid medical reasons but also for religious and certain belief systems and, in some cases, allows personal exemptions for philosophical beliefs.
Florida law also requires school districts to develop and disseminate parent guides that include information about the importance of student health and available immunizations and vaccinations, including, but not limited to, recommended immunization schedules in accordance with federal recommendations. 
The school guide must include detailed information regarding the causes, symptoms, and transmission of meningococcal disease and the availability, effectiveness, known contraindications, and appropriate age for the administration of any required or recommended vaccine against that infection.
The Florida Education Association issued a statement warning that changing the rules would endanger students and faculty.
“When leaders talk about pulling back vaccines, they’re talking about disrupting student learning and making schools less safe. State leaders say they care about reducing chronic absenteeism and keeping kids in school — but reducing vaccinations does the opposite, putting our children’s health and education at risk,” the union said.
“We’re reviewing the potential impacts on public schools and our communities. But, make no mistake, FEA will continue to stand up for our students, our educators, and our public schools.”
College students who reside in on-campus housing must provide documentation of vaccinations against meningococcal meningitis and hepatitis B. Again, the law contains exemptions and students who refuse the vaccines are required to sign waivers.
Nursing homes are required to assess residents within five business days post admission of eligibility for pneumococcal vaccinations or revaccinations. If indicated, the resident must be be vaccinated or revaccinated within 60 days after admission, in accordance with the recommendations of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, subject to exemptions for medical contraindications and religious or personal beliefs.
Immunization may not be provided to a resident who provides documentation that he or she has been immunized. A resident may elect to receive the immunization from his or her personal physician and, if so, the resident needs to provide proof of the immunization to the facility. The agency may adopt and enforce any rules necessary to comply.
2025 efforts fall short
Sen. Gayle Harrell (Photo via the Florida Senate.)
The 2026 legislative session begins in January, which is when the DeSantis administration will work with the Legislature in hopes of accomplishing its goal. But the Department of Health will also revise rules for a handful of vaccines that are mandated in rule but not in statue.
A substantially scaled-back effort to address vaccine mandates fell short during the 2025 session.
The DOH this spring championed a broad bill (HB 1299) continuing a law initially passed in 2021 that banned businesses, government entities, and education institutions from denying people entry or service based on vaccination status or requiring people to wear masks. HB 1299 extended the ban permanently.
The bill expanded the Patient’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities statutes to prohibit providers and facilities from denying admission, care, or services to a patient based solely on vaccination status. 
Although the House agreed to the language, passing HB 1299 by a near-unanimous vote, state Sen. Gayle Harrell, a Republican from Stuart whose late husband was a physician, warned that the requirement would open doctors to increased liability. Sen. Jason Pizzo, a Hollywood lawmaker with no party affiliation, said the mandate to treat patients would have contradicted a law DeSantis championed that guarantees Florida physicians legal protections to not treat patients on the basis of their conscience.
The Senate deleted the language before passing the proposal and the House ultimately agreed to the Senate’s version.
Ladapo the lightning rod
Ladapo is a well known vaccine skeptic. He emphasized parents’ rights to send their kids to school unvaccinated in spring after a measles case in a Miami-Dade County high school. He altered a DOH COVID-19 vaccine study to exaggerate the risks of cardiac death for young men
His positions on vaccinations aren’t the only reason he’s become a public health lightning rod.
The DOH last month announced 21 cases of Campylobacter and E. coli infections tied to raw milk consumption in the central and northeast portions of the state, and said that seven people had been hospitalized. Six of the cases were reported in children under age 10. Nevertheless, Ladapo didn’t warn against consuming raw milk.
Two days later, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson issued a statement encouraging residents to stick to pasteurized milk.
And in 2021, Ladapo made national headlines when he refused to don a mask during a meeting with state Sen. Tina Polsky, who was being treated for cancer and requested that he wear one. At the time, Ladapo was up for Senate confirmation.
Polksky, a Democrat from Boca Raton, lambasted Ladapo’s announcement Wednesday.
“Vaccines are crucial for our children because they protect them from deadly diseases and keep entire communities safe through herd immunity,” she said in a written statement.
Diseases, including polio, that once destroyed our children’s health and futures, will have the chance to return under this dangerous policy change. I voted against Dr. Ladapo’s confirmation in 2023 because he has a habit of misrepresenting science and making decisions that affect the health of Floridians. He remains determined to prioritize political dogma over smart health decisions.”
Florida Make America Healthy Again Commission
Ladapo’s announcement dovetails with DeSantis’ news that he has created a Florida Make America Healthy Again Commission that will recommend the integration of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Make America Healthy Again effort. The Florida Commission will be co-chaired by  first lady Casey DeSantis and Lt. Gov. Jay Collins.
Meanwhile, at the end of August, the Food and Drug Administration approved updated vaccines for COVID-19. While previous versions of the vaccine were recommended to individuals 6 months of age and older, access to the FDA’s newly approved vaccines is limited to individuals 65 and older and individuals between the age of 5 and 64 with an underlying condition placing them at high risk for severe COVID-19.

The risk of a “massive loss” in funding for roads and bridges.
Those are just some of the impacts that officials at the local level in Colorado are left to deal with in the wake of congressional Republicans’ passage of a domestic policy megabill earlier this year, advocates said at a press conference outside Denver’s City and County Building on Wednesday.
The GOP’s tax break and spending bill cut an estimated $1.4 trillion from Medicaid, health insurance subsidies, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and other areas of federal social spending. At the same time, it enacted more than $5 trillion in tax cuts that largely benefit the wealthiest Americans, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Colorado lawmakers convened at the state Capitol last month for a six-day special legislative session to address the bill’s impacts to the state budget, which were triggered because the state’s income tax code automatically mirrors changes at the federal level. They passed legislation that repealed certain tax credits and loopholes for Colorado businesses, tapped into the state’s reserve funds and gave Gov. Jared Polis special authority to make about $250 million in midyear spending cuts, primarily to health care, higher education and state grant programs.
Wynn Howell, Colorado state director of the Working Families Party​, blamed the megabill for the shortfall it created in the state budget, which Polis’ office estimated to be $783 million​. “But there’s not been enough conversation about how this is impacting local communities, because it certainly is doing that too​,” Howell said.
Denver’s two at-large City Council members, Serena Gonzales-Gutierrez and Sarah Parady, spoke about the fallout for Denver’s economic well-being and the city budget, which already faced a $250 million shortfall this year driven by rising costs and sluggish growth in sales tax revenues.
“If you were to ask either one of us or anyone who we work with in this building, what keeps us up at night, we would begin racking off a list for you of expenses and costs, and (the question of) how we’re going to keep this city safe, secure, fed, sheltered, housed, given the impacts of this federal bill,” Parady said. “It is probably the number one thing weighing on me as a member of this council.”










If you are a member of Congress and you supported this bill, then I'm going to tell you — you have no clue what regular Americans, regular Coloradans, regular Denverites are facing. You have no clue.


– Sarah Parady, Denver City Council at-large member


State lawmakers wrote in a letter earlier this year that Colorado’s hospitals, clinics and other providers could lose up to $990 million in annual federal Medicaid funding. Those impacts could be particularly acute in Denver, where most major medical providers serve patients who are enrolled in Medicaid, Parady said, as the GOP bill’s work requirements and other restrictions on Medicaid eligibility go into effect.
“Anyone who’s doing a lot of their services to people who are living in poverty, they are going to now have this huge bureaucratic burden of basically trying to help people stay enrolled, re-enroll, or meet particular requirements and jump through particular hoops,” she said. “Otherwise they lose what is effectively a huge portion of their budget in Medicaid reimbursements.”
The Republican measure also included an estimated $186 billion in cuts to SNAP funding, largely through new eligibility restrictions and by shifting costs onto states. Colorado lawmakers will ask voters this November to partially offset the lost SNAP funding with excess revenue from a universal school meals program, but food assistance providers across Colorado are bracing for the potential impacts of increased demand.
“People will wonder, why are they relying more on food banks and food access programs, leaving millions upon millions of children and families to go hungry?” Gonzales-Gutierrez said. “Because of the cuts to SNAP.”
“If you are a member of Congress and you supported this bill, then I’m going to tell you — you have no clue what regular Americans, regular Coloradans, regular Denverites are facing. You have no clue,” Parady said. “This bill is delusional. It is a wave of harm that is coming for our cities, and we are trying to hold the bag with a tax base that cannot possibly meet what we are losing.”

(City of Las Vegas photo)The Las Vegas City Council voted unanimously Wednesday to appoint a replacement for Victoria Seaman, who resigned from the position last week to become a regional director in Denver for President Donald Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services. 
The council rejected the prospect of holding a special election, which is projected to cost $467,000, according to city officials. 
The council is seeking applicants interested in temporarily representing Ward 2. The application, which is posted on the city website, includes a pledge from the applicant that they will not run for election to the council next year. 
“There’s nothing that we can do to enforce that. Is that correct?” Councilwoman Shondra Summers-Armstrong inquired of the city attorney, who agreed the appointed councilmember could not legally be prohibited from running. 
“While it’s not legally binding, it’s very important, from my perspective, that this council not engage in any electioneering or trying to give one candidate an advantage over another,” Councilwoman Francis Allen Palenske responded. 
Appointed council members are historically at an advantage in subsequent elections. 
In 2004, newly appointed Las Vegas City Councilman Steve Wolfson faced 11 challengers in the city’s general election, but prevailed and went on to win another two elections to the seat.  
The city intends to advertise the council opening on its website today through 5 p.m. Friday. 
Applicants must live in Ward 2, which encompasses much of Summerlin. 
The mayor and council will individually review the applications and resumes and submit their top three in ranking order to Human Resources by Sept. 7, according to Human Resources Director Vince Zamora. Based on the council rankings, HR will forward the top three finalists for discussion at the Sept. 17 City Council meeting.

Bill Lee’s office announced Wednesday.
Deputy Commissioner Andy Holt, a former Tennessee House representative, will take the reins on Oct. 1.
Hatcher, a veterinarian and fifth-generation Tennessee farmer, was among Lee’s first cabinet picks after Lee won the 2018 gubernatorial election. Hatcher was sworn in as the state’s 38th commissioner of agriculture in January 2019.
Hatcher said his time as commissioner was “the honor of my life” in a prepared statement.

“Together, we have made the largest investments in rural Tennessee’s history, expanded opportunities for young people through FFA, 4H, and education partnerships, and safeguarded farmland for future generations,” he said.
Hatcher also praised Lee’s push to preserve Tennessee farmland, most recently through the Tennessee Farmland Preservation Act. 
Tennessee’s General Assembly approved the governor-backed legislation in May, setting aside $25 million in grants for farmers who choose to place their farmland in a permanent conservation easement. The easement blocks farmland from being sold for any purpose other than agricultural use. It took two years for Lee to rally support for the act, which went into effect in July.
“I am proud to have played a role in carrying forward his vision,” Hatcher said of Lee’s farmland conservation initiative.
Prior to his appointment as commissioner, Hatcher served as the agriculture department’s state veterinarian starting in 2009.
Outside of his nearly 21 years of government service, Hatcher founded Rock-N-Country Veterinary Services in College Grove in the early 1990s. The practice is now run by his daughter Jennifer. 
The Hatcher family farm and dairy, which is now run by his son Charles, have called College Grove home since 1831.

Lee said he is “confident (Holt) will serve Tennesseans with integrity by strengthening rural communities and supporting our agriculture industry” in a Wednesday statement. 
As deputy commissioner, Holt oversaw the Tennessee Department of Agriculture’s daily operations, including programs spanning food safety, animal and plant health, forestry, and agricultural development, according to a news release from Lee’s office.
Holt, a first-generation farmer, lives with his wife Ellie and their seven children on Holt Family Farms in Dresden.
Holt’s farming operation fell under scrutiny in 2015 when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency threatened to seek $177,500 in fines from him, alleging that he improperly buried hog carcasses and dumped around 800,000 gallons of waste water into a tributary of the Mississippi River without a permit. 
Holt said at the time that he self-reported the discharges. The EPA ultimately withdrew its filing in 2016 when he agreed to enter into a consent order requiring him to close and clean up two wastewater lagoons on the property.

Fondos del estado lo mantiene abierto, pero ¿por cuánto tiempo?",Deborah Brennan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/calmatters-en-espanol/2025/09/blythe-hospital-rural-estuvo-a-punto-de-cerrar/,El cierre de hospitales rurales es un problema inminente en toda California. Dos legisladores del Inland Empire instan a las autoridades estatales a tomar medidas para salvar un hospital en Blythe.,"This article is also available in English. Read it here.
La primavera pasada, el Hospital Palo Verde en Blythe estuvo al borde del cierre, después de que una serie de contratiempos financieros lo dejaran sin fondos.
 En mayo, el hospital anunció que no aceptaría nuevos pacientes “en el futuro previsible”, aunque su sala de emergencias y su clínica permanecieron abiertas, informó el Riverside Record.
 LEER MÁS : Regreso al futuro: ¿Esta prisión de California volverá a convertirse en un hotel de lujo?
 Pero la financiación estatal de emergencia anunciada este verano ayudará a que el hospital rural permanezca abierto, según el senador estatal Steve Padilla, demócrata de San Diego, cuyo distrito incluye partes del Inland Empire.
“En un momento en que nuestros hospitales rurales enfrentan dificultades financieras y un posible cierre, es crucial que el estado intervenga para garantizar que todos los californianos tengan acceso a atención médica vital”, declaró Padilla . “Estos hospitales suelen ser la única fuente de atención médica para toda una comunidad. El Hospital Palo Verde es el único centro de cuidados intensivos en una area de 160 kilómetros, aproximadamente a dos horas en coche; demasiado lejos en caso de emergencia”.
Como el Hospital Palo Verde había suspendido la admisión de nuevos pacientes en mayo, el representante Raúl Ruiz, demócrata de Palm Desert, pidió al gobernador Gavin Newsom que asignara $4 millones del presupuesto estatal para mantenerlo a flote, informó el Desert Sun.
 Calificó el cierre inminente como una emergencia de salud pública que “pone vidas en riesgo y dejaría una brecha masiva en la atención médica en una de las regiones más desatendidas de nuestro estado”.
 Las agencias estatales intervinieron, pero no proporcionaron la cantidad solicitada por Ruiz. El Departamento de Servicios de Atención Médica del estado agilizó los pagos de Medi-Cal por $560,000 al Hospital Palo Verde “para apoyar las operaciones del hospital y proteger el acceso a la atención médica para la comunidad”, informó la Agencia de Salud y Servicios Humanos de California a CalMatters en un correo electrónico.
 El año pasado, el Departamento de Acceso e Información sobre Atención Médica otorgó al centro 8,5 millones de dólares a través del Programa de Préstamos para Hospitales en Dificultades, pero ya no hay fondos disponibles a través de dicho programa. Como beneficiario de dicha ayuda, el hospital tuvo que presentar un plan de reestructuración que detallaba cómo utilizaría estos fondos para mantenerse solvente a largo plazo.
 El hospital también obtendrá una extensión en el pago de los préstamos estatales, lo que le permitirá destinar ese dinero al cuidado de los pacientes en lugar del servicio de la deuda, dijo la oficina de Padilla a CalMatters.
 El Centro Médico Regional El Centro, en el Condado de Imperial, otro centro en el desierto con graves dificultades financieras, recibió 28 millones de dólares a través del Programa de Préstamos para Hospitales en Dificultades el año pasado y recientemente obtuvo una condonación de la deuda de dicho préstamo, según informaron funcionarios estatales. En julio, el Ayuntamiento de El Centro aprobó la venta de dicho centro a un sistema más grande, el Distrito de Salud del Valle Imperial, según informó el Calexico Chronicle.
 El Hospital Palo Verde atiende a los 18,317 residentes de Blythe, a los 2,600 reclusos de la Prisión Estatal de Ironwood y a miles más de la región, declaró Ruiz en una carta a Newsom . Sin él, la atención médica más cercana estaría a unas dos horas de distancia en el Hospital JFK Memorial de Indio y el Centro Médico Colorado River de Needles.
Ruiz dijo que el hospital había enfrentado una cascada de problemas, incluidos litigios, reemplazos de sistemas operativos y un ciberataque, que dejaron al hospital con un flujo negativo de aproximadamente un millón de dólares por mes.
 El cierre de la prisión estatal de Chuckawalla Valley en 2024 provocó una disminución de la población en la ciudad, y las bajas tasas de reembolso de Medi-Cal y de seguros también llevaron a la crisis financiera del hospital, según el Riverside Record.
 No es el único. Los hospitales rurales de California siempre han operado con un margen de beneficio limitado, y varios están al borde del cierre este año, según informó Capitol & Main en junio, añadiendo que «el sistema de salud rural de California ha estado en una situación financiera precaria durante años».",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090225-El-Centro-Hospital-GB-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-03 14:57:18.408431

Sept. 3, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceGathering with lawmakers from both sides of the legislative aisle on Wednesday, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced a renewed push to clamp down on human trafficking in the state while supporting survivors.
Alongside state Reps. Kelly Breen (D-Novi) and Carol Glanville (D-Walker) and state Sens. John Damoose (R-Harbor Springs) and Michael Webber (R-Rochester Hills), Nessel heralded the reintroduction of several policies from previous sessions supporting prosecutors and survivors, as well as new policies from the Michigan Senate boosting penalties for the facilitators of human trafficking. 
“Human trafficking is a crime that thrives in the shadows. It is modern day slavery. Traffickers use force, fraud and coercion to exploit the most vulnerable among us for profit leaving scars that last a lifetime,” Nessel said. “This isn’t an epidemic happening in some far away place. It’s happening right here in Michigan, in our neighborhoods, in our communities and in every corner of our state. No region is immune.”
While Nessel’s office has made prosecuting human trafficking a top priority, the state’s laws continue to receive an “F” rating from Shared Hope International and the Polaris Project, two groups dedicated to bringing an end to human trafficking. 
Survivors of human trafficking still face several barriers that prevent them from healing, rebuilding and reclaiming their futures, Nessel said, as many are charged with crimes they were forced into committing.

Survivors are often left without housing, employment and the protection they need to feel safe, Nessel added, as many more are afraid to come forward out of fear they will be punished rather than protected. 
“We know we cannot end trafficking through prosecution alone. Prevention and victim support must go hand in hand with enforcement,” Nessel said. “We must ensure that when survivors escape, they have a safe place to turn. We must provide legal protection so they are not re-traumatized by the criminal justice system. We must educate the public so that everyone – teachers, doctors, business owners, hotel staff, neighbors – can help identify the warning signs and then act upon them.”
With previous efforts to bolster protections for survivors of human trafficking failing to reach the governor’s desk, Damoose said he chose to act on Nessel’s concerns that the Legislature would never pass meaningful laws on human trafficking. 
While the bills set to be introduced in the Senate will not put an end to human trafficking, Damoose said his goal for the policies is to greatly reduce the number of individuals who would have been trafficked over the next two years. 
Among those reforms are increased penalties for both providers and solicitors of human trafficking, including penalties of up to 20 years for engaging in commercial sex with minors, felony penalties punishable by 20 years in prison and $20,000 fines for various human trafficking offenses, and life in prison for trafficking minors coupled with a $50,000 fine. 
Human trafficking goes beyond sex crimes, Breen said, extending into forced labor and domestic servitude where victims are coerced by threats, fraud, debt bondage and a fear of coming forward. 
“Our current policies and practices, however much good they do, are limited. Survivors are left without support. Families are left without justice. We have a moral responsibility to do better. We need to protect survivors, hold traffickers accountable and give prosecutors the tools they need to build strong cases without re-victimizing people who have already endured trauma,” Breen said.

Changes reintroduced in the house include allowing survivors to have their convictions set aside for crimes committed as a result of trafficking. The legislation also creates an affirmative defense for survivors charged with crimes committed under coercion. 
“These bills build upon reforms championed by Attorney General Dana Nessel and the prior Attorney General Bill Schuette. They ensure survivor statements can be used in court. By doing so, prosecutors will gain the tools they need to dismantle trafficking networks while keeping survivor safety at the center of every case,” Breen said. 
Budgetary concerns
In addition to advocating for movement on these bipartisan policies, Breen and Nessel decried cuts for programs supporting survivors of human trafficking and sexual assault in House Republicans’ proposed budget for the 2025-2026 fiscal year. 
The House’s budget does not include funding requirements for Sexual Assault Kit testing, although these requirements were included in proposals put forth by both Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the Democratic-led Senate. 
The proposal also halves the Department of Attorney General’s general fund compared to the 2024-2025 budget, which Nessel said is used to pay for the department’s work on criminal cases. 
“We’ll be losing 57 special agents. We’ll be losing 13 trial prosecutors and three appellate criminal prosecutors and all of our victim advocates except one.… And I will tell you this as a longtime prosecutor: Yes, prosecutors are important and special agents are important, but no one is more important than victim advocates,” Nessel said. 
Under this level of proposed funding Nessel said she was uncertain if her department would be able to continue work on their Operation Survivor Justice initiative, which connects county prosecutors with funding for extraditing perpetrators of sexual crimes. 
Under the House’s proposal, Nessel said that the department’s address confidentiality program – which has 459 participants – has been effectively defunded. The program aims to protect survivors of domestic violence, sexual violence, and those who have experienced stalking and human trafficking by providing them with a legal mailing address to be used in place of their actual address when an address is needed by a government agency, preventing their abuser from locating them through their voting records or other documentation. 
“If you are really concerned about ensuring that we have the budget we need for all the things that we do, I think it’s important to note, for every $1 that goes to the Department of Attorney General in Michigan, we bring $4 back to the state.…it’s really disappointing, the House Budget, and I’m very, very hopeful that the Senate will stand strong and ensure that that doesn’t ultimately become our budget, and that the governor’s office also appreciates how important it is for us to have a strong budget here,” Nessel said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5431-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-03 14:57:18.408431

(Photo courtesy of the North Dakota Legislative Assembly)A former Republican lawmaker will represent District 25 in southeastern North Dakota, filling the position that has been vacant since Rep. Cindy Schreiber-Beck died in May.
The executive committee for District 25 Republicans selected former Rep. Kathy Skroch, R-Lidgerwood, to complete the remainder of the term. 
Skroch beat out finalists Jason Heitkamp, a former lawmaker and 2024 state superintendent candidate, and former Republican district chair Erik Nygren during the interview process with the district’s executive committee.
“I was completely humbled by the outcome,” Skroch said Wednesday.
Skroch represented District 26 in the Legislature from 2017 to 2022 and narrowly lost her 2022 reelection bid by 85 votes to Rep. Alisa Mitskog, D-Wahpeton, after redistricting combined portions of District 26 with districts 25 and 28.
Appointment of North Dakota lawmaker in limbo amid dispute over district party chair

Schreiber-Beck’s seat had remained vacant because the district’s reorganization meetings during the spring were deemed invalid by the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office, leaving NDGOP District 25 without an official chair or executive committee to make the appointment. The Republican district party was officially reorganized on Aug. 12 with Matt Evans becoming the new district party chair.
Sen. Larry Luick, R-Fairmount, a member of the District 25 executive committee, said he is excited to move on from the district’s leadership “hiccup” and thinks Skroch will represent the area well. 
“She’s very friendly to everybody,” Luick said. “I think we’re going to do just fine.”
He touted her wide-ranging experience as a benefit to her constituents. Skroch is a business owner through Vinnie’s Mud Bog in Lidgerwood, has experience in health care working previously in a geriatric care unit and has an agriculture past through framing and ranching in the area.
“I understand the importance of property rights and landowners’ rights and the impact that occurred with Richland County with the Fargo diversion and now the CO2 pipeline,” Skroch said. “I see the benefits, but I also see the risks to landowners when the big projects come in, or big corporate interests come in.”
She said she’d be willing to serve on any of the interim committees that she is selected for, but she said she believes she can contribute the most on the interim agriculture and human services committees.
Skroch added she could also provide insight on the interim education committee with her experience as a member of the Lidgerwood School Board and putting all seven of her children through the North Dakota public school system.
Grand Forks lawmaker resigns to join North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services

Skroch said she plans on running for election to the seat in 2026.
The North Dakota Legislature also has a vacancy in the Grand Forks area after Rep. Emily O’Brien, R-Grand Forks, resigned to become deputy commissioner of the Department of Health and Human Services.
Sen. Claire Cory, R-Grand Forks, a member of the NDGOP District 42 executive committee, said the district received the official notice of vacancy on Tuesday. The committee is required to meet within 21 days to select O’Brien’s replacement.
Cory said anyone interested in filling the legislative seat should contact NDGOP District 42 Chair Kim Efta or email the district at nddistrict42@gmail.

(Getty Images creative)The Milwaukee County judge accused of helping a man evade arrest by federal immigration authorities this spring is set to go to trial in December. 
Judge Hannah Dugan, who has been charged with federal felony and misdemeanor counts, said on Wednesday she would not appeal a U.S. District Court judge’s decision not to dismiss the case against her — though she reserved the right to appeal later. On Wednesday, federal Judge Lynn Adelman scheduled Dugan’s trial to begin Dec. 15. 
Dugan’s case has become a national example of the Trump administration’s effort to crack down on officials in other branches of government at the local, state and federal levels who are perceived as working against Trump’s aggressive immigration policies. Her April arrest drew widespread condemnation as a threat to judicial independence and criticism of federal Department of Justice officials for publicizing the case before she was even indicted. 
The case stems from what federal prosecutors allege was a deliberate attempt to conceal Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant, from federal authorities. Flores-Ruiz was in Dugan’s courtroom for an appearance in a misdemeanor battery case against him when federal agents arrived with an administrative warrant — which only allowed the agents to operate in the public areas of the Milwaukee County courthouse, not within Dugan’s courtroom. 
Dugan directed Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out a side door of the courtroom, which led them to the same hallway where the agents were standing but not directly past them. An agent rode down in the elevator with Flores-Ruiz and he was later arrested on the street.

(Photoby Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)A group of Latino advocates and researchers in North Carolina have launched a “geospatial database” mapping camps, emergency services and shelters across eastern counties.
The tool is designed to aid farm workers and other Latino workers across the region who may not otherwise know about or have access to resources during hurricanes and severe weather during storm season.
Advocates say some of those workers, who may not speak English or fluent Spanish, remain at higher risk during flooding and storms.
“There is limited access to emergency information in Spanish or the language that they speak,” said Lariza Garzón, the North Carolina director for the Hispanic Federation. “Barriers to adequate housing or health care, or fears tied to immigration status. These communities are too often left out of their response, and left behind in their recovery.”
The database was spurred by research from UNC’s Carolina Population Center, which examined local governments’ plans for disaster preparation and recovery. Many of those plans lacked best practices, particularly when it came to aiding Latino and migrant workers, said Nathan Dollar, director of the center’s Carolina Demography program.
Out of 41 counties surveyed, 14 of them mentioned having Spanish materials in their formal recommended practices, according to Dollar and his colleagues’ research. Nine mentioned translators, and seven mentioned interpreters.

Those written guidelines don’t always reflect the full extent of local operations and plans, Dollar said. But they do signal that gaps remain in actively seeking out Latino and migrant populations in their areas. Some live in ultra-rural regions, at addresses not listed in the state’s central emergency address list.
“We are working with the Department of Labor and others to try to make sure that every registered labor camp is registered with the 911 master address list,” Dollar said.
By the end of the year, the new collective — called Unidos por la Tierra y la Comunidad (United for Land and Community) — hopes to have all 100 counties mapped out.
The database will not be publicly available, but will be provided upon special request to local emergency officials and workers at non-governmental organizations, or NGOs, who have a “verified professional need” to use it, Dollar said.
Still, advocates know that some barriers will be harder to remove while completing the project. Ongoing immigration enforcement has created more distrust of government, Garzón acknowledged, meaning that third-party community leaders would be more important than ever.
“We are hoping that people realize that it would be a big mistake to leave entire communities out of disaster response,” Garzón said. “Especially when it’s our community often who are working towards recovery, rebuilding the homes, fixing electrical issues.”

(Photo by Nick Evans/Ohio Capital Journal)Ron DeSantis does not want former Florida House Speaker Paul Renner to succeed him as governor, he told a packed crowd Wednesday.
“I’m not supporting Paul Renner,” DeSantis said during a Valrico press conference, hours after the Palm Coast Republican filed for the 2026 governor’s race. Renner will face the only other high-profile Republican in the race, Donald Trump-endorsed U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds.
“I think it was an ill-advised decision to enter the race,” DeSantis added.
His blunt take on the 48-year-old’s candidacy stood in contrast to Renner’s campaign launch earlier Wednesday, when the former House Speaker lauded himself as a top GOP figure who played a key role in advancing DeSantis’s agenda.
“As a legislator and Speaker of the House, I stood with Ron DeSantis to brand our state the Free State of Florida. I’m running for Governor so that when the DeSantis era comes to an end, we can defend our victories and solve the challenges that remain,” Renner said in a press release.
DeSantis doesn’t think so.
Less than a year before the gubernatorial primary, Renner is the second high-profile Republican DeSantis has publicly dismissed in the governor’s race. When Trump endorsed Donalds in February for Florida’s top job, DeSantis accused the three-term member of Congress of missing out on Florida’s “wins” during his tenure in Washington.
Still, Renner remains confident that he can “earn the support” of DeSantis as his campaign continues.
“The governor and I had a fantastic partnership making us the Free State of Florida, and I’m confident I’ll earn his support along the way,” he said in a statement to the Florida Phoenix.
DeSantis has yet to formally announce who he does support as a successor. For months, he juxtaposed Donalds and First Lady Casey DeSantis, touting her as a Rush Limbaugh-approved gubernatorial candidate while hinting that she might run. But those rumors faded to a faint whisper after Hope Florida, a charity championed by the First Lady, was barraged with scandalous financial allegations.
Recent reports suggest that Jay Collins, a former state senator elevated by DeSantis as lieutenant governor, will be DeSantis’ picks as his successor.
Renner’s gubernatorial hopes are not new to DeSantis.
In July, as the Jacksonville attorney was touting his pro-DeSantis record on social media, Renner told the governor he wanted to succeed him. The private conversation came after a brutally long legislative session marked by rare infighting between the governor and top GOP lawmakers, when Renner publicly sided with DeSantis on a controversial insurance reform bill.
Citing distaste for diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, the former House Speaker also led the charge to block Santa Ono, a former University of Michigan president, from becoming president of the University of Florida.
A month-and-a-half later, Renner’s plan came to fruition. And evidenced by Wednesday’s pithy public questioning of Renner’s decision making, DeSantis isn’t pleased.

(Photo by Getty Images)North Carolina is falling short in how it serves students with disabilities, according to a 2023-2024 state report on special education presented at Wednesday’s State Board of Education meeting.
The U.S. Department of Education has again labeled the state as “needing assistance,” a designation North Carolina has carried for several years. More than 30 states fall into the same category, but for North Carolina it signals ongoing issues with meeting all federal requirements under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. 
While the label does not cut funding, it means the state must work with federal advisers and report on its progress. If improvements are not made, North Carolina could face a tougher designation of “needs intervention.”
Staffing is one of the biggest challenges North Carolina is facing. Across the state, there are 1,544 open positions for special education teachers. This teacher shortage, with vacancies averaging 10% annually, often means larger caseloads for existing teachers, uncertified staff filling roles, and students missing out on services required in their education plans. Specifically, there are 758 special education openings in elementary schools, 385 in middle schools, and another 401 unfilled positions in high schools. 
Recruitment remains difficult. Fewer than two dozen applicants showed up for a recent job fair.
“I think it’s very challenging,” Dr. Carol Ann Hudgens, senior director of the Office of Exceptional Children, describing how few people are entering the field.
The state has launched new initiatives to address some of the issues. For example, about $2 million has gone out to local districts to support training programs, help with recruitment efforts, and improve retention. Department of Public Instruction (DPI ) officials said districts are tracking which teachers attend professional development sessions to help target support where it’s needed most.
The state is also offering regional training institutes and conferences to better support exceptional children educators.
Despite the recruitment challenges, the report did note some gains. Graduation rates for students with disabilities rose from 62.5% to 66.6%, according to the report.

The State Board of Education is expected to vote on the report’s approval on Thursday before it is submitted to the General Assembly.

DPI identified key priority areas for support, including:

Student performance on statewide assessments
Suspension and expulsion rates
Preschool outcomes
Child find and early childhood transition
Secondary transition and post-school outcomes

The massive tax cut and spending law that Congress passed in July, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,  limited tax credits for green energy projects, such as the two solar farms Evergy received regulatory approval to build in Kansas and Missouri.
Two weeks ago the U.S. Treasury Department published its interpretation of the bill, outlining deadlines for beginning construction and clarifying when certain tax credits would go away. That allowed companies to determine the viability of planned projects. 
“The solar power plants that have been approved by the Kansas and Missouri commissions will be generating electricity for customers in time to qualify for the existing tax credits,” said Gina Penzig, Evergy spokeswoman. 
Joseph Astrab, consumer counsel at the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board, said tax credits are taken into account when determining expected costs on green energy projects. 
“It’s going to be hard to tell what the immediate impacts will be. It’s going to be a process,” he said. “The biggest importance of these tax credits was to help make renewable resources, such as wind or solar, more cost competitive with other types of resources, such as natural gas.”
Astrab said the integrated resource planning, which utility companies complete on a regular basis, will address the effects federal changes will have on how energy is distributed in Kansas. In that process, the companies are considering resources, needs in the generation system and making a future-looking plan, he said.  
“From CURB’s perspective, we’re looking at both trying to balance affordability and reliability,” he said. “But clearly from the public hearings we’ve seen in the past and recently with different rate cases, a lot of people are concerned about affordability.”
“In the last few years, we’ve been able to compare solar and wind projects to thermal projects, including the offset of those tax credits to make it more economical,” Astrab added. “That analysis will change going forward.”
A lot depends on how Evergy will evaluate projects going forward, he said. 
“Looking at Evergy’s 2025 (integrated resource plan), the question becomes whether or not Evergy is going to be shifting away from procuring more solar, renewable types of resources in a system, and falling back on — and I’m not saying it’s a sure thing — more readily accessible, economical natural gas resources and procuring more of those.”
Evergy received approval from the Kansas Corporation Commission to build two new natural gas plants, as well as the Kansas solar field, to the tune of about $2 billion. 
Penzig said Evergy develops a long-term outlook for expected electricity demand every three years and a plan to meet needs.
“We create a plan that will provide reliable electricity for the least expected cost,” she said. “Plans are updated annually between the triennial filings as factors change.”
The plans look at multiple factors that affect generation costs, Penzig said. 
“Some of the most significant impacts include expected demand for electricity, construction costs including any related transmission expansion, fuel, plant maintenance, major plant upgrades, environmental regulation and state or federal policy treatment including tax benefits,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/P1090642-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-03 14:57:18.408431

(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Public health and access to lifesaving vaccines are on the line in a high-stakes leadership battle at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s push to fire CDC director Susan Monarez is more than an administrative shake-up. The firing marks a major offensive by Kennedy to seize control of the agency and impose an anti-vaccine, anti-science agenda that will have profound effects on the lives and health of all Americans, public health leaders say.
Kennedy wants to see the Pfizer and Moderna messenger RNA-based covid-19 vaccines pulled from the market, according to two people familiar with the planning who asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak to the press. He’s also set his sights on restricting or halting access to some pediatric immunizations, some public health leaders say.
His actions have already reduced federal help to states, creating the potential for more infectious disease outbreaks and incidences of foodborne illness. Some public health leaders say they expect Kennedy will use the CDC to publicize health information that isn’t grounded in science.
“It’s crazy season,” said Richard Besser, former acting CDC director during the Obama administration. “People want information they can trust to make critical decisions about their health. Until now, we’ve been able to say look at the CDC. Unfortunately, we’re not able to do that anymore.”
HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard disputed the criticism.
“Secretary Kennedy remains firmly committed to delivering on President Trump’s promise to Make America Healthy Again, dismantling the failed status quo that fueled a nationwide chronic disease epidemic and eroded public trust in our public health institutions,” Hilliard said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Kush Desai said Kennedy and Commissioner of Food and Drugs Marty Makary have reiterated that covid shots will remain available for Americans who need and want them.
“The Trump administration is restoring Gold Standard Science as the sole guiding principle of health decision-making,” Desai said in an email. “Only the Fake News could ignore these facts to continue pushing Democrat talking points and hysteria.”
Behind the ouster
The shake-up began last week, when Kennedy sought to fire Monarez, a microbiologist who’d just been confirmed by the Senate in July. She refused to leave the position, and her lawyers said Kennedy sought to oust her because she wouldn’t fire senior staff or follow unscientific directives. Four top career officials at the CDC resigned on Aug. 27 in protest.
Career staffers at the CDC and some public health groups had hoped President Donald Trump would intervene and put the brakes on Kennedy. Instead, the White House backed Kennedy, saying Monarez was fired.
Trump on Sept. 1 demanded that drug companies show that covid vaccines work, in a further sign he’s not set on defending the shots.
“I hope OPERATION WARP SPEED was as ‘BRILLIANT’ as many say it was. If not, we all want to know about it, and why???” Trump said on Truth Social.
Operation Warp Speed was the initiative that Trump himself announced in 2020 to accelerate the development of covid vaccines, including the Pfizer and Moderna shots. The vaccines have proved safe and effective in multiple clinical trials; a study published in JAMA Health Forum estimated that they saved about 2.5 million lives worldwide.
CDC staffers are worried the agency’s next director won’t fight for science, according to an employee who asked not to be identified for fear of professional retaliation.
Trump’s support for Monarez’s ouster was a watershed moment that signaled there are no checks on Kennedy and his agenda, public health advocates say. Leading congressional Democrats such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for Kennedy’s firing. Hundreds of HHS staffers have also implored Congress to intervene, saying Kennedy threatens science and public health. He is slated to testify Sept. 4 before the Senate Finance Committee.
Kennedy said in a message to CDC staff that his focus is on boosting the agency’s reputation and leadership. The Atlanta-based agency was already reeling after the Trump administration pushed out thousands of its staff and a gunman who reportedly believed the covid vaccine had caused him health problems fired hundreds of rounds at its campus last month, killing a police officer.
“The CDC must once again be the world’s leader in communicable disease prevention. Together, we will restore trust,” Kennedy wrote. “Together, we will rebuild this institution into what it was always meant to be: a guardian of America’s health and security.” He said his deputy, Jim O’Neill, would serve as acting CDC director.
Nine former CDC directors or acting directors who served under both Republicans and Democrats criticized Kennedy in the aftermath of the Monarez firing, saying in an op-ed in The New York Times that the impact on public health is “unacceptable, and it should alarm every American, regardless of political leanings.”
HHS spokesperson Hilliard took exception with this point, listing four covid vaccines that continue to get the nod for use.
However, the Food and Drug Administration last
week approved updated covid mRNA boosters only for people 65 or older and others at high risk of complications. The CDC has also stopped recommending the shots for healthy children and pregnant women. Previously, the shots had been advised for anyone 6 months or older.
As a result, many people who don’t meet the criteria but want the vaccine will have to get prescriptions or consult with their doctors. Insurance may not always cover the shots, which can run around $200. Major drugstores such as Walgreens and CVS have said the shots may not be available at all pharmacies and may require a prescription.
The American Academy of Pediatrics on Aug. 19 broke with the administration, recommending that all young children get the covid vaccine. Insurance still may not cover the cost in some cases and parents could face obstacles in getting the vaccines without a prescription.
Next move: The advisory committee
Kennedy and his team changed official covid vaccine recommendations even though there have been no new safety issues. A dose of the 2023-24 covid mRNA vaccine prevented significant illness and death across all age groups, according to a study published in August led by a University of Michigan researcher. The virus killed about 1,000 people a week in the U.S. in mid-January, and cases are rising again and expected to accelerate this winter.
Kennedy has handpicked a vaccine advisory committee for the CDC that is reviewing mRNA-based covid vaccines, which he falsely claimed in 2021 were “the deadliest vaccine ever made.” The covid vaccine review is being led by Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has said without evidence that the shots cause serious harm, including death. If the committee recommends against them, Kennedy and the FDA could then begin the process of removing them from the market.
Taking mRNA-based covid shots off the market would leave consumers with fewer options for protection. Paxlovid, an antiviral medication that treats the infection in high-risk adults, would be available.
The CDC advisory committee reviewing the covid shots is also probing a long-debunked link between aluminum, used in many childhood immunizations such as those for hepatitis A and pneumonia, and autism or allergies.
The group’s findings are expected to support the erroneous link, some public health officials say. HHS could then require drugmakers to undertake costly reformulations of the shots or stop manufacturing them altogether.
“That would set up the elimination of all childhood vaccines,” Besser said.
The advisory group’s next meeting is set for Sept. 18, although Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) has called for the meeting to be indefinitely delayed. Cassidy, a physician who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, voted for Kennedy’s confirmation as HHS secretary after receiving assurances, he said, that the longtime vaccine opponent wouldn’t disrupt the U.S. vaccination system. Kennedy’s promises, Cassidy said, included that he wouldn’t change the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
Kennedy removed all of the panel’s members in June and replaced them with his own appointees, including anti-vaccine activists.
Kennedy’s move to put his stamp on the CDC means states that have long relied on the agency’s expertise and help in crises such as disease outbreaks will largely be left to fend for themselves, said Ashish Jha, who served as President Joe Biden’s covid response coordinator from 2022 to 2023.
“States are going to be left on their own,” Jha said. “States will struggle with the CDC incapable and dysfunctional. Our system is not designed for states to go it alone.”
The CDC typically plays a critical role by assisting states with disease surveillance, public health interventions, and outbreak response, especially when a crisis spills across state lines. An outbreak of measles this year led to more than 1,400 cases nationwide, and states including Texas, where the outbreak was identified, struggled to get help from the CDC.
A CDC program that has long tracked pathogens in food has already reduced the number of hazards it looks for from eight to two, which public health leaders say is making it harder to identify outbreaks. Staff overseeing a CDC program that tracks outdoor pollution that can exacerbate asthma also have been cut.
The agency runs a hotline that doctors around the country can call to get treatment and other types of advice. Under Kennedy’s watch, the CDC has had to pare assistance because of staffing reductions, said Wendy Armstrong, vice president at the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
“Lives are 100% at stake, no question about it,” Armstrong said. “That you can no longer trust the recommendations out of the CDC is just devastating. It’s appalling to think we can’t trust that information is science-based anymore.”
Kennedy wants to shake up CDC leadership because he sees the agency as the heart of corruption and resistance within the federal health bureaucracy, according to people familiar with his planning. Kennedy has said the agency suffers from malaise and bias.
Many public health leaders, however, view the CDC as under siege by an administration they say is corrupting science for its own ends. HHS staffers signed onto a letter that now has more than 6,800 signatures, saying Kennedy is “endangering the nation’s health by repeatedly spreading inaccurate health information.”
Kennedy has also been fending off mounting criticism of his response to the shooting at the CDC’s headquarters. He responded to the attack on social media, hours later, after first posting pictures of himself fly-fishing.
Some younger staffers are considering leaving and some workers feel like the shooting accelerated Kennedy’s overhaul of the agency, the CDC employee said.
With the battle for control of the CDC still raging, public health leaders are now looking to Congress to put the brakes on Kennedy. Some Republican lawmakers have called for a review of Kennedy’s actions.
“These high profile departures will require oversight by the HELP Committee,” Cassidy said Aug. 27 on the social platform X. Cassidy had backed Monarez to lead the agency.

More police agencies, from big-city departments to federal agencies, are lowering education standards for new recruits — a sign of how much the profession is changing as it struggles to recruit and retain officers.
This year, at least two major city agencies — the New York Police Department and the Dallas Police Department — have cut some education requirements for new recruits.
In February, the NYPD reduced its college credit requirement for police academy entry from 60 credits to 24. Following a new policy approval in June, the Dallas Police Department began allowing applicants with only a high school diploma or GED to qualify if they also have three consecutive years of full-time work experience.

Police agencies nationwide are loosening education requirements in an effort to address years of staffing shortages. The changes also come as President Donald Trump has drawn more attention to crime and public safety by deploying the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, and signaling plans to expand federal enforcement efforts in Chicago and other cities. (A federal judge on Tuesday ruled Trump’s mobilization of U.S. Marines and the California National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles this summer violated federal law.) Trump also has taken over the District of Columbia’s police department.

Reports of violent crime nationwide have been decreasing since 2022. Some communities, though, are still facing higher rates of certain crimes, including homicide.
The changes in New York City and Dallas are part of a yearslong trend of police departments easing college requirements, a shift that includes Boise, Idaho; Chicago; Louisville, Kentucky; New Orleans; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Memphis, Tennessee; and Bellingham, Washington. Even some state police agencies, such as the Kentucky State Police and the Pennsylvania State Police, have followed suit.
But these changes in education requirements aren’t limited to local and state forces. The FBI — which for decades required a four-year degree — will no longer mandate one for new recruits starting in October. New recruits also will receive just eight weeks of training, down from the previous 18-week standard, according to The New York Times.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also has loosened standards as the Trump administration seeks to expand immigration enforcement. The agency removed its five-week Spanish-language training requirement. Translation needs would instead be met through unspecified technology, The Intercept reported.
ICE has paired these changes with aggressive incentives, including signing bonuses of up to $50,000, as much as $60,000 in student loan repayment and retirement benefits.
These changes reflect a broader challenge in policing: Agencies are still struggling to recruit and retain officers amid increased public attention and shifting workforce expectations.
“The demand exceeds the supply, and what’s happened is the environment for being a police officer has changed,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a national nonprofit think tank on policing standards. “The expectations have never been higher.”
Resignations and retirements rose sharply after 2020, when nationwide protests put law enforcement under closer public scrutiny following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. Additionally, some officers are leaving big-city departments for smaller agencies. At the same time, some experts say, police agencies are competing in a tight labor market in which shift jobs may be less appealing than positions with regular hours, higher pay or remote work options.
In recent years, the push for better-educated officers has been rooted in research suggesting that college graduates are less likely to use force and perform better on the job. But some say that strict education mandates can shrink the applicant pool and shouldn’t be the sole measure of what makes a good officer.

“College education, in the greater scheme of things, is advantageous. It’s necessary, but not sufficient,” Wexler said, noting that agencies should also weigh a recruit’s work history, maturity, judgement and other characteristics.
Agencies of all sizes also have adjusted other standards to attract more applicants — raising or lowering minimum age limits, loosening tattoo policies, scaling back fitness tests and waiving exam fees.
In some departments, these changes have sparked a surge in applications, but they haven’t always translated into higher staffing levels overall.
Following the NYPD’s announcement in February that it was changing its education requirement, daily applications jumped from an average of 53 to 231, according to a news release. In early August, the agency swore in 1,093 recruits — its largest incoming class since January 2016.
The New Orleans Police Department nixed its college education requirement in 2015 and saw a surge of 7,440 applications just two years later.
But hiring never kept pace: The department brought on about 100 recruits a year, and far fewer after 2020, according to the city’s hiring dashboard. In 2024, the department received 1,575 applications and hired just 35 recruits.
A report from the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s office released late last year found that between 2019 and 2023, the department lost nearly 27% of its policing staff.

Solving the staffing crisis

Staffing shortfalls have been a long-standing challenge for law enforcement agencies, stretching back well before 2020. But in recent years, hiring has improved in some parts of the country.
The latest Police Executive Research Forum survey, based on responses from 217 agencies across 39 states and the District of Columbia, suggests staffing trends are uneven.
As of Jan. 1, sworn staffing was up slightly from the year before but still 5.2% below 2020 levels, according to the survey. Large departments saw modest growth in 2024 but still employ 6% fewer officers than in 2020, while medium and small agencies have not just recovered but now surpass 2020 levels.
“This period we’re in now, and we have been in for the last few years, is the most challenging time to hire a police officer,” Wexler said.

In recent years, state legislatures also have looked into the education requirements for police. In 2023, for example, Oregon lawmakers considered a bill that would have required at least two years of higher education for departments with fewer than 50 officers and a bachelor’s degree for departments with more than 50. It would have applied to police, corrections, parole, probation and reserve officers, but the bill stalled in a Senate committee.
More recently, lawmakers in California are considering a bill that would, starting in 2031, require incoming officers to obtain a policing certificate, associate degree or bachelor’s degree within 36 months of graduating from a police academy. Incoming officers could also meet the requirement through prior military service or out-of-state law enforcement experience.
The proposal has received widespread support from many law enforcement agencies and groups in the state, including the California Police Chiefs Association, California State Sheriffs’ Association and the Peace Officers Research Association of California.
The sheriffs’ association praised the legislation, writing in a statement that it offers a range of acceptable experiences — “enhancing academic rigor” — without burdensome requirements that could hurt agencies’ recruiting goals.
Police education requirements are often set by individual departments or local jurisdictions, rather than written into state law. Across the country, most local law enforcement agencies require only a high school diploma or GED, though officers with a college degree may have more opportunities for promotions and higher pay.
“Educational standards across law enforcement agencies vary considerably,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University.
Some agencies also have created pathways for new officers to earn college credit through completing the police academy program and offer tuition reimbursement for those who want to pursue advanced degrees.
But La Vigne told Stateline that in-service training, organizational structure, leadership and accountability mechanisms within a department also play a key role in shaping a well-rounded officer.
“Those factors, I think, override anything as simple as ‘We’re requiring or removing education as a threshold for employment,’” La Vigne said. “Educational requirements alone are not the biggest factor.”

What makes a good cop

What makes a good police officer has long been debated, with discussions often centering on the role of education, training and personal qualities.










Having a college education by itself doesn’t mean you will be a better police officer.


– Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Research Executive Forum


Some argue that, rather than lowering education requirements, departments should improve people’s perceptions of the police by becoming more involved in the community, especially at a time when heightened scrutiny has made the job less appealing to some.
“It’s trying to fix the problem assuming that the way things work now is the way things are supposed to be,” said Jim Nolan, a sociology professor at West Virginia University and a speaker with the nonprofit Law Enforcement Action Partnership. Nolan previously served as a police officer and as an FBI unit chief. “It’s the approach to policing that’s wrong.”
Some research suggests that college-educated officers use force less often, face fewer complaints and are disciplined less frequently than their peers without a degree. Some policing experts say a college education may give officers a broader perspective on a range of issues while also strengthening critical thinking and teamwork skills.
Research also suggests that college-educated officers are stronger writers, which can lead to clearer investigations and casework, according to a 2017 report on higher education in policing.
But some experts still caution that the research is not conclusive and argue that education alone isn’t enough to determine what makes a good police officer.
“Having a college education by itself doesn’t mean you will be a better police officer,” said Wexler, of the Police Executive Research Forum.

They also voted to start the process to hire their next board secretary by posting the open position.
Two absent board members, Sarah Lepak and Zachary Archer, had scheduling conflicts with the atypical meeting date and time, Tinney said.
Walters’ office did not explain why he was absent. Instead, his spokesperson, Madison Cercy, said Walters “is focused on tackling the big issues facing Oklahoma schools and is pleased to welcome Ryan Leonard to the team.”

An already rocky relationship with the board further devolved over the month of August as board members pushed to hire an attorney of their choosing and asked for input on their meeting agendas. Meanwhile, a law enforcement investigation has been pending into two board members’ reports of seeing nude women on a TV in Walters’ office during their July meeting. 
Walters ultimately canceled the board’s pre-scheduled Aug. 28 meeting, citing transitioning staff and legal counsel.
The cancellation put on hold important work the board is meant to accomplish on a monthly basis, some members said.
For example, Carson said several Oklahoma educators are being paid like substitute teachers because the state board hasn’t yet approved their emergency certifications, which would grant them the higher wages of a certified teacher.
“That is concerning to me,” she told news reporters after the meeting. “Because we didn’t meet, we’ve affected their livelihood.”
Before canceling the August meeting, Walters voiced no specific concerns with the attorney the board members wished to hire, Van Denhende said after the board adjourned Wednesday. Rather, Van Denhende suggested “it has to do with control.”
Walters enjoyed no dissent from the board for his first two years in office. But as his relationship with Gov. Kevin Stitt soured early this year, the governor appointed four new members who have been willing to publicly disagree with Walters and call his policies into question.
Van Denhende said working with the state superintendent has been like “hand-to-hand combat.”
“I don’t know how much more difficult a man can make things,” Van Denhende said.

Carrying out the meeting Wednesday was a feat, the board members said, and they didn’t rule out having to schedule another.
The four present members leaned on a state law that allows a majority of the board to call a special meeting. They worked with local attorney Bob Burke to prompt the Education Department to post the meeting agenda, under threat of litigation.
The meeting itself required a patchwork of state agencies.
The Commission for Educational Quality and Accountability lent its board secretary and an employee to help facilitate the meeting. The deputy general counsel from the Office of Management and Enterprise Services was there in case the board needed legal advice. State Senate staff prepared and directed the facility.
Education Secretary Nellie Tayloe Sanders, representing the Governor’s Office, posted the meeting agenda through the Secretary of State’s Office. 
She said the meeting was “critical” for the board to hire necessary employees to help carry out its basic functions.
Board members also credited the Attorney General’s Office for its help as they sought new legal counsel.
Hiring a new attorney who is aligned with the full board, not only with Walters, is an improvement, Van Denhende said, but “there’s no promise that anything’s going to change” without the state superintendent’s cooperation.
“We needed to have the August meeting, and we didn’t have it,” he said. “It was a struggle to have this meeting. So, who knows how we’re going to actually address the real business of the state schools.”

(Photo by Jordan Gale/Oregon Capital Chronicle)With a key Democratic senator recovering from surgery, the Oregon Senate will delay a planned vote on a transportation tax package for two weeks.
The House narrowly passed the 10-year, $4.3 billion package Monday, and a Senate vote was scheduled for Wednesday. But on Tuesday evening, Senate Democrats announced that they would delay the vote until Sept. 17, when they expect Sen. Chris Gorsek, D-Gresham, to be available.
Raising taxes requires support from 18 of 30 senators, and Democrats hold 18 seats. That means all Democrats need to be present if Republicans remain united against the transportation bill. Gorsek underwent back surgery in August and is recovering from complications of that surgery, Democratic leaders said.
“We have been in constant communication with Sen. Gorsek and his team as he works to recover from complications relating to a planned back surgery,” Senate President Rob Wagner, D-Lake Oswego, said in a statement Tuesday. “My understanding is that it would be unsafe for Sen. Gorsek to be away from medical care at this time.”
A Sept. 17 vote means the bill cannot pass until after Sept. 15,  when hundreds of Oregon Department of Transportation workers were slated to be laid off pending legislative intervention. Kotek on Tuesday ordered layoffs be delayed until Oct. 15 again only if the transportation tax package fails final passage in the Senate.
“This date will make sure there are no interruptions for the hundreds of workers whose jobs hang in the balance and the basic services that Oregonians rely on,” Kotek said in a statement.
Melissa Unger, executive director of the Service Employees International Union Local 503 that represents many of the affected employees, said workers appreciate the security of knowing no one will lose their jobs for another month, but that lawmakers need to do better.
“When one of our workers calls out sick, someone will step up and do their job,” she said. “And I think right now, we really believe that we need to give workers security. They have been facing unknown timelines, unknown votes for the past two months about whether they get to save their jobs.”
The Oregon Department of Transportation faces an immediate $300 million shortfall in the two-year budget cycle that began July 1, because lawmakers failed to pass a transportation funding plan during the recent six-month legislative session. Kotek in July announced that the department would lay off 483 workers and close a dozen maintenance stations, but she postponed the effective date of layoffs after calling lawmakers back in a special session.
Wren Gilson, an ODOT senior application developer who received a layoff notice in July, held back tears while talking to reporters about an hour after learning of the delay. About half of Gilson’s team, who work on software for the Motor Vehicles Division and compile data, received layoff notices, and at least one person on the team left state employment because of  the uncertainty over department funding.
“I definitely feel like my job is being held hostage for some political game, and I just wish that there was something that I could do or say, or anything that would help get people to just make this happen,” Gilson said.
The House on Labor Day passed an amended version of Kotek’s proposed plan, including a 6-cent gas tax increase, hikes to vehicle title and registration fees and temporarily doubling a statewide payroll tax for transit from one-tenth of 1% to two-tenths of 1%.
Under that plan, the payroll tax increase would cost a worker who earns the statewide average salary of $68,283 about $68 per year, and drivers of passenger vehicles would pay $84 more on their two-year car registration. The gas tax impact would vary depending on how many miles people drive and how fuel-efficient their cars are.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-03 17:51:17+00:00,CT Mirror,CT’s indexed minimum wage going to $16.94 in January,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/03/ct-minimum-wage-rises/,"Gov. Ned Lamont said CT's new hourly minimum wage will go into effect Jan. 1. Only Calif., Wash. and N.Y. have higher rates.","Connecticut’s hourly minimum wage will increase from $16.35 to $16.94 on Jan. 1, based on the third annual adjustment since the state pegged the wage to the federal employment cost index, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Wednesday.
The adjustment will keep Connecticut among the states with the highest minimum wages, a consequence of a law signed by Lamont in 2019 that gradually raised the $10.10 minimum until it reached $15 in 2023, then shifted to the index.
“Nobody who works full-time should have to live in poverty,” Lamont said in a statement. “For too long, as the nation’s economy grew the income of the lowest earning workers has stayed flat, making already existing pay disparities even worse and preventing hardworking families from obtaining financial security.”
The new calculation, which was announced more than a month ahead of the statutory deadline of Oct. 15,  comes as the Democratic governor is trying to smooth relations with labor ahead of a decision on seeking a third term in 2026.
Lamont signed the minimum wage law during his first year office, the first of several pro-labor initiatives passed with his support. But he vetoed a bill that would have provided jobless benefits for strikers and has opposed increasing taxes on upper earners, angering the Connecticut AFL-CIO.
The state’s largest business group, the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, opposes the increase as an unnecessary interference with a competitive labor market that it says requires paying between $18 and $22 an hour to attract entry-level workers.
“It’s just such a competitive environment,” said Chris DiPentima, the president and chief executive of CBIA. “Obviously businesses are doing everything they can with higher minimum wages and flexible benefits.”
The governor’s announcement came on the same day CBIA released to annual business survey. DiPentima said Connecticut remains in top five of states as measured by wages and wage growth.
“The minimum wage was established to provide a fair, livable baseline of income for those who work,” Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz said. “This is a fair, gradual increase for workers that ensures that as the economy grows, our minimum wage grows with it — and that’s good for everyone.”
Connecticut currently has the fourth highest state minimum wage, behind $16.66 in Washington and $16.50 in California and most of New York. Massachusetts and Rhode Island require a minimum wage of $15.
“Indexing minimum wage to the employment cost index helps protect the most vulnerable earners from inflation and cost increases, and it helps keeps wage gaps from widening,” said Dante Bartolomeo, commissioner of labor.
Connecticut’s new minimum will be four pennies higher than the $16.90 taking effect on the same day in California. Washington state will announce its indexed 2026 rate at the end of September.
There are higher minimum wages in some metro areas. It is $17.55 in the District of Columbia.
Connecticut currently has about 70,000 open jobs. It’s unemployment rate for July was 3.8%, up from 3.1% a year earlier.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/231121_EEP_Ridgefield-small-businesses5-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-03 13:58:25.732716

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Despite the assistance of armed troops in U.S. cities, federal immigration officials recorded fewer daily arrests in August than in July and remain well short of a Trump administration plan for 3,000 arrests a day, according to a new report.
As of Aug. 29, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests averaged 1,055 a day for the month, down 14% from 1,124 a day in July, according to data obtained by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. The organization tracks federal immigration data.
“President Trump’s orders recently assigning substantial personnel from the national guard and the U.S. military to target Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. may have been counter-productive in failing to increase total arrests countrywide,” said Susan B. Long, co-founder of TRAC and a professor in the Whitman School of Management, in an e-mail statement.
In a Tuesday decision a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration’s deployment of Marines and National Guard units to Southern California, where they assisted with immigration and other arrests, was illegal.
In May, Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, told Fox News that the administration was “looking to set a goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests for ICE every day and President Trump is going to keep pushing to get that number up higher.”
ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced it would give more financial incentives to state and local police to cooperate with ICE, including reimbursement for salary and benefits for officers trained in the 287(g) program to assist ICE in making arrests, and “performance awards” for “successful location of illegal aliens.”
“By joining forces with ICE, you’re not just gaining access to these unprecedented reimbursement opportunities — you’re becoming part of a national effort to ensure the safety of every American family,” ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan said in a statement.

The state has $14 million less to spend on hazard mitigation and rebuilding from wildfires following an unexplained FEMA cut in late July, according to state officials. (Photo by Danielle Prokop / Source NM)The Federal Emergency Management Agency cut $14 million from funding it previously promised to New Mexico to deal with the fallout of the South Fork and Salt fires near Ruidoso, according to documents the state’s emergency management department gave Source New Mexico on Wednesday.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency in December told the state that it would receive about $30 million in Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funding. But in late July, the state received new correspondence from FEMA showing the number reduced to $16 million, according to emails and financial statements the state’s Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management provided to Source. 
Democratic Attorneys General late last week updated their complaint against the Trump administration in a lawsuit over whether the Federal Emergency Management Agency can refuse to spend pre-disaster mitigation grants approved by Congress.
New Mexico’s grant funding is tied to the presidential disaster declaration from last summer’s South Fork and Salt fires, which damaged or destroyed more than 1,400 structures and also ushered in devastating post-fire flooding that killed three people earlier this year. 
Ruidoso and Mescalero officials seek state help as communities face post-fire flooding

The program provides funding so that states can “develop hazard mitigation plans and rebuild in a way that reduces, or mitigates, future disaster losses in their communities,” according to the FEMA website. 
A FEMA spokesperson did not immediately respond to Source New Mexico’s request for comment on why it cut the state’s funding. 
The $14 million cut is in addition to slightly more than $4 million in cuts from another FEMA program, Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, that the federal agency abruptly ended in April. 
The AGs’ updated 83-page complaint said FEMA hadn’t made a single award to the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program between April 2 and Aug. 25. The New Mexico AG’s office detailed in the filing how FEMA ending the BRIC program would undermine the state’s plan to mitigate extreme temperatures, as well as Acoma Pueblo’s initiative to reduce flooding risk, among other efforts. 
Democratic AGs disclose FEMA failed to make grants for months to critical disaster program

The $4 million BRIC cuts are “exacerbated” by the $14 million funding reduction, the AG’s office wrote in the lawsuit, saying the $14 million funding was intended for wildfires and post-fire flooding. 
New Mexico is the only state of 21 in the lawsuit that mentions cuts to both BRIC and Hazard Mitigation programs. 
In an email, DHSEM spokesperson Danielle Silva did not describe why the funding may have been cut, but she said the cut is significant. She did not respond to a request for more details Wednesday morning. 
“The loss of the $14 million will mean we have that much less to spend on new projects across the state,” she said.
According to the latest updates, FEMA has provided about $31.5 million to public entities like state and local governments to help recover from the disasters, along with about $8 million to individuals and families. 
It’s also approved $1.5 million for the Hazard Mitigation program, according to the FEMA website.
In May, DHSEM officials told Source that the state currently received hundreds of millions of dollars in FEMA grants, including an estimated $148 million from the Hazard Mitigation program. Deputy Secretary Ali Rye said at the time New Mexico “as a state would struggle” if FEMA were to completely cut all its grants.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ZAM1084-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-03 13:58:25.732716
,Mississippi Today,2025-09-03 17:39:01+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Brandon residents want answers, guarantees about data center",Katherine Lin,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/03/data-center-petition-brandon-mississippi-environment-pollution-energy/,Mississippi has two large-scale data center projects underway in Meridian and Madison County and another planned for Brandon. Residents in Brandon have started a petition over concerns about the center planned there.,"Residents of Brandon have raised concerns about the environmental impact and safety of a data center planned for their city.
AVAIO Digital, a Connecticut-based company, announced Aug. 19 that it plans to build a data center in Rankin County. While some celebrated the $6-billion investment and the over $20 million in annual tax revenue it would bring, other residents worry about the data center’s water and power consumption and possible pollution. The 600,000-square-foot facility is expected to be completed by 2027. 
‘People genuinely just want answers’
When Nathan Rester first saw the news about the data center, he was immediately concerned. Rester grew up in Brandon and now lives there with his wife and toddler just a few miles from where the data center will be built.

Rester had followed reports about the air pollution that people in and around Memphis have reported, a result of XAI constructing gas turbines without pollution controls normally used for such turbines. He didn’t want to see what was happening in Memphis happen in Brandon.
His wife, Larkyn Collier, made calls but found the answers unsatisfying.
“ No one could really give a straight answer on how it was being built, what sort of precautions were being taken, whether or not there had been any sort of consideration for utility costs or pollutants or anything like that,” Rester said
In response, Collier and Rester started a petition on change.org that now has over 430 signatures. The petition asks Rankin County leaders to guarantee the data center will not cause such problems. So far they have not received any communication from Rankin or Brandon government officials.
Rester is not completely opposed to the data center being built but he wants the government to guarantee it won’t bring utility bill hikes or pollution.
“ People genuinely just want answers and transparency here. And they want safeguards in place,” Rester said. 
The AI boom comes to Mississippi
At their most basic level, data centers store computing equipment. They have been around since the 1940s and power things such as cloud storage. But with the boom in artificial intelligence investment, companies are rapidly constructing data centers across the globe.
The investment bank UBS estimates $375 billion will be spent globally on artificial intelligence in 2025. While this investment has fueled economic and technological growth, data centers have faced skepticism in the communities where they’re built, largely due to the amounts of energy and water they consume and possible pollution they emit.
Mississippi has two large-scale data center projects underway – Compass Datacenters in Meridian and Amazon in Madison County. Including the AVAIO data center, the three will add up to over $26 billion in new capital investment, an unprecedented amount for the state. 
Cities and states are embracing data centers because of the potential economic growth, new taxes and innovation they bring.
“This investment is poised to create a lasting, positive impact on the city and the wider region,” Brandon Mayor Butch Lee said in a statement to Mississippi Today. “The project represents a major step forward for Brandon, bringing high-tech jobs and economic growth that will resonate throughout Rankin County and beyond.” 
When the property is on the tax rolls and fully up and running, the ad valorem tax will bring in an estimated $23 million in new revenue according to Rankin First, the county’s economic development group. Most of it will go to the local school district.
“ These are not here today. And if we didn’t win this project, we would never see those,” said Garrett Wright, executive director of Rankin First, about tax revenue from the data center.
Rankin First, similar to many economic development groups, is not part of county government and is hired to attract new investment and cultivate existing businesses. It owns the land that the data center will be built on, which has been vacant for around 20 years. 
AVAIO is eligible for the state’s data center tax incentive and fee in lieu of property tax. Companies pay a negotiated fee for a set period of time instead of the full property tax. The incentive is designed to encourage economic development. It requires sign off from the county board of supervisors, municipal authorities and Mississippi Development Authority, the state’s economic development agency. 
It’s estimated AVAIO will create 60 direct jobs and the Amazon data center 300-400 direct jobs. While data centers create relatively few permanent, direct jobs they create additional jobs in the community. A McKinsey and Company report found that for every direct data center job, approximately 3.5 more jobs are created in the community. 
Some residents on social media have wondered whether the data center will negatively impact traffic. Traffic and grade separation of the rail lines have been key conversations as Rankin County has grown. Rankin First acknowledged that AVAIO’s presence will increase traffic but they see it as an opportunity to push for long needed infrastructure improvements.
Rankin First and Brandon have been working with AVAIO for two years and says the company is coming to Brandon, in part, because of the thriving community.
“ The company wants to be a community partner. We see that they’re going to get involved with the local community,” said Regina Todd, assistant director of Rankin First. 
Brandon residents want answers
Bailey Henry has lived in Brandon for over a decade. She said that when she read about the new data center on social media, she became concerned.
“ I’ve lived in Mississippi the majority of my life and I was raised to leave things better than you found it,” Henry said. “ And I just don’t think that Mississippi is going to be better off from this.”
Henry is worried about the pressure the data centers will put on the city’s infrastructure, pollution and power demands. 
She describes the announcement as “ brief and nonchalant as all the explanations have been. From politicians to people who work for Entergy.  It has just been, ‘This is what it is. It’s going to be great. Don’t ask any questions.’” 
Henry has made calls to and left voicemails with multiple government offices and has not had heard back from any of them. 
She’s skeptical, but she hopes she’s wrong.
Brandon concerns echo nationwide conversation
The biggest concerns from residents nationwide over data centers has been potential pollution and increases in utility bills. Across the country, there are stories about data centers driving up energy rates, worsening water shortages, polluting the air and creating a constant noise. 
AI data centers demand massive amounts of electricity and run constantly. The average AI data center uses as much electricity as 100,000 households, according to a report from the International Energy Agency.
Another concern is water usage. Data centers need to stay at a specific temperature, and water is one of the most efficient ways to cool the servers. The IEA report found that the average AI data center needs about 528,000 gallons of water every day. For communities that already have water concerns, data centers can exacerbate the problems. 
Some communities have blamed the increased demand from data centers for rising electricity bills. While part of these costs may be due to general inflation or paying for infrastructure upgrades, some states are trying to monitor or regulate how households are affected. 
A data center’s impact can vary based on the design of the center. But by their very nature they consume a lot of power. 
“ AI chips are very power hungry. We’re building a lot of computing capacity, so we need to power all of this,” said Ahmed Saeed, a computer science assistant professor at Georgia Tech.
AVAIO promised “sustainable design,” including rainwater collection and solar panels that would “minimize power demands.” But it’s still unclear what, if any, impact the new data center will have on Rankin County residents. 
“ Having clarity on the impact of data centers within the community where they’re building is important,” Saeed said. Saeed believes data centers are here to stay and are key for innovation. But he also thinks there’s a need for more government regulation.
“ They’re not necessarily a negative thing, but on the flip side, in order to make sure that they’re net positive it’s hard to ensure that without some regulation,” Saeed said.

Phil Murphy said the state will spend almost $11 million to support services with waiting lists or at risk because of federal funding cuts. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy said New Jersey will spend nearly $11 million in national opioid settlement funds on community-based addiction treatment for uninsured people, peer counseling, and recovery support for pregnant and postpartum women struggling with addiction.
A state council that advises policymakers how to best spend settlement funds selected those services for funding because they have proven effective in the state’s ongoing fight to reduce drug overdoses and yet have waiting lists or risk closure with federal funding cuts and no alternate sources of funding, officials said.
The council acted similarly in 2023 when it recommended officials spend $500,000 to fight the growing prevalence of xylazine, an additive known as “tranq” or “the zombie drug” because of the sores and stupor it induces in users.
Services that will receive $10.85 million in funding include:

$4.3 million for community-based addiction treatment for uninsured people. About 1,000 uninsured people each month are admitted to community-based recovery programs.
$3.5 million over 2.5 years to continue a checkup program in which peer recovery specialists follow up with people who have completed treatment to ensure they’re living independently and drug-free.
$2 million for such specialists to support people in inpatient programs, halfway houses, and other short- and long-term residential placements.
Almost $1.1 million to extend a maternal wraparound program that serves pregnant and postpartum women in addiction recovery.

New Jersey is set to receive more than $1.1 billion over the next two decades from pharmaceutical companies, which agreed to pay billions in lawsuit settlements to atone for their role in the deadly opioid epidemic. The state will get half of that funding, while counties and local municipalities will get the other half. The new spending announced Tuesday is on top of $120 million the state allocated last year of its share.
Both the state and at least one local government have faced criticism this year for how they have used the settlement funds.
State lawmakers infuriated harm reduction advocates and the state attorney general in June when they diverted $45 million in settlement funds to four hospitals to offset expected Medicaid cuts. Local spending drew scrutiny after the state comptroller’s office denounced Irvington’s use of $632,000 in settlement funds on “opioid awareness” concerts, rather than direct services for people struggling with addiction.
Sarah Adelman is commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Human Services and chairs the New Jersey Opioid Recovery and Remediation Advisory Council. The funding announced Tuesday is “vital for helping people build stability and sustain long-term recovery,” she said.
“This most recent investment will bring life-saving support to individuals and families affected by addiction. It will expand access to essential treatment and recovery services, including support for expecting mothers during pregnancy and up to a year after birth, which is such a critical time for both mothers and babies,” Adelman said in a statement.

Before her entry into politics, Letlow was a top administrator at the University of Louisiana at Monroe. She ran for Congress in 2021 to replace her husband, Luke Letlow, who died in from COVID-19 five days before he would have been sworn into office. Julia Letlow has won re-election in 2022 and 2024.
Though Letlow was considered a top candidate for the LSU job, she is also hearing calls to enter next year’s U.S. Senate election as a primary challenger against Bill Cassidy. She has not yet announced whether she will enter the race.  
LSU is now officially accepting applications for its top position, which will not be split despite months of speculation that the LSU Board of Supervisors would separate the president and chancellor jobs. 
A listing that went up late last week on HigherEdJobs.com and other higher education job websites says the LSU president leads “as the chief executive for both the LSU System and the LSU A&M campus.” 
The ad was posted three months after former President William Tate announced he was vacating the position for the same job at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Tate left the job amid rumors LSU would split the president and chancellor positions, which were combined in 2012. 
Multiple LSU board members confirmed to the Illuminator they were having discussions about splitting the roles, but LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard said in an interview last spring he did not believe it was necessary. 
In addition to Letlow, several other Louisiana candidates are rumored to be considering applying for the job. 
McNeese President Wade Rousse said he will make a decision about whether he will apply for the LSU position when he returns from traveling to the Southland Conference meetings in Dallas this week. Rousse is favored for the job by LSU Board Vice Chairman Lee Mallett, who is a close ally of Gov. Jeff Landry,
Interim LSU President Matt Lee, who is also a potential candidate for the permanent job, has not yet responded to a request for comment. 
The LSU job is likely to draw applicants from across the country. The search committee last month announced LSU had hired a local executive search firm to lead the process.

(Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)The Joint Committee on Employment Relations unanimously approved pay raises for state and University of Wisconsin employees Wednesday morning, but not without criticism from the top Assembly Republican of Gov. Tony Evers’ decision to implement them ahead of the committee. 
The budget — passed by the Republican-led Legislature and signed by Evers in early July — included a 3% pay increase in the first year of the budget and a 2% increase in the second year. Evers, seeking to get the pay raises to employees as soon as possible, instructed the Department of Administration (DOA) to implement the raises without getting the additional go-ahead from the committee in mid-August. 
DOA Deputy Secretary Anne Hanson told the committee that the raises should be reflected in paychecks starting this week.
“When the Wisconsin Supreme Court clarified that the state separation of power doctrine in Evers v. Marklein last year, it became clear that the implementation of raises established and funded by the state budget legislation would no longer necessitate separate approval by a legislative committee under the direction of Gov. Evers,” Hanson said. “DOA staff worked quickly to carry out the law.”
The Evers v. Marklein case centered on the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship program and projects being blocked by the Joint Finance Committee. The Court found 6-1 that it was unconstitutional for the committee to withhold already appropriated funds for the program. 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) complained about Evers’ actions before the committee voted Wednesday, saying the Evers administration is “drunk with power” and is upending a process “that has literally worked for generations.” 
“Really seems like rather than trying to be collaborative and go through the normal process where Republicans, Democrats, legislators, executive branch, all sit down and work out a deal, they’re just going to try to impose their will on the state, which will mean unfortunately that during the next budget discussion, it will be dramatically different,” Vos said. “It’s really a shame that the Evers administration has decided to play politics with it and do something which is clearly outside the scope of norm and what should be outside the scope of the law.” 
The conflict over the powers of the Legislature and of the executive branch goes beyond the implementation of pay raises. Republicans lawmakers are also trying to stop the implementation of administrative rules by the Evers administration, which was seeking to put some in action without going through the Joint Committee for Review of Administrative Rules. Evers in this case cited another recent state Supreme Court decision as clarifying his authority.
Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) and Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine), the Democrats on the committee, did not speak to the issue, though Hesselbein said she is concerned that the pay for employees isn’t enough. 
“I’m glad we’re doing this adjustment, but I would like to note after a conversation with representatives of hard-working men and women throughout the state providing public services… that the compensation for the average state employee does remain 18% below inflation since 2012,” Hesselbein said. “While this is a small step in the right direction, we have a lot more to do.”

(Photo courtesy of Grinnell College)When students step onto campus for the first time as a college freshman, that moment can represent the culmination of months of stress and hard work. The weeks following that moment are among the most important in a student’s college career, said Jerry Seaman, special advisor to the president for strategy at Grinnell College.
Once a student starts college, Seaman said they want to be successful — getting to know and getting along with roommates, finding faculty that will inspire them and making enough connections across campus to feel like they’ve really put down roots.
“That happening in the first six weeks we know is critical to students becoming comfortable and being their best selves and doing their best work as students,” Seaman said.
However, some students struggle with finding their place and feeling comfortable on campus, according to Seaman and a decades-old theory of college culture shock. Grinnell College is piloting a program to invite students to get involved in campus activities and resources and help them feel more at home, sooner.

RSVP, or “Retention Student Success Validation and Progression,” is a program developed by Grinnell to connect staff, faculty and leadership from the college with groups of new students to help them engage in the goings-on of campus in their first six weeks at the college.
Seaman said the point of the program is not to teach students what they need to be successful or to “upskill” them for their future careers, but to emphasize to them that there are people on campus who care and will help when needed, even if it seems as simple as an invite to a meal or event.
“College, yes, is obviously a series of challenges and achievements and accomplishments, each of which build on each other until the student finally graduates,” Seaman said. “But I think you can see college also as a series of invitations, right? They’re everywhere. They’re in front of you, they’re in plain sight. So we’re elevating the idea of invitation.”
In developing the RSVP program, Seaman said the university used the W-curve model to better understand students’ experiences during their first six weeks at college and plot out what could help them settle in faster and more comfortably.
According to the Mayo Clinic Health System, the W-curve describes the usual ups and downs students can have in their initial time on campus and splits them into different categories. The model starts with the honeymoon period, when students are excited to dive into college, before culture shock sets in and things become more complicated, causing or increasing homesickness in some.
“Lots of data are telling us that during the first weeks after their arrival at Grinnell College, first-year students are feeling very much like guests,” said Joe Bagnoli, Grinnell vice president for enrollment and dean of admissions, in a press release about RSVP. “It’s a universal feeling in a new academic environment – you don’t know where to put down your stuff, how to navigate between where you’re staying, places to eat, and assigned classroom spaces.  And when you get to your destination, you sometimes feel unsure about what you are supposed to do.”
Settling in comes after culture shock, then “mental isolation,” according to the May Clinic Health System, when students compare home and school and can feel like they don’t belong in either. The final stage of the curve is “acceptance and integration,” when students are getting more involved on campus and have a better understanding of what to do and expect.
As the program is in its first year, Seaman said the university is starting out with three groups of 12 students, grouped by their “tutorial” — a first-year course all students must take that establishes a faculty member as their advisor and teaches skills in critical thought and reading through a variety of topics.
Group hosts will invite their students to attend popular events on campus, like sporting events, arts and music performances and more. The program also has an incentive system to encourage students who would normally pass on these activities to attend.
Seaman emphasized that RSVP is not meant to place additional burdens on students who already work hard and have a lot on their plates, but to help them relieve some pressure and create connections.
“Obviously students can say, ‘you know what, I opt out,’ but we think there’s a value to opting in,” Seaman said. “I think there’s value to getting to know other students, other faculty, other staff, other opportunities. These invitations are out there for every individual student already, we’re just trying to elevate them for a small group of students and just see what happens.”

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Then just out of high school, Garry Clark stepped into Nebraska sight unseen from Washington D.C., a city kid headed to small-town Blair for a scholarship and track team opportunity at now-shuttered Dana College.
A TEDxOmaha talk he gave years later shined light on how those college years and family roots prepared him to face other new frontiers — economic developer jobs in Nebraska cattle country and in Florida, Maryland, Oklahoma and more. Clark called that 2019 talk, “Running Shoes, Food Stamps and Cornfields.”
He also wrote a book: “Unlikely Viking: From the D.C. Projects to rural Nebraska,” which published after he gained local notoriety as a Fremont official who helped the Dodge County community ease a workforce housing crunch fueled by a new Costco chicken processing operation.

Now age 44 and after resigning this year from a Tulsa job he had held for less than a year, Clark has returned to the city where he earned a master’s degree and interned for a housing agency. 
Once again, his new task is somewhat uncharted. He’s the inaugural executive director of Omaha’s Inland Port Authority, a relatively new entity overseeing what many tout as the largest public investment in job and business creation in North Omaha’s modern history. 
Clark told the Nebraska Examiner he expects a “re-emergence” of the roughly 3,000 acres under the port authority’s watch, an area in Nebraska’s most populous city he described as “stopped in time” while communities around it flourished.
Said Clark: “To be a part of a significant change that will probably override systemic issues, historical displacement issues and isolation — this is an economic developer’s dream.” 
Clark gets rolling
Clark made first key appearances in early August, presiding over his initial port authority board meeting and attending a forum in which community members provided input on what they would want an innovation hub to look and feel like within the boundaries.
An innovation hub is just one of the elements expected to rise at the site. A 2021 Nebraska law allowed creation of five inland port authorities across the state, empowering them with tools such as the ability to sell revenue bonds to finance projects and to enter into contracts to spur economic development.

Legislative tweaks in 2024 gave the Omaha port authority more muscle and funding sources. Pushing the changes were a pair of lawmakers, State Sens. Terrell McKinney and Justin Wayne of North Omaha, who had been critical of a real estate development team’s $90 million state-funded plan for a North Omaha business park the two had advocated for near Eppley Airfield. 
Wayne and McKinney had successfully carved out funding for the historically disadvantaged districts and thought there should be more community input in shaping the business park and other pandemic-related resources headed to their represented areas. They called the funds a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity that they wanted to get right. 
One legislative change, for example, required the business park developer to win a letter of support from the Omaha port authority’s nine-member board before it could tap the public funds. McKinney now chairs the port authority board.

The change shifted oversight of the business park contract from the Nebraska Department of Economic Development to the port authority board. And it put $30 million in state seed money for an “innovation district” under the guidance of the port authority. The legislation also called for construction of at least 150 new apartments and 20 houses within the boundaries. 
To help carry out operations, Wayne and McKinney helped secure additional dollars for Omaha’s port authority program by directing interest from state funding pots such as the Perkins County Canal and new prison projects. The board expects to soon receive an $11 million installment as a result.
Additionally, a new $45 million tournament-style youth sports facility is rising in the area, also paid by state and federal dollars related to COVID-19 grants. While that complex along the north shore of Carter Lake will be operated and maintained by the City of Omaha, it will enhance and bring tourism to the port authority area. 
‘Awkward’ start for business park 
Many details still are undetermined for the business park — the anchor of the port authority site. But a leader of the group that DED awarded the $90 million state contract to in January 2024 said Omahans could see land preparation as early as next spring or summer.

George Achola of Burlington Capital described the process so far as an “awkward” dance: partners trying to figure out rhythm and next steps. In addition to Burlington, the development team includes the Omaha Economic Development Corp. and Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce.
“We stumbled a few times. There were disagreements,” Achola said. ”I think Garry (Clark) coming in and helping to choreograph will be beneficial.”
Achola said he thinks partners are all now moving in the same direction. 
Much of the uproar erupted after plans for the business park were revealed in late 2023 — and area residents learned via a news report that their homes were in the way of likely development.
Since then, officials have taken the potential use of eminent domain off the table and assured residents there would be no forced acquisition of property. 
Some lawmakers, including Wayne, were critical that the developer’s plan did not direct money toward building actual structures. The development team, pushing back, said legislators were well aware of substantial costs to prepare the area for shovel-ready lots. Its focus, it said, was always on property acquisition, cleanup, new roads and utility installation and recruitment of industrial-type employers that then would build there.











It’s been very murky for almost two years.


– Garry Clark, Inland Port Authority executive director, says of a planned North Omaha industrial business park



Today, Achola said, developer representatives are “knee-deep” into discussions with property owners over potential purchases in what has been described as the top choice site for the park: a 160-acre site west of the airport and north of Carter Lake.
He and Clark said the team has not ruled out a second priority: a chunk of 67 acres bounded by Locust Street on the south and 16th Street on the west. Development of that former dump site has been hindered by environmental cleanup costs.
Proposed business park near Nebraska’s largest airport embroiled in conflict

Yet another related law passed this year opened more possibilities. The McKinney-led effort expanded where the business park can be located, as long as it remains within port authority boundaries. Originally restricted to within two miles of a major airport, the project now can be as far west as 30th Street and Ames Avenue.
Clark said it has become increasingly evident that the business park might be developed in clusters, in multiple locations — not necessarily on one large segment of land — depending on the land the Burlington-OEDC development team can amass.
The goal is to have a site or sites pinpointed later this year. He said the path is becoming clearer. 
“It’s been very murky for almost two years,” Clark said.
Tech hub, ‘creative’ housing
Clark’s handprint will be more apparent on the future innovation district and 170 new housing units, since his hiring came while planning for those key components was in the early stages.
At the August “visioning” forum, the latest organized by a consulting team led by HR&A Advisors Inc., Clark listened to a room full of area residents discuss the innovation piece intended to lure another slice of talent and jobs to the community: techies and entrepreneurs.

Questions posed during the meeting: Does the community prefer an “anchor-plus, mixed use” model where a major institution or industry is the focus? Or does it want a “reimagined urban” approach that’s more dispersed geographically and revives existing landmarks and properties? The group leaned toward a hybrid, which Clark describes as a hub and spoke option.
He envisions the rise of an innovation district something like north downtown Omaha’s Millwork Commons, a neighborhood anchored by the revitalized historic Ashton business-centric warehouse and surrounded by other new or restored places where creatives live, work and play.
By November, the consulting team, under its $546,000 contract, is to have a detailed plan for the venture that’s kickstarted by the $30 million state grant. Clark said the board then will seek bids for a master developer he hopes will steer both the tech hub and housing construction.
He foresees “creative nontraditional” housing that could take the form of modular, 3-D, or cross laminated timber structures. He would like to see “emerging” Omaha area builders involved in that phase.
Some at the community forum suggested modular home assembly might even be an industry focus of the district.
While port authority legislation calls for at least 150 new apartments and 20 single family homes, board member Davielle Phillips, an architectural designer, said he will push for plenty more.
“There are a lot of vacant lots within the district,” he said. 
What’s in the long run
An upcoming mid-September board retreat in Kansas City, which includes visiting with the local port authority board there and touring its projects, will explore longer term questions, including how ownership and operation of local port authority pieces play out.

Clark is tasked with developing a strategic action plan. He’ll draw upon two decades of experiences in roles such as CEO of the Economic Alliance Snohomish County in Washington state and as economic development director for Nebraska’s Cuming County. He served three years, through the start of 2021, as CEO of the Greater Fremont Development Council.
While heading Fremont’s development efforts in 2018, Clark and other city leaders launched the “Here We Grow” campaign focusing on local workforce and housing expansion. In 2019, the $450 million facility to process Costco chickens opened, creating more than 1,000 jobs. The next year, the State of Nebraska recognized the city, now with a population of about 28,000, for ongoing success in business recruitment and updated housing.
Clark said a benefit to having port authority designation is ownership and land-leasing powers that can build up revenue to maximize development opportunities and help support the district over the long run. Developers likely would own pockets within the district, too, he said.
McKinney said he has grown more comfortable with the direction of the port authority, noting that “confusion” related to the business park marred its launch. He said he feels confident with Clark at the helm.
“The port authority has an opportunity to have a huge impact on the future of North Omaha,” he said of the area that’s long struggled with disproportionately low household income and higher rates of joblessness.

Achola described programming to take place in port authority boundaries as the largest publicly funded, multidimensional undertaking he can recall in the area. 
Clark, now with a wife and three children, said his goal was to return to Omaha. He hopes to augment the port authority budget and offerings by tapping into federal and other resources he’s learned about along his work journey.
“This is excitement for me,” said Clark. “Livelihoods can change because people will have economic opportunities in a neighborhood they can walk out in and feel safe.”

(Alander Rocha/Georgia Recorder)This story originally appeared on Georgia Recorder. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is in turmoil following the ouster of the agency’s director, a series of high-profile resignations, and an attack on its headquarters that killed a police officer, said former CDC staff Tuesday.
The former employees, including ex-deputy director for program and science and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Deb Houry and former director of the National Center for Emerging Zoonotic and Infectious Diseases Dr. Dan Jernigan — who both resigned Thursday — described the current environment at the CDC as a “death” where science is currently being sidelined by political ideology. Houry and Jernigan joined Georgia House and Senate Democrats at the State Capitol Tuesday to discuss the current climate at the CDC.
“You can almost see this as death by a thousand cuts: we’re cutting staff, we’re cutting resources, we’re undercutting science,” said Jernigan.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Jernigan said during a roundtable discussion before talking to the press that there has been an overall lack of transparency between the Trump administration and the CDC, saying that he has seen a shift in the CDC’s operations. Whereas past administrations, regardless of their political leanings, worked with scientists to let data guide policy, Jernigan said the current approach appears to start with a predetermined ideology and then attempts to find scientific justification to support it.
“I recognize you really can’t get politics completely out of public health. [Public health is] really a priority here. What are you putting first? And we’re asking that science go first before the policy development, and not starting with an ideology and then backing into the science,” Jernigan said.
The former CDC employees also tied the current political climate to the recent shooting at the CDC campus, which they said was fueled by years of misinformation about vaccines. Abby Tighe, who was fired from the CDC in May and is a founding member of Fired But Fighting, a coalition of terminated CDC employees and allies, said it’s “tragic to not have a stronger condemnation of this act of violence” and warned that without officials speaking out against the attack, she fears attacks on the scientific community could continue to happen.
“That could look like more attacks, and with the vaccine misinformation being the driver for this, who’s to say that this won’t lead to attacks at pediatricians’ offices or pharmacies or all of these places where vaccines are given and professionals who work in the vaccine space exist,” Tighe said.
CDC employees on Thursday were told they have to return to the office by Sept. 15, according to an email obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, just over a month after nearly 200 rounds of ammunition hit six separate CDC buildings. The building is still being repaired, but Lynda Chapman, chief operating officer who sent the notice, stated in the letter that an “alternative on-campus space” will be provided to those whose office “remains impacted.”
Houry said she left the agency because she “could no longer fight on the inside.” She expressed deep concern over decisions that she said were not being made based on data and science, as well as the loss of talented staff. She said that while she was tasked with sunsetting certain programs during her time, she did her best to archive data so that it could be “resuscitate[d]” if funding is restored.
“If there’s a surveillance system that doesn’t have funding or people, we cannot produce that data. But as we were facing sunsetting a lot of those programs, [we] did what we could to preserve it because we are hopeful that at some point we’ll be able to rebuild our agency,” Houry said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Saira-Draper-and-crowd-for-Sept-3-2025-story-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-09-03 13:58:25.732716

In a Tuesday decision a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration’s deployment of Marines and National Guard units to Southern California, where they assisted with immigration and other arrests, was illegal.
In May, Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, told Fox News that the administration was “looking to set a goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests for ICE every day and President Trump is going to keep pushing to get that number up higher.”
ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced it would give more financial incentives to state and local police to cooperate with ICE, including reimbursement for salary and benefits for officers trained in the 287(g) program to assist ICE in making arrests, and “performance awards” for “successful location of illegal aliens.”
“By joining forces with ICE, you’re not just gaining access to these unprecedented reimbursement opportunities — you’re becoming part of a national effort to ensure the safety of every American family,” ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan said in a statement.

As of Aug. 29, U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement arrests averaged 1,055 a day for the month, down 14% from 1,124 a day in July, according to data obtained by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. The organization tracks federal immigration data.
“President Trump’s orders recently assigning substantial personnel from the national guard and the U.S. military to target Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. may have been counter-productive in failing to increase total arrests countrywide,” said Susan B. Long, co-founder of TRAC and a professor in the Whitman School of Management, in an e-mail statement.
ICE has a new courthouse tactic: Get immigrants’ cases tossed, then arrest them outside

In a Tuesday decision a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration’s deployment of Marines and National Guard units to Southern California, where they assisted with immigration and other arrests, was illegal.
In May, Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, told Fox News that the administration was “looking to set a goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests for ICE every day and President Trump is going to keep pushing to get that number up higher.”
ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced it would give more financial incentives to state and local police to cooperate with ICE, including reimbursement for salary and benefits for officers trained in the 287(g) program to assist ICE in making arrests, and “performance awards” for “successful location of illegal aliens.”
“By joining forces with ICE, you’re not just gaining access to these unprecedented reimbursement opportunities — you’re becoming part of a national effort to ensure the safety of every American family,” ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan said in a statement.

Sept. 3, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceSeveral thousand construction workers, unions members and business leaders gathered Wednesday at the state Capitol building with a message for lawmakers as delayed budget negotiations continue: Do your jobs and find a sustainable solution to Michigan’s looming road funding cliff.
Michigan roads face dire consequences if a legislative roads funding plan isn’t a part of the coming fiscal year budget. Many of the road projects that were funded by bonds during the tenure of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are coming to a close with no clear plan to continue construction after that funding lapses.
On Wednesday, thousands of workers raised their voices to hopefully shake Lansing loose from its current gridlock.
“Michigan cannot afford any more delays in enacting a long-term road funding plan,” said Rob Coppersmith, executive vice president of the Michigan Infrastructure and Transportation Association. “If lawmakers fail to act now, thousands of construction workers will lose their livelihoods and Michigan families will pay the price every time they drive on our crumbling and deteriorating roads. The time for debate has passed, and Michiganders are demanding a solution now.”

The Michigan Department of Transportation has been sounding the alarm bell on what the state’s roads and bridges might look like without a new sustainable funding model. 
In a review of critical unfunded infrastructure needs across the state, MDOT said more than 100 state trunkline bridges are at risk of closure by 2035 if lawmakers don’t act soon to fund road repairs and rebuilds. The department also said last month that the potential for bridge closures statewide would have a daily impact on more than 1.8 million drivers and the roadways they serve.
There’s also talk of job losses by the thousands due to the potential stoppage in road construction as the budget fight continues on.
Although Whitmer and the Republican-controlled state House of Representatives have both put forward plans to fund roads in the next budget, with the latter plan amounting to $3.4 billion, the Democratic-led Michigan Senate has yet to put up a plan of its own.
The House initially refused to pass a full budget, and only moved its plan to fund K-12 and higher education. But the chamber finally passed a full government budget last week, placing the ball in the Senate’s court to move on road funding so negotiations can begin in earnest.
Meanwhile, the budget clock ticks downward with just weeks to go before a potential government shutdown begins Oct. 1.
At the rally, Arlandar Washington, business manager with LiUNA Local 355, said the consequences went beyond busted tires and bumpy rides of poorly maintained bridges, it meant the loss of labor careers for hardworking families.
“When we invest in infrastructure, we’re not just building roads and bridges, we’re building careers,” Washington said. “Every time we fund a road project, we’re putting real people to work. … Jobs you can raise a family on. The best part is, these are jobs that can’t be outsourced. You can’t ship a broken road to another country. These jobs belong right here in Michigan.”

Washington also asked lawmakers to “turn off the scoreboard,” and to take a step in the right direction or face consequences at the ballot box next year.
“Being in lockstep is not getting this done,” Washington said. “We need Lansing to stop finger pointing and to start the road paving and building and bridge building. … Today, we rally. Tomorrow, we will organize. And come Election Day, we will remember.”
Lansing Mayor Andy Schor said cities like his need help from state government to fund dire road repairs.
“I don’t want to hear from folks about busted axles. I don’t want to hear about freeze-thaw and breaking up the potholes,” Schor said. “I’ll fix your pothole in 48 hours, but that doesn’t fix the roads.”
Jim Holcomb, CEO and president of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, said new road funding was vitally important for businesses around Michigan, whether they be small mom and pop shops to global competitors.
“[We are] united by one fact, Michigan cannot grow but on well constructed, and properly maintained, reliable roads,” Holcomb said. “My members sent me here today with a simple message – properly funding our roads is essential to supporting our economy, supporting job creation and ensuring Michigan is well positioned to be a great state.”

Holcomb said that as roads continue to crumble, Michigan’s ability to attract new talent and investments from outside companies would whither, all while driving up supply costs on businesses already here.
“Make no mistake, we are at a crossroads,” Holcomb said. “The time for action is now. Every day, month or year that passes without action is making the problem worse because it leads to higher construction costs in the future.”
Some of the budget fight has hinged on whether the Democrats in the Senate will ultimately agree to cutting large sums from schools or other priorities to fund roads. Holcomb on Wednesday urged lawmakers to look at every single expenditure in state government and prioritize spending on roads.
“This isn’t a Republican or Democratic issue; it’s not a labor or a management issue,” Holcomb said. “It’s a Michigan issue and it must be solved in a way that makes Michigan economically competitive.”

At least two Democratic lawmakers were in attendance at the rally: state Rep. Joey Andrews of St. Joseph and state Rep. Alabas Farhat of Dearborn.
Republican state Rep. Jay DeBoyer of Clay was leaving the Capitol just as the rally was set to begin. He told Michigan Advance that the image of thousands of construction workers crying out for legislative action sent a clear message.
“This is about what the core principles of government are, and it’s fixing and funding infrastructure,” DeBoyer said. “Obviously, it’s also about public safety and education, as well, but this right here is a great demonstration of how the people of Michigan feel, and I couldn’t agree more. We’ve got to get it done.”

(Stock photo by John Carleton/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — A South Carolina law guaranteeing paid parental leave for public school employees extends to mothers of stillborn babies, the state attorney general’s office said Wednesday.
Rep. Neal Collins, who sponsored the 2023 law granting teachers at least six weeks of paid leave after giving birth, asked the attorney general for an opinion last month after hearing some districts denied leave to teachers whose children were stillborn.

collinsn-os-11056-final-opinion-9-3-2025 
Collins said he knew of three such cases, though he declined to name which districts denied leave. Two later reversed course and granted the teachers leave, but one required the woman to draw from her vacation time instead, said the Easley Republican.
Legislators clearly intended for the law to include stillbirths, Solicitor General Emeritus Bob Cook wrote in the opinion. While not legally binding, opinions from the attorney general’s office are a prediction of how a court would interpret a law.
“The Legislature did not specify that the requirement for leave must be a ‘live birth,’” Cook wrote. “Nor did the Legislature indicate that a ‘newborn child’ must be born alive.”
Stillbirths are extremely traumatic, often physically and psychologically, for the parents, Cook wrote. Mothers may still experience medical complications if their child is stillborn, and the parents must grapple with the loss of their child, he wrote.
That was the case for some of the mothers denied leave, who experienced complications including side effects from epidurals that made them unable to walk or drive, Collins wrote in his Aug. 4 request.
When a child doesn’t survive birth, the trauma parents experience is often “vastly underappreciated and understated,” Cook wrote.
“Plainly, stillbirth is the death of your child,” reads a University of Nevada study that Cook quoted. “Whether the child — who has a name, who ‘is real and will always be remembered as a part of the family’ took a breath outside of womb is irrelevant to the extent of the parents’ loss.”
Legally, including stillbirths is the most logical way of interpreting the law, Cook wrote.
The state’s courts and Legislature have previously said they view a fetus, regardless of viability, as a child. That was made especially clear by the state Supreme Court’s multiple decisions upholding the state’s 2023 law that bans abortions after an ultrasound detects cardiac activity, Cook wrote.
Following that line, a stillborn child would legally qualify as a child, Cook wrote.
“In short, it would defy logic for the Legislature to have included within paid parental leave live births — even if living for a short period of time — yet have excluded stillborn births,” Cook wrote.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, which requires schools and other employers to offer 12 weeks of unpaid parental leave, covers stillbirths as well as live births, Cook noted.
Several SC school districts have denied parental leave for stillbirths: ‘It’s infuriating’

Cook urged the Legislature to clarify the law and make sure no more parents are denied leave because their child is stillborn.
“This clarification is especially important to ensure that parents who endure the heartbreak of stillbirth are not forced to fight for benefits they were already promised,” Cook said in a statement.
Collins said he plans to introduce a bill to do that when legislators return in January.
In a text to the SC Daily Gazette, Collins said he agreed with the opinion. Having the backing of the attorney general’s office will hopefully clear up confusion for districts that didn’t understand the law and prevent them from denying leave, he said.
“This will help protect mothers,” Collins said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-97684140-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-03 12:58:15.134799

(Getty Images)The Indiana Citizen filed suit Tuesday against Indiana’s secretary of state and attorney general, seeking a list of more than 585,000 registered Hoosier voters sent to the federal government to verify citizenship status. The offices have refused to provide it.
The Citizen is a nonprofit news outlet operated by the Indiana Citizen Education Foundation, Inc.
Reporter Marilyn Odendahl requested the list in October 2024, after Secretary of State Diego Morales and Attorney General Todd Rokita issued news releases about the request.
The letter, addressed to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ur Jaddou, asked the agency to use its “Person Centric Query Service” to verify a list of names and dates of birth. The list of 585,774 includes those who registered without an Indiana driver’s license number or a social security number — or who live overseas.
Indiana has 4,8 million residents registered to vote, so the letter invited scrutiny of about 12% on the rolls.
According to the lawsuit, Rokita’s office denied the records request in December last year on behalf of both offices. Odendahl then filed a complaint with then-Indiana Public Access Counselor Luke Britt, who ruled in February that the “denial was improper based on the law as plainly written.”
In March, the statewide officeholders sent a letter disagreeing with the ruling, but offered to allow the Citizen “limited public access” consisting of in-person inspection and the ability to make only “a handwritten transcription” of the records.
The Citizen objected to the rules but tried to schedule a time to review the list in July. Rokita and Morales asked new Public Access Counselor Jennifer Ruby to reconsider the complaint and withdrew their offer. There has been no further contact between the parties, according to the lawsuit.
The secretary of state’s office told the Citizen it has identified about 1,600 registered voters as potential noncitizens based on information from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and the vendor overseeing the statewide voter registration system. Also, the office said it has utilized the SAVE system to verify the citizenship status of some Hoosiers.
Messages seeking comment from Rokita and Morales were not immediately returned.

Northern Light announced in a letter on August 15 that it would no longer work with the insurance provider after months of failed negotiations on a new contract. 
The dispute arose over costs, with Anthem alleging that Northern Light “wants to drastically increase the prices it charges to its patients and their employers.” Anthem’s parent company Elevance reported nearly $6 billion in profits in 2024.
Northern Light, which operates a network of hospitals and medical centers across the state, said Anthem has delayed provider reimbursements and “imposed a disproportionate administrative burden on our health system, diverting critical resources away from patient care.” This comes, they note, “during a period of considerable financial pressure on rural health systems across the country.”
On August 22, Anthem suggested bringing in a mediator, to which Northern Light agreed, according to an update posted by the insurance provider. 
However, if no contract is secured by October 1, Northern Light will consider patients who use Anthem out of network for physicians and some other services such as dialysis, hospice and urgent care, and effective December 31, that will extend to hospital-based services, according to Northern Light Health’s public statement.
On Tuesday, Democratic and independent members of the Maine Legislature wrote a joint letter to the presidents of both organizations, urging them to reach a new contract through mediation.
Roughly 30,000 Maine people covered by Anthem health insurance plans would lose their
in-network coverage at Northern Light facilities, states the letter co-signed by Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Cumberland) and House Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford). The failure to reach an agreement would have a “significant and immediate negative impact across the state,” they said.
“In many instances, Northern Light is the only health care provider for Maine communities. Lack of an agreement will limit options and put healthcare access at risk,” Fecteau and Daughtry wrote.
“Maine people could be forced to skip trips to the doctor or drive hours across the state for life-saving treatment. They may also find themselves having to pay more out of pocket for services no longer covered by their insurance.”
Patients in rural areas told the Bangor Daily News that they might have to travel farther and switch physicians if a new contract with Anthem is not finalized.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Texan Matt Langston has kept his campaign business running while collecting a six-figure salary as the Department of Education’s chief policy advisor, though he rarely comes into the office.
Langston badged into the department’s office on North Lincoln Boulevard on 27 days in 2023. In 2024, that dwindled to 11 days. And through June of this year, Langston worked in person on just four days, according to data obtained by Oklahoma Watch under the Oklahoma Open Records Act.
That’s just 42 days in the office since Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters hired Langston in January 2023 and issued a directive ending telework for the agency’s employees.
“He is a ghost employee,” former state representative Mark McBride said after reviewing the findings.
Last year, McBride, along with other state lawmakers, asked the attorney general to investigate whether Langston was a ghost employee, which is a person on an organization’s payroll who does not actually perform the duties associated with their position. The attorney general declined to investigate.
Since 2023, Langston’s political consulting firm, Engage Right, worked for two Texas candidates, formed a political committee in Florida and sent campaign emails on Walters’ behalf.
Langston managed Walters’ 2022 campaign for state superintendent and joined the agency when Walters took office. That campaign is still active, though Walters hasn’t announced plans to run for any state office in 2026.
Walters’ campaign has made only one payment to Engage Right since the 2022 election. It was for $5,000 on March 4, 2024.
In January, Langston created a new political committee called MAGA Florida, according to records from the Florida Division of Elections. The committee reported two donations: $2,000 from Florida Council for Safe Communities, a nonprofit organization that advocates for safe families and communities; and $15,000 from One on One Communications, a company registered to Brett Doster, founder of Front Line Strategies, a political consulting firm where Langston and Matt Mohler, Walters’ chief of staff, have both worked.
MAGA Florida sent mailers in February to promote two Republican legislative candidates. The mailers resembled voter guides and bore the logo of the state Republican Party, which drew a cease-and-desist letter from the party, according to Florida Politics.
Walters’ Staff Also Working from Arkansas, Colorado and Michigan
Oklahoma Watch identified three other agency employees who live out of state; each reported working fewer than 40 hours per week. Two of them, like Langston, have little educational work experience but have stout political consulting resumes.
Typically, part-time, out-of-state workers are hired as vendors through the competitive bidding process, as Mary Vought was. The Department of Education hired Vought’s D.C. area firm, Vought Strategies, last year to write op-eds and book Walters on national TV and radio shows at a cost of $5,000 per month.
Now, the agency employs, rather than contracts with, advisors in Colorado and Arkansas and a consultant in Michigan.
Lexi Swearingen, senior advisor for communications under Langston, lives in Colorado, and Chad Gallagher, whose title is senior advisor, works from Arkansas, according to internal agency documents obtained by Oklahoma Watch.
Swearingen co-owns a gun range with her husband, a county commissioner in Pueblo, Colo., according to news reports and her LinkedIn profile. Previously, she worked as a producer for CNN and Fox News, as well as the presidential campaigns of Rick Perry and Carly Fiorina and the 2016 Republican National Convention, according to a story in Shoutout Colorado.
She collected $16,900 from May to July, Department of Education payroll records show.
Gallagher is a consultant specializing in high-profile brand management and a longtime advisor to former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Gallagher collected about $24,600 from March to July as a Department of Education employee, according to state payroll records.
Another out-of-state employee, Jordan Adams, is an academic standards consultant whose home office is in Michigan. Adams graduated from and worked as an instructional coach for Hillsdale College, the conservative, Christian liberal arts school. Adams has been paid nearly $122,500 since July 2024.
Gov. Kevin Stitt’s return to work order doesn’t apply to part-time employees and has limited exceptions for full-time employees. But Langston is full-time and is paid an annual salary of $150,000.
Langston did not respond to requests for comment. Quinton Hitchcock and Madison Cercy, spokespeople for the department, also failed to respond to repeated requests for comment.
Oklahoma Watch’s previous reporting revealed hefty bonus payments to some agency staff, including Langston, who received an additional $32,000 in January. The department has refused to provide an explanation for the payment.
The Department of Education initially denied Oklahoma Watch’s request for Langston’s key card data and claimed it was exempt under an anti-terrorism provision that allows confidentiality of certain records, such as those related to schematics or security monitoring.
After the Attorney General this summer affirmed that the data is public and subject to disclosure, the department provided the data.
“Anytime an agency is saying, ‘No, you can’t see the records,’ and is constantly dragging their feet to provide public information, it raises suspicions that there’s incompetency, corruption, inefficiency,” said Joey Senat, an Oklahoma State University professor and expert on Oklahoma’s open records and open meeting laws. “Closed government is always where those thrive.”

Prince built his own brand while earning his dietician’s license. Shavonna made her childhood dreams of the ocean come true with three research trips to Antarctica. And Jared credits his grandfather with teaching him everything he knows.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Back to School: L[...]","No matter where you are in life, September may often feel like back-to-school season. Today we share words from some students we’ve spotlighted, as they reflect upon the opportunities made available for Vermonters through learning and education. In their own words: 
“My goal is to become the type of teacher I would have wanted to have.” 
Hannah Jenkins (she/them) realized teaching would offer her a sustainable way to continue to pursue music–and that path required a college degree. Focused on her future as an educator (and now pursuing visual arts rather than music), she’s on track to graduate in spring 2026 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts and a bachelor’s in K-12 art education from Vermont State University’s Johnson campus. 
Hannah is part of the TRIO program, which provides tutoring and advisory help for modest-income or first-generation students who may need additional support in college. TRIO connected Hannah with services for learning challenges and helped her identify VSAC scholarships and loans that are helping them save tens of thousands of dollars. It’s allowing Hannah to pursue a career that’s right in tune with her personal mission: helping others. 
My goal is to become the type of teacher I would have wanted to have. Because I’ve struggled with undiagnosed disabilities, I understand how students can struggle academically and how much that can harm their confidence. I want to be a teacher who’s willing to listen to those students and adapt their teaching style to help them be successful. It takes time and patience, but it’s so important.
“Living healthy provides the energy to reach your personal goal, whatever that may be.”
For Prince Awhaitey, health is a family business. His mom owns her own African grocery store in Burlington, where he moved with his parents and younger sister right before he started high school. Inspired by his mom’s desire to help people with healthy food, Prince’s initial aspiration in college was to be a nurse or physician’s assistant. After his first nutrition class at Virginia State University, he knew he’d found his passion and switched majors to graduate with a bachelor’s in dietetics. 
He earned a master’s degree in special education from Virginia State and a master’s in nutrition and food science from the University of Vermont. When he decided he wanted to earn his dietician’s license, he turned to VSAC. Prince first became familiar with VSAC in high school, as a source of college loans, and then found that VSAC could offer financial support for a non-degree program too. He now has a year left in his course of study, which is an online dietetics certification program offered through the University of North Florida.
Prince’s interest in health is also reflected in his business, The Coco Bar, which helps support corporate wellness programs that inspire employees to optimize their nutrition and physical activity. The Coco Bar sells customized coconuts, which Prince laser-engraves with corporate logos, for organizations to give away as promotional items. 
“It’s a sustainable giveaway that promotes health. It’s more exotic than a stress ball or a keychain, and it doesn’t end up in the landfill. You can drink the water, you can eat the coconut meat or use it in cooking, and you can make the husk into a candle or keep it as a souvenir. People love it,” he says.
Prince is motivated by his interest in teaching people about the benefits of healthy eating and sees tremendous opportunities for people in Vermont. It is that perspective that convinced him to invest in his education. 
“The experience I have has given me the confidence to basically build my own brand.”
“How do I get on that boat?”
Shavonna Bent looked forward to her family’s annual summer visit to the ocean in Falmouth, MA, but she especially loved visiting the Woods Hole Science Aquarium, where her interest in oceanography was kindled. She got her undergraduate degree in Biology from the Johnson campus of Vermont State University and her education journey came full circle as she’s just completed her PhD program in Chemical Oceanography at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, where she did indeed get to board the boat of her childhood dreams. 
As part of her doctoral research, Shavonna has traveled three times from Punta Arenas, Chile, to Palmer Station, one of three U.S. research bases on the coast of Antarctica. The four-day boat ride crosses some of the toughest seas in the world. In Antarctica, she and her team studied how climate change is impacting the ecosystem of Antarctica’s Southern Ocean, a region that plays a critical role in removing carbon from the atmosphere.
As she wrote her dissertation this spring, Shavonna reflected on how she got to Antarctica from Randolph, Vermont. As a first-generation college student, she found the college application process overwhelming, so she worked closely with VSAC’s Talent Search program and her VSAC Outreach Counselor, who helped her navigate the admissions process, financial aid, logistics, and more. She had incredible mentors along the way, like her professors and the scientists she conducted research with. Her advice to others?
“You’ve got to be adventurous and bold. Go after what you want.”
“He taught me everything I know.”
Jared Preseau credits his grandfather with a lot – teaching him to hunt and fish, how to hay, and letting Jared look over his shoulder as he worked on the family farm’s equipment. He also wanted Jared to go to college. Jared’s grandfather passed away two years ago, but his legacy and mechanical knowledge live on through his grandson. 
While Jared was initially opposed to taking his grandfather’s advice on formal education, he reflected on his plans and started to think about what a college education could mean for him. Through VSAC’s GEAR UP college and career readiness program, he began to meet with his VSAC Outreach Counselor; his next step was attending a college fair. 
Jared ultimately chose Northern Maine Community College for its diesel and hydraulics program, and its affordable tuition. Jared is starting there now, and he’s already got a jumpstart through hands-on learning. His experiences have given him an approach that will serve him for life:
“If I break something, I’ll just try again and figure out how to do it. That’s the only way you’re going to learn.”

Glenn Younkin for a veto he executed earlier this year that would have helped support staffing efforts at the facilities, which are facing a critical shortage. The Virginia Health Care Association – Virginia Center For Assisted Living notified the state’s Medicaid office this week that 181 members plan to challenge the governor in the Virginia Supreme Court. 
Within this year’s budget bill was a provision the General Assembly passed that would have provided additional state and federal Medicaid reimbursements to nursing homes to help support staff growth efforts. The idea was among several recommendations made by a special bipartisan committee of lawmakers that toured the state last year to explore health care disparity solutions — particularly those in rural areas.
Virginia House clerk rejects three of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s vetoes

As part of the legislative process, governors review all bills that pass the state legislature. From there they can choose to sign, amend or veto them. However, the Clerk of the House of Delegates Paul Nardo rejected three of Youngkin’s vetoes this spring, including the one on the nursing home reimbursements measure, a move the governor chose to ignore. 
Nardo, who is also the Keeper of the Rolls, acted within his purview when he published a letter to Virginia’s Legislative Information System that he would not formally publish the vetoes. He called them unconstitutional under Virginia’s Constitution. 
Nardo explained at the time that Youngkin had broken procedure by attempting to veto the provisions without also vetoing the budget appropriation that contained it. 
It’s the “unconstitutional” argument that is at the core of the pending lawsuit by the nursing homes. The cohort wants the state’s top court to force Youngkin to comply with the law.

In a release VHCA-VCAL president Keith Hare said that the cohort “had hoped it would not come to this.” 
“This legal action is really about patient care for some of our most vulnerable fellow citizens. It is imperative that nursing homes have the resources they need to appropriately staff facilities and provide their residents with the high-quality care they deserve,” he added. 
Political analyst Stephen Farnsworth predicted at the time of the veto back-and-forth this spring that the dispute “could end up in the courts like just about everything else these days.”

[…]","MU Health's University Hospital in Columbia (photo by University of Missouri Health Care).Amy Frank said it took 17 hours on the phone over nearly three weeks, bouncing between her insurer and her local hospital system, to make sure her plan would cover her husband’s post-surgery care.
Many of her calls never got past the hold music. When they did, the hospital told her to call her insurer. The insurer told her to have the hospital fax a form to a special number. The hospital responded that they’d been instructed to send faxes to a different number.
“It was just a big loophole we were caught in, going around and around,” Frank said.
Frank and her husband, Allen, faced that ellipse of frustration because they were among 90,000 central Missouri patients caught in the middle of a contract dispute between University of Missouri, or MU, Health Care, a Columbia, Missouri-based health system, and Anthem, the couple’s health insurance provider. The companies let their contract expire in April after failing to strike a deal to keep the hospital system and its clinics in-network.
A growing number of Americans find themselves in a similar pinch. In New York City, negotiations between UnitedHealthcare and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center missed a June 30 deadline, briefly leaving some patients in limbo until a deal was reached the next day.
In North Carolina, Duke Health recently announced it could leave the Aetna network unless the insurance company agreed to pay more favorable rates to the health system. And the Franks were nearly caught out-of-network previously, when a 2023 contract dispute between Anthem and a primary care group in Jefferson City, Missouri, prompted the couple to switch some providers to MU Health Care.
Indeed, 18% of non-federal hospitals experienced at least one documented case of public brinksmanship with an insurance company from June 2021 to May 2025, according to preliminary findings by Jason Buxbaum, a health policy researcher at the Brown University School of Health. Over the same period, 8% of hospitals ultimately went out-of-network with an insurer, at least for a time.
Industry observers say long-standing trends like hospital consolidation and rising health care costs contribute to the disputes, and Trump administration policies could make them more frequent as hospitals brace for about $1 trillion in cuts to federal health care spending as part of President Donald Trump’s sweeping budget law.
“They’re going to be more hard-nosed at negotiating with the health plans because they’re going to be in a survival mode,” said John Baackes, a retired insurance executive and former board member of America’s Health Insurance Plans, the national trade group representing the health insurance industry.
Anthem, University of Missouri reach agreement on health care coverage

During the three-month stalemate between the insurer and the health system in Missouri, patients with Anthem plans lost in-network coverage with the region’s largest — and, for some specialties, only — medical provider.
Most people were unable to switch insurance midyear and faced the choice of paying higher prices upfront, delaying care, finding new providers, or running a paperwork gauntlet in hopes their medical conditions qualified for a 90-day coverage extension.
The dispute came at a particularly inconvenient time for the Franks. Allen Frank was recovering from complications from falling off the roof while cleaning the siding of the couple’s home in Rich Fountain in October. When it happened, Amy drove him 24 miles to the nearest emergency room. The facility in Jefferson City had recently been taken over by MU Health Care, and Allen was soon transferred 30 miles farther by ground ambulance to the system’s main hospital in Columbia for surgery to insert two metal plates and several screws to repair his collarbone.
Health care consolidation has been booming nationwide for 30 years, with over 2,000 hospital mergers announced since 1998, including 428 from 2018 to 2023. Mergers may lead to some efficiencies and benefits for consumers, but they also reduce market competition and strengthen the hand of hospitals in negotiations with insurers.
“Insurer markets have been consolidated for a long time,” Brown’s Buxbaum said. “What’s changed is how consolidated the hospital markets have become.”
Now if a hospital system drops out of a network, he said, “it’s not just going to be one key hospital. It’s much more likely to be all the key facilities, or many of the critical mass of providers” in an area.
It’s a scary prospect for patients, making the public threat of a rupture a potent tool in negotiations between hospitals and insurers. That typically works in a hospital’s favor, Baackes said, “because the general assumption is the insurance is being greedy and the hospital is doing God’s work.”
In a statement, Buddy Castellano, spokesperson for Anthem’s parent company, Elevance Health, wrote, “We approach negotiations with a focus on fairness, transparency, and respect for everyone impacted. Health plan rate discussions are complex and require thoughtful collaboration to ensure long-term sustainability. Our commitment remains clear: ensuring access to care while keeping coverage affordable for the families, employers, and communities we serve.”
Allen Frank needed follow-up care in the months after his initial surgery, including a second surgery in July.
A federal law dubbed the No Surprises Act, which took effect in 2022, offers protections for some patients whose provider drops out of network due to a contract dispute. People getting treatment for serious conditions can keep their in-network rates for up to 90 days with their current providers, delaying the need to find a new one or face higher rates. So Amy Frank worked the phones to get that continuity of care for her husband.
“Our deductible was already met. If we go out-of-network, we’re going to have to start completely over for the out-of-network deductible,” she said.
Eventually, Anthem agreed to let Allen Frank continue his care with MU Health Care. But when he showed up for an appointment to get an injection in his injured shoulder, he was told the health system didn’t have a record of the approval. He refused to leave without being seen, and, eventually, a nurse was able to get through to Anthem to get a confirmation number and approval for the appointment.
“It’s just very frustrating,” Amy Frank said in early July, before the sides had reached a deal. “I’ve got my own medical issues, and I don’t feel like mine are bad enough to be fighting for a continuity of care.”
In an email, MU Health Care spokesperson Eric Maze wrote: “While our goal was to reach agreement prior to our contract terminating and to avoid disruption in care, we established processes and resources well in advance to facilitate continuity of care and reduce the burden for our patients. We understand and are sorry for the stress and concern being out of network created for many, and we are deeply grateful for the patience and trust placed in us during this time.”
Rising health care costs are fueling contract disputes. Hospital expenses grew 5.1% in 2024, according to a recent brief from the American Hospital Association, outpacing the 2.9% inflation rate. Labor costs are the biggest driver, with advertised nursing salaries rising 26.6% faster than inflation from 2020 to 2024, the brief noted.
Hospitals want to recoup those costs by pressing insurance companies to pay more for services.
Washington University in St. Louis health economist Tim McBride said that dynamic could be further enflamed by the massive tax-and-spending law. The measure makes significant cuts to federal health care spending over the next decade, including a $911 billion drop in Medicaid spending, and is expected to cause 10 million Americans to lose their insurance.
As negotiations between MU Health Care and Anthem broke down, the insurer claimed the hospital was seeking a 39% rate increase over three years, while the hospital said the insurer wouldn’t budge past 1%-2%.
On June 30, three months into the standoff, the Missouri Senate Insurance and Banking Committee called the two sides in for a hearing that broke months of deadlock and prompted new proposals from Anthem.
“Anthem doubled their rate increase offer,” Missouri Senate President Cindy O’Laughlin, a Republican whose district includes parts of central Missouri, wrote in a Facebook post on July 8, encouraging a deal.
“Yes I know that I’m not on the inside nor the CEO of either but from what I’ve been told this seems a reasonable offer.”
The sides announced an agreement one week later that was retroactive to April 1, the day the previous contract expired.
Amy Frank got several texts from friends and family about the agreement. She’d been so vocal about her frustrations, they wanted to make sure she’d seen the news. But her relief was subdued.
“So you put everybody through all of this for nothing?” she said the day after the deal was announced.
She had already sunk hours on the phone to ensure Allen’s July 31 surgery to repair the plates holding his clavicle together would be covered. She was in no rush to call her doctors to reschedule the appointments she’d skipped, figuring their phone lines would be busy. The experience had her wondering if the two sides were trying to get people upset as a bargaining tactic.
“That money that they’re fighting over — is that really worth all of the stress?” she said.
And after going through two disputes in three years, she can’t help but wonder: How long until the next one?

(Mary Ann Chastain / Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A federal judge in Alabama reprimanded a trio of attorneys in July who used artificial intelligence in a court briefing that cited nonexistent case law.
A Utah state appeals court ordered a lawyer to pay $1,000 to a state legal aid foundation in May after his law clerk improperly used AI to draft a brief. The lawyer failed to check the document before filing it, and it too cited fake cases.
That same month, an Indiana federal judge fined an attorney $6,000 for similar mistakes.
These ever-growing instances of bad AI have prompted action from some state judiciaries, including South Carolina.
The Palmetto State, earlier this year, became among the latest state judiciaries to take a stance on the emerging technology, according to a Duke University law school database.
Chief Justice John Kittredge issued an interim policy “due to the increasing use of artificial intelligence systems in legal research,” he told the SC Daily Gazette in a statement Wednesday.
The policy also was recommended by the National Center of State Courts and National Conference of Chief Justices, he said.
South Carolina is one of at least 10 states where judges have issued an order or guidance around the use of so-called “generative” AI tools — such as ChatGPT, capable of creating text, images, audio and video based on a set of prompts — in state court proceedings.

The chief justice, in March, told judges and judicial branch employees they may not use AI without the state Supreme Court or court administration’s express approval.
The judicial branch republicized the policy with a news alert in mid-August as a reminder.
“Generative AI tools are intended to provide assistance and are not a substitute for judicial, legal, or other professional expertise,” Kittredge wrote in what’s dubbed an interim policy. “As such, content from Generative AI may not be used verbatim; be assumed to be truthful, reliable, or accurate; be treated as the sole source of reference; or be solely relied on in making final decisions.”
Kittredge went on to list other potential risks, including “bias, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and unauthorized use of intellectual property.” He also cited privacy concerns.
There’s no timeline for an update. The policy will stay in place until Kittredge or the entire Supreme Court issues a new order.
Kittredge told the Daily Gazette the language “is intended to be a common-sense approach that recognizes the potential benefits of AI in assisting South Carolina Judicial Branch employees in performance of certain tasks.”
Judges and lawyers in the state have access to Westlaw, a platform for legal research, which includes some AI-assisted research capabilities.
“The Interim Policy states that AI is to be used to assist judges and other judicial branch employees only and cannot be relied on to produce a final product,” he said in the statement.
And while the interim policy does not specifically apply to lawyers, the chief justice also cautioned them against relying on the technology.
“The institutions around law, whether it’s judges or lawyers, operate on some certain function of trust,” David Sella-Villa, a University of South Carolina professor of technology and law, told the SC Daily Gazette. “So how much does technology like this impact what people trust about lawyers and judges?”
Judges and state legal associations across the country that have waded into the issue largely have reached similar conclusions, Della-Villa said. Where they differ is in the process for determining what could be considered admissible.
In Connecticut, the state judicial branch drafted a 21-page framework. And in Michigan, the state Supreme Court signed a contract last month with an AI platform built specifically for judges and judicial staff, according to The National Law Review.
“The difference is, these other states lay out a process or some kind of standard for approval,” Sella-Villa said. “South Carolina does not.”
When it comes to lawyers, rules and policies differ even more, Sella-Villa said.
“There’s a whole variety of practices of what judges are willing to tolerate in their courtroom,” he said.
Some courts have gone so far as to limit any AI use by lawyers to platforms developed by the nation’s big legal research companies, such as LexisNexis or Bloomberg.
Others require lawyers to sign statements saying they didn’t use AI to draft any portion of a filing under fear of perjury.
At least one North Carolina judicial circuit took a different approach. Last year, the senior judge for Cabarrus County, which adjoins Charlotte, issued an order recognizing the increased use of AI by lawyers and society in general. The order reminds lawyers they are “ultimately responsible for everything submitted in a case” and requires disclosure before a trial starts on any evidence created by AI.
“It’s not denying the reality that this is part of legal practice for some people,” Sella-Villa said. “But at the same time, they don’t want to put somebody on the spot to make a decision.”
Between 20 and 30 state bar associations have issued varying levels of guidance, from official ethics opinions to semi-formal advice.
South Carolina’s Bar Association has not issued an ethics opinion but published a series of articles in its monthly magazine on the topic.
“We know that there’s a need for clarification, but there’s not yet a consensus on what exactly are the limits beyond just make sure that the stuff you give to the opposing counsel or a judge is real,” Sella-Villa said.
Because AI is a tool that saves lawyers time when used properly, rules of professional conduct also say attorneys must bill their clients fairly.
USC signs $1.5M contract with OpenAI to train students, faculty on responsible use

In teaching his own law students, Sella-Villa pushes first-year students to steer clear of the technology until they’ve learned how to analyze and write legal briefings on their own.
“If they’re not going and doing the work themselves, it’s hard to know that they’re actually learning,” he said. “It’s great that you can give a prompt and give me something that looks like a lawyer’s answer, but can you actually do that?”
Traditionally, law schools have tested students through their writing samples, so a technology that generates writing creates a new set of issues.
Meanwhile, universities, including USC, are striking deals with these AI companies to make more advanced versions of the technology readily available to students.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SCSupremeCourt-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-03 11:56:54.855682

Article Summary

Illinois has spent nearly $7 million to sponsor a Metro East NASCAR race and build a temporary track in Chicago since 2022. The expenditures are part of a broader state tourism campaign.
The state-sponsored Enjoy Illinois 300 outside St. Louis is the NASCAR Cup Series’ second playoff race this season and creates $60 million of regional economic impact.
The Chicago Street Race is not returning in 2026 after generating a $128 million economic impact in 2024.
The fiscal year 2026 state budget includes $7 million of unspent grant funding for NASCAR plus another $5 million of new grants.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

NASCAR will not be returning to Chicago streets next summer as the racing series takes its road act to likely sunnier weather in San Diego following two rain-plagued races out of its three years in Chicago.
But while the innovative race leaves town for at least one year, the state’s fiscal year 2026 budget still contains several millions of dollars for NASCAR. State records obtained by Capitol News Illinois show the state has spent nearly $7 million hosting or sponsoring the sport since 2022.
That includes sponsorship of the Enjoy Illinois 300 scheduled for Sunday at World Wide Technology Raceway in Madison just across the river from St. Louis. The state-sponsored race is the second playoff race on the Cup Series schedule. It’s one of four NASCAR races scheduled to take place in Illinois this year.
Enjoy Illinois, the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity’s tourism marketing campaign, has been the title sponsor of the race since NASCAR returned to the Metro East track in 2022.
“The event generates significant economic impact through attendee spending on hotels, restaurants, retail, and at other local businesses,” DCEO spokesperson Jordan Troy said in an email. “With the race now part of the NASCAR Cup Series playoffs, the national exposure has grown even more in turn amplifying our brand visibility to attract new and returning visitors to explore all that Illinois has to offer.”
The state’s sponsorship of this weekend’s race is not its largest NASCAR line item, however.
By the numbers
Enjoy Illinois’ marketing efforts extend beyond the state, with TV ads and billboards promoting Illinois tourism across the nation and world. The state previously launched a $30 million post-pandemic advertising campaign with actress Jane Lynch proclaiming the state as the “middle of everything.”
Enjoy Illinois has a $44 million marketing budget in FY26.
The department has also directed $15 million over recent years to broaden the types of events Illinois holds, pointing to Rockford becoming the host city of an IRONMAN triathlon and the 2026 American Hockey League all-star game.
The state has spent about $2.2 million since 2022 to sponsor the Metro East NASCAR race, including $795,000 for this year’s race, according to state records obtained through an open records request.
State lawmakers separately allocate funding for grants administered by DCEO from various state funds. That’s how funding was provided for the Chicago Street Race, which was held in Grant Park for three years beginning in 2023. State records show NASCAR received a $2 million grant from DCEO in 2023 to build and tear down the track and another $2.5 million for the 2024 race.
The Chicago Street Race marked the first time NASCAR built a track through city streets, which is a more common form of racing for Formula 1 and IndyCar. Grant performance records show NASCAR used the funding to pay a variety of companies, including union laborers, to build and tear down the track and move equipment to and from Grant Park. The reports show the work was completed on time and met the state’s standards for NASCAR to receive funding.
“While the scope and use of those funds were determined by the legislature and the grantee, the state’s involvement provided a valuable opportunity to integrate the Enjoy Illinois brand throughout the race venue, creating national visibility for our tourism campaign,” Troy said, adding the grant funding helped make the race possible given the size of its footprint in Grant Park.
NASCAR did not receive any state funding for the 2025 race, according to DCEO.
The state’s fiscal year 2026 budget reappropriates $7 million in grant funding that went unspent in a previous fiscal year and gives DCEO authority to grant another $5 million to NASCAR for “operating expenses.” The funds will not be released by the state until NASCAR provides a budget for the grant with details on how the money will be used.
NASCAR will be back to the Metro East area in 2026 and DCEO’s contract with World Wide Technology Raceway shows Enjoy Illinois has the option to extend its sponsorship to next year’s race.
NASCAR will also be returning to Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet next July for the first time since 2019. A DCEO spokesperson said the department was not involved in any conversations about the sport returning to Joliet. Enjoy Illinois was the title sponsor of the NASCAR Truck Series’ 2013 race at Chicagoland Speedway.
Economic impact
DCEO says its marketing efforts are paying off, and the overarching tourism campaign has directly attracted 2 million additional visitors to the state. The department announced last week 113 million people visited Illinois in 2024 and spent a record $48.5 billion – $1.3 billion more than in 2023 with 500,000 more people visiting the state. Chicago saw a 7.7% increase in overnight visitors.
Enjoy Illinois’ contract for the Sept. 7 race in Madison includes several provisions designed to promote tourism in Illinois.
Enjoy Illinois will get three 30-second advertisements during the TV broadcast on the USA Network, a live interview with an Enjoy Illinois executive on the Motor Racing Network radio broadcast and nine promotional mentions on partner radio stations leading up to the race.
The track has also promised Enjoy Illinois at least three media interviews during the week before the race; sponsorship of fan engagement activities; video board commercials, public address announcements and social media ads; Enjoy Illinois signage around the track; and an Illinois tourism page on the track’s website.
“National cable partnerships like this offer high-impact visibility,” Troy said. “Requiring brand mentions and signage ensures that our tourism message reaches millions of potential travelers in a compelling way.”
NASCAR, the track and Enjoy Illinois also work together to promote the race on various platforms, Troy said.
Other parts of the contract give Enjoy Illinois the right to name a person to wave the green flag at the beginning of the race, the grand marshal, guests to participate in pre-race ride-alongs, and have an Office of Tourism official participate in pre-race and winner’s circle ceremonies, including presenting the trophy to the race winner.
The Enjoy Illinois 300 has sold out each year since it returned in 2022 and generated $60 million of economic activity for the Metro East region, according to DECO. Last year, 2.5 million people watched the race on TV.
The Chicago Street Race had a $128 million economic impact in 2024, according to state contracts – up from $109 million in 2023. Cup Series races both years were delayed and shortened by rain. The 2024 race also generated $9.6 million in state and local tax revenue, according to the Chicago Sports Commission. TV viewership peaked at 4.8 million people in 2023.

(Screenshot)Another Democrat is hoping to flip Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District next year. 
Erin Petrey, who grew up in Kentucky and worked in Washington, D.C., announced her bid for the Central Kentucky U.S. House district Wednesday morning. The current seatholder, Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, is seeking election to the U.S. Senate in 2026. 
Petrey was born in Lexington and grew up on a Lawrenceburg farm, according to the bio from her campaign. She graduated from Fayette County Public Schools, earned a bachelor’s degree from The George Washington University and a master’s degree from the Patterson School of Diplomacy at the University of Kentucky.
She taught English in South Korea, according to her  bio, and then worked in Washington, D.C., focusing on “advancing U.S. public diplomacy, building large-scale renewable energy and healthcare infrastructure projects, and building businesses focused on emerging technologies.” She worked on projects to enhance data center sustainability at Amazon Web Services, the release from her campaign says.
In her launch video, Petrey makes an old fashioned cocktail and likens it to a mix of Kentucky issues. 
“Call me old fashioned but governments — they were built to serve the people, and I want to bring that back so let me serve you in Congress,” she said in the video. 
Petrey joins a crowded Democratic primary. Former Kentucky House Democratic caucus chair Cherlynn Stevenson, former Lexington council member David Kloiber and former federal prosecutor Zach Dembo have all launched campaigns.

(Photo: Ray Di Pietro)Promising a “ground zero” fight between establishment and grassroots conservatives, Tennessee Stands leader Gary Humble announced he will run for the Tennessee Senate’s 27th District seat against his nemesis, Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson.
Humble, who will try to overcome the gap after losing to Johnson by 786 votes out of 24,000 cast in 2022, makes no secret about going directly after the incumbent.
The Tennessee Lookout reported in mid-April that Humble, executive director of the ultra-conservative Williamson County-based advocacy group, would run against Johnson again. But he didn’t make his campaign official until Wednesday.
“For 20 years, Jack Johnson has had every chance to fight for us, and when it mattered most, he failed. I’ve spent the last five years holding politicians accountable, and now I’m asking voters to send me to Nashville to do the job that politicians refuse to do,” Humble said in a statement.

Contending he has built Tennessee Stands into a “formidable” power in state politics by exposing government overreach and influencing the legislative decisions, Humble’s campaign said he is running at a “critical juncture” when conservative priorities are stalling and special interests are getting stronger despite Republican supermajorities.
“We’ve watched as out-of-state PAC money floods our elections, drowning out the voices of everyday Tennesseans,” Humble said in the release. “With Republican supermajorities, there is no excuse for our values and conservative priorities to stall. But Jack Johnson and the establishment cave to pressure from lobbyists while ignoring the people.”
With the Republican primary set for Aug. 6, 2026, Humble will have nearly a year to make his pitch. His platform includes:

Enacting term limits and steps to increase transparency.
Defending the principle that all human life deserves “equal protection” from fertilization to natural death. Humble said, because access exists, he would have voted against a bill this year that codified the “right” to in vitro fertilization and birth control.
Protecting constitutional rights, including the Second Amendment.
Strengthening election security by requiring hand-marked paper ballots and party registration. Republicans statewide are arguing over the need to register with a party, which would close primaries.
Supporting a “Make America Healthy Again” agenda by taking harmful chemicals out of the food supply and ending the state’s reliance on federal health agencies.
Preserving Williamson County’s “character” to make sure infrastructure keeps up with growth.

Humble and Johnson have been at odds since the 2022 election. The challenger criticized a move this year to add $8 million to the state budget to reimburse county election commissions for holding primary elections. The decision conflicts with proposals by Elevate 2025, a slate of candidates that took control of the Williamson County Republican Party in March, to hold a Republican caucus in Williamson County. Humble supports the group’s caucus push in which party members would gather to select candidates rather than hold a primary election at the polls.

Johnson has declined to comment about Humble much of this year. In April, he said the primary funding bill he sponsored wasn’t designed to go after Elevate 2025, even though he supported the Williamson County Conservatives group that opposed it in county party elections.
Humble came out unscathed after an 18-month probe when the Registry of Election Finance failed to find illegal coordination between Humble’s 2022 campaign and Tennessee Stands. Registry member Tom Lawless, an appointee of the Senate Republican Caucus, requested the investigation.
In addition to Humble’s campaign, Tennessee Stands sent out a press release about his announcement Wednesday morning.

(South Dakota Searchlight photos by Joshua Haiar and Makenzie Huber; photo illustration by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Something “perplexing” is happening in South Dakota Republican politics, according to Pat Costello.
He has decades of experience in business and government, having worked as an accountant, a restaurateur, a Sioux Falls city councilman and as commissioner of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development from 2011 to 2016.
Throughout his experience, the approach to business by Republican political leaders has been consistent.
“I can’t remember a governor who wasn’t pro-economic development,” he said.
Costello thinks that could change after next year’s election. Two of the three declared Republican candidates for governor are critical of how the state has involved itself in economic development for the past four decades under Republican control. 
One of those candidates is state Speaker of the House Jon Hansen. 
“You’re using tax dollars to bring in companies that compete with current South Dakota businesses,” Hansen said. “You’re using their tax dollars to fund their competition.”
He has pledged to put an end to what he describes as “corporate welfare.” That would be a reversal of Republican policy and philosophy that has guided economic development in South Dakota since the 1980s. 
Mickelson creates the modern GOED
The late former Gov. George Mickelson combined several separate state offices in 1987 to create the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. Gov. Dennis Daugaard made the office a Cabinet-level agency in 2011.
Julie Johnson was the state secretary of labor when Mickelson created the office, and she helped write the legislation putting its initial programs into law. She said South Dakota’s incentives for businesses grew out of necessity in the 1980s. Back then, she said, the state had few tools to compete with other states for jobs and business investments. 
The Mickelson administration used a temporary sales tax increase to create a revolving fund offering low-interest loans to businesses for startup or expansion — the Revolving Economic Development and Initiative (REDI) Fund. Mickelson also used a new, permanent fee on employer-paid unemployment insurance taxes to create a governor-controlled grant program supporting research and economic development, the Future Fund.
Mickelson pitched his ideas to legislators during his 1987 State of the State speech. Referencing the Future Fund, he said South Dakota needed to make “long-term investments.” 
“Too often, politicians are attracted to short-term programs so that by the next election they might be able to point back and look at benefits or look at results,” Mickelson said. “The courageous politicians are people who are willing to look at the long term and make a long-term investment in what we believe is right.” 
He said the money would be used for purposes including libraries, scholarships, vocational education, tourism development and scientific research. Johnson said those kinds of projects were needed.
“Investments in science, research, and tech were seen as ways to build opportunities and keep young people here,” Johnson said. “Without tools like the Future Fund, we didn’t stand a chance.”
Both funds still exist. The REDI Fund awarded a total of $15.9 million in loans for eight projects in 2024, retaining or creating a projected 447 jobs. The Future Fund awarded four grants totaling $28.6 million last year.
The office has created other programs since the 1980s. Last year, the office and its various boards approved $988 million in aid for businesses. Although some of that is direct spending in the form of state-funded grants, much of it consists of loans, sales tax refunds, federal funds, and bonds that leverage the state’s tax-exempt status. 
The office’s 2024 annual report says its efforts helped create 1,085 jobs and spark $916 million in total capital investment projects.
Those numbers haven’t spared the office from criticism. For example, a legislative committee endorsed a bill last winter to abolish the employer fee that supports the Future Fund. It failed 32-38 in the state House of Representatives. The representative who sponsored that bill, Liz May, a Republican from Kyle, told South Dakota Searchlight she plans to reintroduce it. 
Republican lawmakers grill office’s new leader
During a recent meeting of the Legislature’s Government Operations and Audit Committee, the governor’s new commissioner of economic development, Bill Even, introduced himself to lawmakers. Even and his staff were peppered with critical questions from some Republicans on the committee. 
“Are you making dollars available to just as many small business owners as you are to large, outside-of-South Dakota corporations?” asked Rep. Julie Auch, R-Yankton. 
Even said roughly three-quarters of projects involve existing South Dakota businesses, mostly with fewer than 500 employees.
Assistant House Majority Leader Marty Overweg, R-New Holland, said some state assistance is used to prop up “bad deals.” He pointed to a shrimp-farming project that has yet to break ground after receiving a $6.5 million low-interest loan in 2018 from Madison’s regional economic development group. Of that amount, $5.5 million was a state Future Fund grant to the development group, and $1 million came from the development group itself. 
Then-Gov. Daugaard awarded the Future Fund grant to the Lake Area Improvement Corporation in Madison, which loaned the money to Minnesota-based trū Shrimp, Even told the committee. The improvement corporation did not reply to an interview request. 
The company planned to break ground by the end of 2019 and create more than 100 jobs, but construction never started. In May 2023, Michael Ziebell, president and CEO of the company, told South Dakota Public Broadcasting he hoped to break ground in 2024, offering over 60 jobs. The company did not respond to South Dakota Searchlight’s requests for an interview. 
Even acknowledged the project’s long delays and told lawmakers the state is reviewing legal and financial options to recover the grant. 
“My active engagement here is indicative of the fact that both myself and the governor are interested in understanding how you ensure that projects move forward,” Even said.
Overweg was not satisfied.

“It’s not what government ‘can’ do, it’s what government ‘should’ do,” Overweg told South Dakota Searchlight after the meeting. “We are built on a free-market society. When government becomes the driver of economic development, it distorts the market.”
Overweg said he might support incentive programs if they came with stronger accountability. Right now, he said, companies “can get taxpayer money, pay low wages, and their workers still qualify for Medicaid. That’s a double cost to taxpayers.”
Johnson, who helped create some of the programs, thinks the criticism of economic development policy from some Republicans stems from frustrations over a controversial pipeline proposal. Summit Carbon Solutions, of Iowa, wants to capture carbon dioxide from dozens of ethanol plants and transport it via a five-state pipeline, including South Dakota, to a sequestration site in North Dakota. Supporters, including some Republicans, describe the project as economic development, but a coalition of opponents — including a wing of the Republican Party — oppose it because of concerns about the rights of landowners along the route.
Fourteen incumbent Republican legislators lost their primary elections in 2024, partly due to a split in the party over the pipeline. The Legislature and Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden went on to ban carbon pipelines from using a legal avenue called eminent domain to obtain land access from landowners.
“There’s been a philosophical shift, yes,” Johnson said. “But it feels like guilt by association — especially after the backlash against the carbon pipeline project. People learned the wrong lessons from that fight and are now vilifying economic development writ large.”
A 2026 Republican primary issue
Economic development policy is already an issue in the 2026 race for the Republican nomination for governor. So far, the party’s declared candidates are Hansen, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden and U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson. Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden, who’s filling out the term of former Gov. Kristi Noem after she accepted a Trump Cabinet position, has not announced whether he’ll run but is expected to join the race.
Doeden told South Dakota Searchlight he hopes to change the focus of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. He said the state should shift its focus away from job creation, pointing to South Dakota’s 1.9% unemployment rate. He said the office should focus on helping existing businesses thrive, rather than recruiting new ones.
“We should be helping them be more efficient, more profitable — so they can reinvest in their people and communities,” Doeden said.
Doeden would also establish a small business task force and have the Governor’s Office of Economic Development allocate more of its efforts toward in-state entrepreneurs.

“There are two distinct paths,” he said. “Congressman Johnson wants to subsidize billion-dollar companies from out of state. I want to help South Dakotans build better futures for themselves.”
Johnson rejected that claim, saying, “As governor, my top economic development focus will always be homegrown businesses.”
Johnson previously served in the Rounds and Daugaard administrations, and as an elected member of the state Public Utilities Commission. South Dakota Searchlight asked Johnson for his vision for economic development, and his office sent a statement.
“We will grow the economy with new small businesses, new energy production, expanded dairy, and bringing high-tech jobs home to South Dakota. We will keep tax rates low by growing the tax base,” the statement said. “This is growth with a purpose — not growth for its own sake, but growth that creates opportunity for the next generation.”
Without mentioning the carbon pipeline fight specifically, Johnson said during a recent public forum that he is “befuddled” by blanket opposition to economic development, including data centers and other large projects. He said South Dakota leaders need to be “visionary” and bring new industries to the state “or we are saying that our children will have diminished opportunities.” That, Johnson said, is “absolutely unacceptable.”
“It’s un-American and it’s not at all capitalist,” he said.
Hansen responded on social media, writing that South Dakotans like him aren’t “anti-development,” but against “Washington-style giveaways that shovel OUR money into projects that benefit coastal billionaires while our families and businesses foot the bill.”
Hansen said in a statement to Searchlight that his priority is “freedom and the free market. Making sure our kids get a good education. Stewarding the land our grandparents homesteaded. Putting food on the table for our families. NOT cutting sweetheart deals for big politically connected corporations.”
Although Rhoden signed the ban on eminent domain for carbon pipelines, the rest of his approach to economic development has largely been a continuation of past practices. That includes the appointment of Even, whose service in several prior state government positions included a previous stint as commissioner of economic development.
Rhoden hasn’t announced that he’s running, but he does have a campaign website that alludes to economic development and says “he’s committed to keeping the doors of opportunity wide open for everyone, from farmers and ranchers to small-town entrepreneurs and big-city business owners.”
Traditional approach works, defenders say
Nathan Sanderson, a Republican, executive director of the South Dakota Retailers Association and former director of policy and operations in the Daugaard administration, said one of the state’s greatest economic development successes is the dairy industry.
He said because of the state recruiting out-of-state operations and supporting local expansions through loans, bonds, grants and tax relief from 2011 to 2023, South Dakota’s dairy cow population more than doubled from 90,000 to 187,000 as North Dakota’s collapsed from 20,000 to 14,000, according to data from the National Agriculture Statistics Service.
“That is a direct result of government engagement,” Sanderson said. “If the state didn’t get involved, that growth wouldn’t have happened. This isn’t about picking winners and losers — it’s about building partnerships to improve quality of life.”
Costello said incentives are often the only meaningful tool South Dakota can offer to compete nationally. 
“If every state dropped its business incentives, we could, too,” he said. “But they haven’t, and we can’t afford to sit on the sidelines.”
But he also said criticisms of former Gov. Kristi Noem’s use of the Future Fund in recent years were valid.
Examples included her use of the fund for a $2.5 million contract to promote and conduct the Cinch Playoffs Governor’s Cup rodeo in Sioux Falls. Noem played a starring role in the rodeo, carrying the American flag into the arena on horseback and posing for photos with the event winners.
Noem also used $13.5 million to help construct a Rapid City-area shooting range lawmakers declined to fund, and approved a contract for up to $9 million, mostly from the Future Fund, for the Freedom Works Here workforce recruitment campaign starring herself.
Costello said state economic development tools are intended to be used with everyday South Dakotans in mind.
“We’ve always said we work through the business community, but we work for the citizens,” he said. “It’s about encouraging better jobs, higher wages and a better quality of life.”
While acknowledging that not every deal succeeds, Costello said the overall record is positive. South Dakota’s median household income trailed the national average throughout the 1980s and ’90s but caught up and even surpassed it several times since 2008.
“Any economic development strategy will have wins and losses,” Costello said. “The real question is whether we’ve improved life for South Dakotans. The answer is yes.”

Bush, and Irma Carrillo Ramirez, nominated by former President Joe Biden, made up the majority in the case. Judge Andrew Oldham, nominated by Trump, dissented.“A country’s encouraging its residents and citizens to enter this country illegally is not the modern-day equivalent of sending an armed, organized force to occupy, to disrupt, or to otherwise harm the United States,” according to the majority in the175-page opinion. “There is no finding that this mass immigration was an armed, organized force or forces.”The lead attorney on the case, Lee Gelernt of the American Civil Liberties Union, praised the ruling. “This critical decision makes clear that the president cannot invoke whatever powers he wants,” Gelernt said in a statement. “This is a huge victory for the rule of law.”Oldham dissented with the majority, arguing that a president’s authority to make the “declaration of an invasion, insurrection, or incursion is Conclusive. Final.” “And completely beyond the second-guessing powers of unelected federal judges,” Oldham wrote in his dissent.A U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Tuesday’s decision is not final. ""President Trump and Secretary (Kristi) Noem will not allow criminal gangs to terrorize American citizens,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “Unelected judges are undermining the will of the American people. This ruling will not be the final say on this matter. We are confident in our position, and we have the law, the facts, and common sense on our side.""Trump's use of Alien Enemies ActIn March, President Donald Trump applied the Alien Enemies Act to Venezuelan nationals ages 14 and older who were accused of belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang. He used the proclamation to send more than 200 Venezuelan men to a notorious prison in El Salvador, where they remained for months before being released to the Venezuelan government in a prison exchange this summer.Trump also designated the Venezuelan gang as a foreign terrorist group earlier this year. Prior to March, the Alien Enemies Act had been invoked only three times – in the War of 1812, World War I and World War II. The Trump administration applied the law to quickly expel Venezuelan nationals and argued the proclamation allowed for the skirting of due process rights, which judges have rejected. In April the Supreme Court temporarily allowed the Trump administration to use the wartime law but said those subject to the proclamation needed to have adequate notice to challenge their removal. In May, a separate Alien Enemies case was sent to the high court, which instructed the 5th Circuit to determine if the Trump administration's declaration of the wartime law was legal. Tuesday’s decision stemmed from that case.The decision only applies to the use of the Alien Enemies Act. The Trump administration can continue to remove people who are not U.S. citizens deemed as foreign threats.",,,,2025-09-03 11:56:54.855682

(Photo by Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)Dominion Energy is proposing a rate increase for residential customers that will add on an additional $10.51 a month starting in 2027. The State Corporation Commission, which held its first hearing about the possible rate increase on Tuesday, will consider the company’s reasoning for the rate hike and their proposed fuel rate increase that will add an average $10.92 monthly rate for customers.
The utility company that serves over two million Virginia homes is also attempting to create a new rate class just for large power users, such as data centers, a nod to a 2024 recommendation by a Virginia legislative commission. Currently, data centers are under the same class as large manufacturers but the utility wants to add transparency to show that the high load users are paying a fair rate for the amount of energy they demand, and to put financial safeguards in place for the cost of new energy infrastructure for those users.
 Rate increase

The base rate increase proposal is largely due to the higher cost of critical materials needed to generate and deliver power, according to Dominion. From wires to power poles to transformers – the cost to maintain the current grid is getting more expensive on top of power demand continuing to rise. Dominion’s plan would phase in the increases over two years. 
In January 2026, the base rate would increase by $8.51 monthly for the average residential user, and in January 2027 an additional $2 would be added monthly. The company said this is the first time in decades they have increased their base rate. But due to various riders, which are the added costs of infrastructure projects and storm recovery, there have been other increases in bills over the years.
Several public witnesses stated Tuesday during the SCC hearing that they already struggle to pay their utility bills on top of other inflation-driven costs rising. Many shared personal stories of skipping meals or having to work multiple jobs to make ends meet.
 Fuel rate

With the rising cost of fuel and energy capacity, Dominion is asking regulators to increase the fuel rate to $10.92 a month. In July 2025, the SCC approved an interim rate of $8.92 and, if the proposal is approved, an additional $2 will be added to remove the cost of PJM interconnection capacity rates from the base rate. Dominion does not gain a profit from the fuel rate; it is a passthrough cost of business. The cost of natural gas has been increasing nationally, which is why their rates need to go up, the utility said.
 Data centers

Dominion serves about 450 data centers in their Virginia coverage area. Virginia hosts over a third of the world’s data centers, with the majority in Northern Virginia. As the power-hungry centers boost the demand for more energy production infrastructure, environmental groups and some residents are concerned they are not paying their fair share and could leave localities on the hook for building out the infrastructure, if the data center never actually comes to fruition.
Under Dominion’s plan, a new rate class would be created for utility customers that use more than 25 megawatts and use a load factor of more than 75% monthly. This describes most data centers and many of their larger industrial and commercial customers. Attorneys representing grocery stores and the military bases in Virginia, who are also high load customers, pushed back against the proposal Tuesday, stating that it is not fair to force the legacy customers into a new rate class.
A 2024 study by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission found that data centers are accurately being charged for current costs. However, the report stated that data centers are likely to drive up costs for all customers due to the need to build out energy infrastructure that would not otherwise be built.
“Establishing a separate data center customer class, changing cost allocations, and adjusting utility rates more frequently could help insulate non-data center customers from statewide cost increases,” the report stated.
Dominion said it is basing the new rate class proposal off of the JLARC recommendations.
Legislative report: Development of data centers could triple energy demands if unconstrained

A more controversial portion of the new rate case is Dominion’s request that high-use customers  sign a 14-year contract that will ensure they will pay for their proposed energy costs, even if they use less or if the data centers aren’t built. The goal is to ensure that if companies propose the data center and the energy infrastructure — such as gas plants, nuclear power plants, solar or wind — is built, then the company will pay for it no matter what.
The minimum demand charges for these users would be 85% for transmission, 85% for distribution, and 60% for generation. They would be charged more if they exceed those minimums.
“If the high load customers live up to what they request in terms of service, then none of the protective elements, such as minimum charges or capacity reassignment provisions, come into play,” said one of Dominion’s attorneys in the case, Joseph Reid III.
Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, submitted a letter into the record of the case that he is in support of providing a pro-economic environment for data centers in the state but agrees with Dominion’s plan creating fair cost allocation.
A group of some of the data center companies and other retailers in the case have joined together to offer an amended version of Dominion’s plan. It’ll be up to the SCC to determine if they will accept their proposal in pieces or in total.
“Make no mistake, load growth from large customers presents a massive earnings opportunity for Dominion shareholders. The company’s objective is to vigorously protect that opportunity by shifting as much risk as possible from its shareholders onto its high load customers,” said Nikhil Vijaykar, an attorney for the Data Center Coalition in the hearing. “That is why Dominion wants to lock high load customers into 14 year contracts but makes no reciprocal commitments to get power to those customers on a reasonable timeline.”

The key differences in the data centers’ counter plan are that the new rate class would l only apply to new customers who use more than 50MW that would come online starting in Jan. 2026. Their minimum demand obligations would be 75% for transmission, 75% for distribution, 50% for generation for non-shopping customers and 0% for shopping customers. Some of the high load customers want to aggregate accounts for applying for those minimum charges.
The data centers that are already built or have been financially settled before construction would not be implicated in these new rate cases and risk requirements under the proposed amendment. The data centers’ amendment also asks for more wiggle room in reducing their MW load from Dominion without penalty. Their plan proposal also greatly reduces the collateral that Dominion is asking for, from $1.5 million per MW down to $450,000 per MW.
Under Dominion’s plan, exit fees would kick in if a high load user closes its doors before the end of a contract, meaning the companies would have to pay the minimum demand charges for however many years are left in the contract. The data centers’ proposed amendment would lower the minimum demand charges timespan to less than five years.
Environmental groups are broadly in favor of Dominion’s plan to create a new rate class for data centers that would increase transparency and include new risk requirements. But multiple groups represented in the case feel it does not go far enough.
“The truth is that no one in this proceeding or anywhere in the world can say with certainty whether the projected level of energy used by data centers will be sustained for seven years, for 15 years, for 30 years,” said Nathaniel Benforado, an attorney representing Appalachian Voices in the case. “When we’re talking about recovering capital costs for generation, transmission and distribution assets that are being planned for today, this evidence suggests that the current system is not equipped to handle this growth.”
The SCC hearing for the rate case and fuel factor are expected to last through the end of next week. A decision on the case is not expected until December.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)With billions in public infrastructure funding sitting unused, a panel of New Mexico lawmakers has given initial approval to a more controlled way of funding local projects like roadways, water and sewer systems and public schools.
The Legislative Finance Committee’s Capital Outlay Subcommittee recently voted to direct legislative staff to begin drafting legislation to set new limits when a locality fails to spend capital outlay money.
Legislators feel urgency about reforming the capital outlay program, in part, because according to the latest data, at the end of June, a total of $7.2 billion in unspent capital outlay remained across nearly 6,500 active projects. While some projects have made progress, hundreds have not spent any of the funding, the data show.
Specifically, the subcommittees approved a proposal for LFC staff to work with the state Department of Finance and Administration to develop criteria that localities must meet to receive money from the Capital Development Program Fund in 2026 for planning, design or construction of projects that are almost done or have high-quality cost estimates.
New Mexico in 2024 created the fund to establish an alternative approach to capital outlay funding to address challenges local governments have in actually spending the money they receive. By law, the fund can only be used to pay for projects that cost $5 million or less, or for the planning and design phases of projects that exceed that amount.
The subcommittee also voted to direct staff to draft legislation that would require unspent capital outlay funds to revert to the Capital Development Program Fund rather than back to the General Fund, where they would again be available at the discretion of individual lawmakers. The proposal would also only allow localities to ask for one-time extensions per appropriation and set a cap on the value of projects that can be reauthorized.
The subcommittee also voted to direct staff to draft another piece of legislation that would limit discretionary capital outlay that is awarded by individual lawmakers to only be used for local drinking water and sewer projects.
Any draft legislation resulting from the proposal will have to return to the full Legislative Finance Committee for potential endorsement ahead of the 2026 legislative session, Rep. Derrick Lente (D-Sandia Pueblo) told the subcommittee.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-03 15:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"After Hurricane Katrina, moms built new lives by building homes","Jessica Kutz, The 19th",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/03/after-hurricane-katrina-moms-built-new-lives-by-building-homes/,Single moms found a lifeline in construction jobs after Hurricane Katrina to build financial security before the next big storm. What happens if that disappears?,"When Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast on August 29, 2005, it wiped out the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people. But one industry thrived by necessity in the aftermath: demolition, debris removal and construction — the building trades in which men comprise 96 percent of the workforce. By contrast, women, who made up the majority of the tourism and hospitality services that were hit hardest by the storm, saw precipitous drops in employment. 
Gender inequalities were amplified. Before the storm, many women — particularly Black women and single mothers — were trapped in low-wage jobs, and they didn’t have the necessary resources to get back on their feet post-Katrina. And with child care and school systems wiped out across the region, they also struggled to find a place to send their kids while they looked for work. 
Carol Burnett, then-executive director of Moore Community House, a nonprofit in Biloxi, Mississippi, which provided child care to low-income women and single mothers, watched firsthand as this dynamic played out. Her own organization was nearly destroyed in the storm, and she immediately went to work securing funds to rebuild the free child care program, which was funded by Head Start.
Burnett saw a need for better employment opportunities for the single moms who relied on Head Start. In Biloxi alone, thousands of jobs were lost at the casinos and hotels that dot the shore. So when a D.C.-based nonprofit reached out to see whether she would be interested in hosting a job training to help women enter tradeswork, she jumped at the opportunity. After all, it wasn’t that there weren’t jobs, it was that they were all going to men. 
With a small amount of initial funding, she launched the program and found projects in the neighborhood where the women could gain experience in construction and demolitions. Twenty percent of the city had been destroyed by the hurricane, and the houses surrounding Moore Community House were decimated. 

“The hands-on training came from just being there with these teams to help rebuild homes after Katrina.”
— Carol Burnett, former executive director of Moore Community House


“We were involved in a coalition of nonprofits all pulling together to try to rebuild and recover,” Burnett said. “The hands-on training came from just being there with these teams to help rebuild homes after Katrina.” 
In the nearly two decades since, the program has expanded and updated its curriculum to meet the needs of the industry. This year it graduated its 117th class and boasts a 70 percent employment rate for graduates in trades or related jobs. 
“It’s a proven strategy for making a difference in the lives of single moms,” Burnett said.

Despite its success, the program lost a crucial piece of funding this spring when Elon Musk’s so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” abruptly cancelled the two-year Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations (WANTO) grants, which support training women in construction trades. The reason given in letters to grant recipients was that the programs no longer aligned with the Department of Labor’s priorities, particularly as it relates to diversity, equity and inclusion. 
The cancellation has imperiled the future of the program, which has provided a way for low-income women and single mothers — some of the most vulnerable to disasters due to poverty and their roles as caregivers — to achieve financial security.  
Women like Brianna Crusoe. 
In 2018, the single mom was struggling to make ends meet while raising two young children and working at a call center when a cousin told her about the women in construction program. 
At 23, she was exhausted from working in customer service, something she’d done since she was 15. The call center didn’t pay well, wasn’t flexible with its scheduling, and she had to work weekends and nights.
With nothing to lose, she decided to enroll in the pre-apprenticeship program. The program paid for her two children’s child care and provided a weekly stipend, both of which made it possible for her to participate. 
For eight weeks, she learned the ins and outs of the construction trades like workplace safety and how to use basic tools and equipment that might be found on a jobsite. She also learned about the benefits of working in the trades, including a $30 per hour salary — over double what she was making at the call center. 
Bolstered by the experience, she applied for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union apprenticeship, a multiyear training that would pay her while she learned the skills of the trade. To her surprise, she got in.  

“They literally guided me through every single step of the way.”
— Brianna Crusoe

“It blew my mind, because I didn’t believe in myself at the time. But because I had all these credentials through women in construction, I was a high priority candidate on the list,” she said. 
Because Moore Community House offered child care for a full year, she started the apprenticeship without having to worry about what to do with her kids, and she also was given money to buy textbooks, tools and personal protective equipment. The nonprofit also helped her prepare for her apprenticeship interview.

“They literally guided me through every single step of the way,” she said. 
Seven years later, she now works as a test electrician after being the only Black woman in her graduating class. She’s since moved into a two-story home in a neighborhood with better schools for her children. “That has always been my goal, is to put them in a good educational school,” she said. And because she no longer has to work weekends, she can take vacations with her family. 
“It changed my life tremendously,” she said. “I’m happy about going into work. I’m no longer stressed as far as doing my job.”
Branden Forshee, the current executive director of the nonprofit, said even for those women who don’t go on to work in the trades, the training they receive can open doors to better paying jobs. “Just having a forklift license makes a world of difference,” he said. The nonprofit also has partners in the shipbuilding industry, and with some of these basic certifications, women have an opportunity to break into that career, too. 
Moving women into these better paying jobs addresses what’s known as occupational segregation, a term used to describe the disproportionate concentration of women and people of color in low-wage jobs. 

“There was no warning, there was no notice.”
— Branden Forshee, executive director of Moore Community House, on federal funding cuts

“These women are working; they’re just working a job that pays terrible wages and has no benefits and doesn’t have any flexibility,” Burnett said. “If they’ve got a kid, they can’t do anything if there’s a daycare problem because their employer will fire them.”
But what’s allowed women to make the leap is the fact the program offers wrap-around services like child care and a weekly $100 stipend, something made possible after receiving a federal grant in 2017. 
The abrupt cancellation of their grant came “out of nowhere. There was no warning, there was no notice,” Forshee said. The program stopped offering the child care benefit this year and cut the stipend in half. He said it’s made an immediate impact on who is able to take the class. They usually have between 20 to 25 students. There are just five participants in the current cohort. 
“It’s never happened before,” he said. “There’s obviously the disappointment that comes with seeing a class that small and the frustration behind understanding the importance of those supportive services and not being able to provide them,” he said. 
Crusoe said it was devastating to hear the news. 
“Child care is a big necessity for us single mothers, and so them taking away that child care stipend is basically putting single mothers back at a standstill,” she said. 
Moore Community House recently reapplied to the same grant that was cancelled in the hopes that they could once more depend on federal funds to continue offering some of these services. 
Single mothers are disproportionately impacted by disasters, according to researchers. They are more likely to live in poverty, in public housing, and are often taking care of children and the elderly. All of these are factors which make it harder to recover from a natural disaster. Because the majority of disaster relief funding goes to property owners, they also miss out on assistance to rebuild their own lives when housing has been washed away. 
“It’s gendered in a context of what was available pre-storm, and what was available during those three years of really intense recovery,” said Pamela Jenkins, a retired professor of sociology who authored numerous academic papers on post-Katrina recovery. 

“For marginalized women, the storm only made their lives worse.”
— Pamela Jenkins

“For marginalized women, the storm only made their lives worse,” she said. “Remember, most of these people … they worked two or three jobs just to get by. The restaurant jobs, the nursing jobs. All those jobs were gone,” she said. 
But Jenkins, who lives in New Orleans, said women weren’t just victims of the storm, they were also the ones coming up with solutions. She met many women through her research who, like Burnett, were working on the community level to plug the holes in social services that appeared after the storm. 
They spearheaded efforts to bring child care back to the city, expanded homeless shelters for women and families and helped women flee domestic violence. 
Now, 20 years after Hurricane Katrina made landfall, Jenkins fears that a lot of the progress made to address the needs of women after a natural disaster is evaporating under the Trump administration. 
“One, the government is not going to respond the way that it did, even under [George W.] Bush,” she said. “And two, this kind of misogyny that’s being allowed across the country is going to influence how women are affected by the next storm,” she said. 

“This kind of misogyny that’s being allowed across the country is going to influence how women are affected by he next storm”
— Pamela Jenkins

The Federal Emergency Management Agency has lost thousands of employees since Donald Trump returned to office. On Monday, former and current agency staff wrote a letter to Congress titled, “the FEMA Katrina Declaration,” warning that a downsizing of the agency and shifting of responsibility to states could affect the country’s ability to respond to the next major disaster. 
In the case of the women that Moore Community House works with, the grant cancellations mean less economic security before the next disaster hits. 
“If you’re a single mom, stuck in a low wage job. How do you pay for recovery?” Forshee asked. “The work that we do is important because we provide a place for their kids to go while they participate in the training that puts them on a pathway to earning higher wages.” 
“In the context of rebuilding, it helps them start to rebuild their own lives, but also help others in beginning to rebuild theirs.”

Santiago/Getty Images)More police agencies, from big-city departments to federal agencies, are lowering education standards for new recruits — a sign of how much the profession is changing as it struggles to recruit and retain officers.
This year, at least two major city agencies — the New York Police Department and the Dallas Police Department — have cut some education requirements for new recruits.
In February, the NYPD reduced its college credit requirement for police academy entry from 60 credits to 24. Following a new policy approval in June, the Dallas Police Department began allowing applicants with only a high school diploma or GED to qualify if they also have three consecutive years of full-time work experience.
Police agencies nationwide are loosening education requirements in an effort to address years of staffing shortages. The changes also come as President Donald Trump has drawn more attention to crime and public safety by deploying the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, and signaling plans to expand federal enforcement efforts in Chicago and other cities. Trump also has taken over the District of Columbia’s police department. (A federal judge on Tuesday ruled Trump’s mobilization of U.S. Marines and the California National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles this summer violated federal law.)

Reports of violent crime nationwide have been decreasing since 2022. Some communities, though, are still facing higher rates of certain crimes, including homicide.
The changes in New York City and Dallas are part of a yearslong trend of police departments easing college requirements, a shift that includes Boise, Idaho; Chicago; Louisville, Kentucky; New Orleans; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Memphis, Tennessee; and Bellingham, Washington. Even some state police agencies, such as the Kentucky State Police and the Pennsylvania State Police, have followed suit.
But these changes in education requirements aren’t limited to local and state forces. The FBI — which for decades required a four-year degree — will no longer mandate one for new recruits starting in October. New recruits also will receive just eight weeks of training, down from the previous 18-week standard, according to The New York Times.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also has loosened standards as the Trump administration seeks to expand immigration enforcement. The agency removed its five-week Spanish-language training requirement. Translation needs would instead be met through unspecified technology, The Intercept reported.
ICE has paired these changes with aggressive incentives, including signing bonuses of up to $50,000, as much as $60,000 in student loan repayment and retirement benefits.
These changes reflect a broader challenge in policing: Agencies are still struggling to recruit and retain officers amid increased public attention and shifting workforce expectations.
“The demand exceeds the supply, and what’s happened is the environment for being a police officer has changed,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a national nonprofit think tank on policing standards. “The expectations have never been higher.”
Resignations and retirements rose sharply after 2020, when nationwide protests put law enforcement under closer public scrutiny following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. Additionally, some officers are leaving big-city departments for smaller agencies. At the same time, some experts say, police agencies are competing in a tight labor market in which shift jobs may be less appealing than positions with regular hours, higher pay or remote work options.
In recent years, the push for better-educated officers has been rooted in research suggesting that college graduates are less likely to use force and perform better on the job. But some say that strict education mandates can shrink the applicant pool and shouldn’t be the sole measure of what makes a good officer.

“College education, in the greater scheme of things, is advantageous. It’s necessary, but not sufficient,” Wexler said, noting that agencies should also weigh a recruit’s work history, maturity, judgement and other characteristics.
Agencies of all sizes also have adjusted other standards to attract more applicants — raising or lowering minimum age limits, loosening tattoo policies, scaling back fitness tests and waiving exam fees.
In some departments, these changes have sparked a surge in applications, but they haven’t always translated into higher staffing levels overall.
Following the NYPD’s announcement in February that it was changing its education requirement, daily applications jumped from an average of 53 to 231, according to a news release. In early August, the agency swore in 1,093 recruits — its largest incoming class since January 2016.
The New Orleans Police Department nixed its college education requirement in 2015 and saw a surge of 7,440 applications just two years later.
But hiring never kept pace: The department brought on about 100 recruits a year, and far fewer after 2020, according to the city’s hiring dashboard. In 2024, the department received 1,575 applications and hired just 35 recruits.
A report from the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s office released late last year found that between 2019 and 2023, the department lost nearly 27% of its policing staff.
Solving the staffing crisis
Staffing shortfalls have been a long-standing challenge for law enforcement agencies, stretching back well before 2020. But in recent years, hiring has improved in some parts of the country.
The latest Police Executive Research Forum survey, based on responses from 217 agencies across 39 states and the District of Columbia, suggests staffing trends are uneven.
As of Jan. 1, sworn staffing was up slightly from the year before but still 5.2% below 2020 levels, according to the survey. Large departments saw modest growth in 2024 but still employ 6% fewer officers than in 2020, while medium and small agencies have not just recovered but now surpass 2020 levels.
“This period we’re in now, and we have been in for the last few years, is the most challenging time to hire a police officer,” Wexler said.

In recent years, state legislatures also have looked into the education requirements for police. In 2023, for example, Oregon lawmakers considered a bill that would have required at least two years of higher education for departments with fewer than 50 officers and a bachelor’s degree for departments with more than 50. It would have applied to police, corrections, parole, probation and reserve officers, but the bill stalled in a Senate committee.
More recently, lawmakers in California are considering a bill that would, starting in 2031, require incoming officers to obtain a policing certificate, associate degree or bachelor’s degree within 36 months of graduating from a police academy. Incoming officers could also meet the requirement through prior military service or out-of-state law enforcement experience.
The proposal has received widespread support from many law enforcement agencies and groups in the state, including the California Police Chiefs Association, California State Sheriffs’ Association and the Peace Officers Research Association of California.
The sheriffs’ association praised the legislation, writing in a statement that it offers a range of acceptable experiences — “enhancing academic rigor” — without burdensome requirements that could hurt agencies’ recruiting goals.
Police education requirements are often set by individual departments or local jurisdictions, rather than written into state law. Across the country, most local law enforcement agencies require only a high school diploma or GED, though officers with a college degree may have more opportunities for promotions and higher pay.
“Educational standards across law enforcement agencies vary considerably,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University.
Some agencies also have created pathways for new officers to earn college credit through completing the police academy program and offer tuition reimbursement for those who want to pursue advanced degrees.
But La Vigne told Stateline that in-service training, organizational structure, leadership and accountability mechanisms within a department also play a key role in shaping a well-rounded officer.
“Those factors, I think, override anything as simple as ‘We’re requiring or removing education as a threshold for employment,’” La Vigne said. “Educational requirements alone are not the biggest factor.”
What makes a good cop
What makes a good police officer has long been debated, with discussions often centering on the role of education, training and personal qualities.
Some argue that, rather than lowering education requirements, departments should improve people’s perceptions of the police by becoming more involved in the community, especially at a time when heightened scrutiny has made the job less appealing to some.
“It’s trying to fix the problem assuming that the way things work now is the way things are supposed to be,” said Jim Nolan, a sociology professor at West Virginia University and a speaker with the nonprofit Law Enforcement Action Partnership. Nolan previously served as a police officer and as an FBI unit chief. “It’s the approach to policing that’s wrong.”










Having a college education by itself doesn’t mean you will be a better police officer.


– Chuck Wexler, Police Research Executive Forum executive director


Some research suggests that college-educated officers use force less often, face fewer complaints and are disciplined less frequently than their peers without a degree. Some policing experts say a college education may give officers a broader perspective on a range of issues while also strengthening critical thinking and teamwork skills.
Research also suggests that college-educated officers are stronger writers, which can lead to clearer investigations and casework, according to a 2017 report on higher education in policing.
But some experts still caution that the research is not conclusive and argue that education alone isn’t enough to determine what makes a good police officer.
“Having a college education by itself doesn’t mean you will be a better police officer,” said Wexler, of the Police Executive Research Forum.

AmeriCorps officials said in a filing in the U.S. District Court for Maryland, that the $185 million represents the remainder of the funding appropriated by Congress for AmeriCorps in the current fiscal year. AmeriCorps pledged to apportion the funds by Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal 2025.
New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez announced this week that means $2 million in funds will be released to New Mexico.
“The work of this coalition was crucial in safeguarding these critical funds to AmeriCorps—a vital public service program that steps up when our communities need it most,” Torrez said in a statement. “From helping families recover after devastating wildfires and other natural disasters to mentoring youth, supporting special education, preparing teachers, and providing services for at-risk and homeless youth, AmeriCorps volunteers are essential to our communities. This $2 million investment ensures New Mexico programs can continue delivering these services, our office will keep fighting for underserved populations and the resources they deserve.”
According to a news release, the New Mexico funding included money for programs “that support culturally responsible education, after-school and youth mentoring programs, special education services, teacher preparation, environmental conservation and housing and support for at-risk and homeless youth” and would have affected impacted communities in Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Las Vegas, Taos and Ruidoso.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9541-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-09-03 10:56:29.387352

Now, federal officials say that funding — totaling nearly $185 million — is heading out to the states after all.
AmeriCorps officials said in a filing Thursday in the U.S. District Court for Maryland, that the $185 million represents the remainder of the funding appropriated by Congress for AmeriCorps in the current fiscal year. AmeriCorps pledged to apportion the funds by Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal 2025.
The unlocked funding will go to several different service programs nationwide, including AmeriCorps Seniors, which connects Americans 55 and up with service opportunities, including helping children learn to read, assisting the elderly and responding to natural disasters. Some will go to state-level service commissions, too.
At least $2 million of the $185 million is bound for Maryland, court records show. It will go to programs such as the Maryland Reading Corps, which provides children with literacy tutors, and Frostburg State University’s ASTAR program, through which AmeriCorps members contribute to educational programming, food pantries, health care and more in rural Western Maryland.
In a news release Friday, Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown held the new development up as a win for his office, which leads the multistate lawsuit against cuts to AmeriCorps, originally filed in late April.

“This is a major victory for Maryland’s most vulnerable and the AmeriCorps members who serve them,” Brown said Friday. “This outcome provides security for the programs and dedicated AmeriCorps members who tutor and mentor struggling Maryland students and give food to Marylanders who need it. By protecting these programs, we are defending the wellbeing of thousands of Marylanders who depend on this critical support to live full, healthy lives.”
Besides Maryland, other parties to the suit include the District of Columbia and the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.
The AmeriCorps saga began in April, when Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, placed an estimated 85% of headquarters staff at AmeriCorps on leave, and dismissed thousands of AmeriCorps members completing community service projects across the nation. The decision was based on issues uncovered in recent financial audits of the national service organization, White House officials said.
In Maryland, the abrupt termination devastated AmeriCorps members who were busy serving inside state parks, educational centers and other institutions. The Maryland-led lawsuit, challenging an estimated $400 million in cuts, came shortly thereafter.
By early June, a Maryland federal judge issued a preliminary injunction, stating that AmeriCorps would have to temporarily reverse the cuts in the 24 jurisdictions that filed suit while the litigation proceeded. The injunction did not impact cuts in other states, or the staffing reductions at AmeriCorps headquarters.
But earlier this month came another wrinkle.
The states reported in a filing that the federal Office of Budget and Management was “refusing to release tens of millions of dollars that Congress already appropriated, and that AmeriCorps chose to award to service programs for fiscal year 2025.”
They requested another preliminary injunction from the court, arguing that the funding was being withheld unlawfully, and it should be restored.
The feds were due to reply on Thursday, and that’s when they filed an update, stating that the $185 million was being released.
Attorneys for the Justice Department  wrote that “in light of this development, the Parties are conferring about the appropriate next steps in this litigation, including whether the preliminary injunction motion still requires the Court’s resolution or whether it may be withdrawn.”

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that he will no longer recommend that healthy children and pregnant people get COVID-19 shots. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)At the end of August, the Food and Drug Administration approved updated vaccines for COVID-19. While previous versions of the vaccine were recommended to individuals 6 months of age and older, access to the FDA’s newly approved vaccines is limited to individuals 65 and older and individuals between the age of 5 and 64 with an underlying condition placing them at high risk for severe COVID-19.
With Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, taking control of the agency in February, the usual process for issuing guidance on the vaccine has been upended, leading to a split between leading health authorities, and a potential gap in vaccine availability for children, who are among the most at risk for severe illness, hospitalization, and complications from the disease.

“I really don’t fully understand it. I’ll be real honest with you, and I’m not sure most physicians who understand the data can make sense of it either, right? There doesn’t seem to be a good reason for restricting the vaccine to only those with underlying health conditions under the age of 65,”  Dr. Molly O’Shea, a pediatrician and member of the teaching faculty for the residency program at the Children’s Hospital of Michigan told the Michigan Advance in a Tuesday interview.
For members of the medical community, suddenly shifting from widespread availability to dialing back access is not something that makes sense for the FDA, O’Shea said, as there has not been a shift in complications from the vaccines or issues with the vaccine’s effectiveness to drive that change.
Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control no longer recommends COVID-19 vaccination for children ranging from 6 months to 17 years of age.
However the American Academy of Pediatrics has offered its own guidance, recommending all children 6 to 23 months old receive the vaccine, and for children 2 to 18 years old at high risk, or whose parents desire to protect their children from the illness.
Vaccines are the safest and most effective way for our immune system to learn how to respond to a virus, O’Shea explained.
Additionally, having the vaccine as your baseline exposure to COVID-19 comes with some safety from complications from the illness including multi-inflammatory system response, Long COVID, and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, O’Shea said.
“For all of those reasons, it matters for young children to have access to the vaccine while they’re still kind of freshly unaware that COVID exists,” O’Shea said.
Reducing access to the vaccine, O’Shea said, promotes a mindset for families — particularly families who were already somewhat less inclined towards vaccination — that the COVID-19 vaccine isn’t of value.
There’s also been a lot of conversation on how physicians and other healthcare providers can give permission for individuals who want to receive the vaccine outside of the current recommendations, also referred to as off-label use, either in office or through a pharmacy.
“I really think that’s a very nuanced and challenging issue, because in any other circumstance in which we’re writing something off label, for off-label use, it isn’t a scenario in which the data has not been assessed by the FDA,” O’Shea said.
Liability
O’Shea also pointed to liability concerns if a vaccine is prescribed for off-label use and a patient has an adverse reaction.
According to a publication from the American Academy of Pediatrics, clinicians prescribing the vaccine could have two layers of protection, stemming from malpractice insurance and the PREP Act, which provides broad immunity from state and federal liability.
However immunity under the PREP Act is not guaranteed, with the academy encouraging physicians to check their malpractice coverage to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are not excluded.
“The goal of this whole thing is to scare people out of giving vaccines,” O’Shea said.
When looking for a list of underlying conditions to qualify for the vaccine, O’Shea pointed to an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which lays out which conditions qualify, including conditions like asthma, diabetes, cerebrovascular disorder, chronic kidney disease, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, heart conditions, certain mental health disorders and more.
Asked for advice for parents who want to make sure their children are protected in light of the FDA’s restricted access to the COVID-19, O’Shea offered two recommendations.
The first, if parents are uncertain their otherwise healthy child will be able to receive the COVID vaccine, is to go to their local health department.
“[The health department has] made it clear that they’re not going to turn anybody away who wants to receive COVID vaccine. So that’s encouraging,” O’Shea said.
The second: “Please contact your legislators, both in the House and in the Senate,” O’Shea said. With Kennedy set to testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Sept. 4, O’Shea said the more legislators hear from real people, the better.

Judge Gibson previously ruled — based on a decision last year by the Utah Supreme Court — that the Legislature had violated voters’ constitutional right to make laws when legislators repealed Proposition 4, the citizen-passed Better Boundaries initiative. (Pool photo by Trent Nelson/The Salt Lake Tribune) Third District Court Judge Dianna Gibson issued a decision late Tuesday denying Utah lawmakers’ attorneys’ request to push pause on her ruling last week that tossed out the state’s current congressional boundaries and ordered lawmakers to draw a new map. 
“By granting a stay and proceeding with the 2026 election under the current 2021 Congressional Plan, this Court would be sanctioning the Legislature’s violation of the people’s constitutional right to reform their government through redistricting legislation,” the judge wrote in the decision. 
Judge orders Utah Legislature to draw new congressional maps

Last week, Gibson ruled the Utah Legislature unconstitutionally overturned Better Boundaries’ ballot initiative known as Proposition 4, a voter-approved law that created an independent redistricting commission meant to prevent partisan gerrymandering. The 2021 Utah Legislature repealed and replaced it with a new law, SB200, which turned that commission into an advisory body that lawmakers could ignore — which they ultimately did when they adopted the 2021 congressional map.
Delaying the order “would sanction the wholesale repeal of Proposition 4 and would irreparably harm the people of Utah,” the judge wrote Tuesday. “Given the Court’s ruling, this Court cannot conclude that a ‘stay’ would be just under the circumstances.”
Gibson’s ruling has major implications for the future of Utah’s federal political landscape. Before the 2021 map was adopted, one of Utah’s four U.S. House seats was competitive for Democrats. Today, Republicans consistently dominate all four. 
Utah’s redistricting ruling catches Trump’s ire

Her ruling comes during a time when fights over redistricting are on the national stage. While redistricting efforts in Texas, California and other states are playing out mid-decade — fueled by President Donald Trump’s aim to bolster the U.S. House’s slim GOP majority in the 2026 midterm elections — Utah’s effort for an independent and nonpartisan process is court ordered.
Gibson, in her decision issued Tuesday, said the state could set itself apart from other states.
“Utah has an opportunity to be different,” the judge wrote. “While other states are currently redrawing their congressional plans to intentionally render some citizen votes meaningless, Utah could redesign its congressional plan with an intention to protect its citizens’ right to vote and to ensure that each citizen’s vote is meaningful.” 
Gibson also acknowledged that the “timing of this ruling,” along with the injunction on the 2021 Congressional Map, “presents challenges for the Legislature … to accomplish its duty” to draw a new map in compliance with Proposition 4 in time for the 2026 elections.
GOP legislative leaders begrudgingly say they’ll redraw Utah’s congressional map, as court ordered

In an effort to address those timing challenges, Gibson asked the lieutenant governor’s office if there would be any flexibility — even if it’s a matter of days — to push back the previously set deadline of Nov. 1 for the court to select a new map while also allowing enough time for counties to finalize their precincts before candidates can begin filing in January. 
In a court filing also submitted Tuesday, attorneys for Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson wrote that after consulting with county clerks “and due to the extenuating circumstances of this litigation, the deadline for congressional map submission for this election cycle is Nov. 10, 2025.” 
Given that new deadline, it’s likely Gibson will offer some adjustments to the proposed timeline she included in her order last week, which gave lawmakers, plaintiffs and third parties until Sept. 24 to submit their proposed congressional maps for the court to choose from.

Sept. 5, 2023. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With Maine Gov. Janet Mills set to term out after eight years, the field for the November 2026 gubernatorial election is packed with candidates with a spectrum of experience and views. 
Those running as either Democrats or Republicans will first face off against each other in the June 9, 2026 primaries in an effort to win over their base and secure their party’s nomination.
Open to all Maine voters, the primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot, though the general election in November will not. With at least one political heavyweight, Maine Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, opting out of either major political party, it remains to be seen how that could influence Maine’s historically independent electorate.
The field is already crowded with several well known names vying for the Democratic Party nomination, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, former speaker of the Maine House of Representatives and daughter of a U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, Hannah Pingree, and Angus King III, son of Maine’s independent U.S. senator.
Whoever becomes Maine’s next governor will take the helm for the remaining two years of President Donald Trump’s second term, and will have to navigate massive cuts in funding, the dismantling of federal agencies and programs, and greater pressure on states to conform with his agenda amid increased economic uncertainty.
Here’s the latest on the race for Maine governor.

Gubernatorial candidate Troy Jackson joined U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner at a packed rally at the Cross Insurance Arena in Portland on Labor Day.
Addressing the crowd of 6,500, Jackson used his speech to differentiate himself from other Democratic candidates.
“We have tried it their way and it doesn’t work,” said Jackson, a fifth-generation logger from Allagash. “It’s time for regular folks to take the wheel. Hell, we built the wheel.”
Sanders, an independent who ran twice for the Democratic nomination for president, endorsed both Jackson and Platner in their respective races.

Former Maine CDC head Dr. Nirav Shah considering bid for governor


By: Lauren McCauley - Friday August 15, 2025 2:53 pm





Another popular figure in Maine is considering a run for governor. 
Dr. Nirav Shah told the Portland Press Herald in an interview Friday that he’s considering entering the race as a Democrat, which would have him joining a field already crowded with well-known players in Maine politics.  
Shah became a household figure as head of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic, holding daily briefings during which he would answer questions and provide updates on the public health crisis. He often appeared alongside Maine officials, including Gov. Janet Mills. 
He told the paper that experience gave him an appreciation for the impact state government can make on people’s lives.
“What attracted me in particular to the governor’s office is the impact you can have in the executive branch,” Shah said.
In January 2023, he was appointed as the principal deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under former President Joe Biden. Recently, he returned to Maine to launch a public health education program at Colby College, where he is a visiting professor.









Retired DEP employee is third independent to join the race for governor


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Thursday August 7, 2025 5:44 pm





A former longtime state government employee is running for governor as an independent.
John Glowa of South China is the most recent candidate to add his name to the growing list of gubernatorial candidates. So far, 16 people have entered the race, including three independents.
The most prominent of those is State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, who left the Republican Party earlier this year to announce his run, in addition to Dover-Foxcroft resident Alexander Murchison, according to the Maine Ethics Commission website.
Glowa worked for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection as an environmental specialist from 1987 until 2016, according to his campaign website. He then retired and ran for state representative as a member of the Democratic Party, and then for a seat in the Maine Senate.
He also founded the Maine Wolf Coalition, which advocates for wolf recovery in the northeast, and has accused state wildlife officials of deliberately downplaying evidence of wolves’ presence in the state.

Here are the Republicans vying to replace Gov. Janet Mills next November


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday August 6, 2025 8:04 am





Ben Midgley, a fitness executive from Kennebunkport, on Tuesday officially became the seventh Republican candidate in a crowded race for Gov. Janet Mills’ seat.
Midgley is the latest of 17 officially registered candidates vying to replace Mills, a Democrat who terms out next year. Both the Republican and Democratic primaries, slated for June 9, 2026, are open to all Maine voters. The primaries will be a ranked-choice ballot though the general election for governor in November will not.
Most of the Republican candidates listed on the Maine Ethics Commission website have not held public office at the state level, with the exception of state Sen. Jim Libby (R-Standish). Bobby Charles, a lawyer who served under former Republican presidents, and former Paris selectman Robert Wessels have also been involved in politics in different capacities.
In contrast, the Democratic field is stacked with party leaders, including Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson, and former Speaker of the Maine House of Representative and Mills administration official Hannah Pingree, among others.
Other GOP candidates, including University of Maine System trustee Owen McCarthy, tout their financial credentials while framing themselves as political outsiders. All seven appear to have varying stances on issues including the economy, education and immigration, but almost all have expressed concern about the increasing cost of living in Maine, which according to a Pan Atlantic Research poll conducted this year was the biggest concern expressed by voters.

Republican Sen. Rick Bennett announces independent bid for Maine governor


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 24, 2025 12:03 pm





After decades of public service as a Republican, state Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford announced on Tuesday that he is running for governor as an independent.
“My candidacy is not an indictment of either party,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star in an interview. “It’s an indictment of the party structure and parties as the solution to solving our problems.”
Calling his independent bid liberating, Bennett said he intends to take his message — one of fiscal responsibility — directly to Maine people and not a subset of the electorate, an approach he sees as a return to Maine’s independent tradition.
“I see politics beginning to slide more towards the politics of Washington,” Bennett said, “and I think we have the opportunity as Maine people to say no to that.”

She kicked off the campaign with several planned stops around the state on Tuesday, starting with a rally in Rockland, scheduled meetings with local leaders in Lewiston and Biddeford before capping off the day with a celebration in Portland.
Pingree left her role as head of Gov. Janet Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, also known as GOPIF, which she held since 2019. The office was created to recommend policy solutions for some of the state’s biggest issues including climate change, housing, workforce development, the opioid crisis and more.

State Sen. James Libby is running in the 2026 gubernatorial race.
Libby, who represents parts of Cumberland, Oxford and York counties, is one of five Republican candidates contending for the Blaine House, according to filings with the Maine Ethics Commission.
The race is already starting to get crowded, with the Democratic ticket drawing notable names including Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who announced her bid in late March, as well as Angus King III, the son of independent U.S. senator and former governor Angus King Jr., who announced his run earlier this month.
Libby is in the middle of his second consecutive term in the Senate, but he has also spent time as a state representative after being first elected to the Legislature in 1992. He also ran in the 2002 Republican gubernatorial primary.

“I’m so grateful to Governor Mills for the tremendous opportunity she gave me to dive into Maine’s biggest challenges and lead work across her administration to chart a path to solutions,” Pingree said in a news release from the governor’s office Thursday.
Though the release didn’t specify what Pingree plans to do next, she said she will “remain relentlessly focused on the future of the state we all love.” The Bangor Daily News has reported that Pingree is expected to throw her hat in the ring for the Democratic gubernatorial primary next year.

Aug. 8, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceTom Leonard, one of several Republicans seeking the party’s nomination for governor in 2026, on Wednesday announced a plan to rein in Lansing lawmakers and the executive branch if elected next year.
Leonard’s proposal would include the introduction of an independent ethics commission and a modernized Hatch Act for Michigan strengthening whistleblower protections.
The Hatch Act, a 1939 federal law, forbids federal employees and civil service workers from engaging in political campaigning while on duty, driving a government car, wearing an official uniform or using a government building or room. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Leonard also seeks enactment of Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, reforms that would include the Legislature and the governor’s office, which has been a long-sought policy goal of state Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Southfield).
Gubernatorial candidates from all political stripes in Michigan have long promised FOIA and other ethics reforms but have stopped short of fulfilling those promises.
Leonard said Wednesday that it was high time for real accountability and transparency in Lansing.
“People in Michigan work hard, pay their taxes, and follow the rules. They deserve a government that does the same,” Leonard said. “No more self-policing. No more secret handouts. No more backroom deals. This package will deliver the honest, accountable government people deserve.”
Leonard’s diagnosis of Lansing’s problems was threefold. The former speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives said politicians at the Capitol largely police themselves, and that they exist in a cash-for-votes culture that allows them to raise big money on the same days that they cast votes on important issues. He added that FOIA’s loophole exemptions for the legislative and executive branches furthers residents’ distrust of the political process.
“When top officials break the law, they’re allowed to investigate themselves. That’s not justice – that’s a cover-up. Right now, lawmakers can raise big money on the same days they’re voting on bills or having committee hearings. People see that as pay-to-play politics,” Leonard wrote in a campaign news release. “The governor’s office and the Legislature are exempt from FOIA, and staff are even forced into non-disclosure agreements. Decisions that affect everyday families are happening in the dark.”
Leonard’s solutions include an ethics commission that would act as a true watchdog with subpoena power, a Hatch Act for Michigan adding serious fines for politicians using legislative staff on political campaigns, and banning fundraising on all legislative session days through a Legislative Integrity Act.
“People in Michigan work hard, pay their taxes, and follow the rules,” Leonard said. “They deserve a government that does the same,” Leonard said. “No more self-policing. No more secret handouts. No more backroom deals. This package will deliver the honest, accountable government people deserve.”
Leonard is poised to face former Michigan attorney general Mike Cox, former congressional candidate Anthony Hudson, U.S. Rep. John James, state Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, William Null and Karla Wagner in the Republican primary next August.
On the Democratic side of the race is Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson and former Cape Coral, Fla. Mayor Marni Sawicki.

Stremple, who will start Oct. 20, will replace the Beacon’s founding editor, Andrew Kitchenman. He resigned last month in order to take an editor role at the Philadelphia Inquirer.
The Beacon is an affiliate of the national nonprofit States Newsroom, which conducted the hiring process.
“We are thrilled to welcome Claire back to the Beacon as editor and look forward to more great reporting from our talented team under her leadership,” said Chris Fitzsimon, publisher and CEO of States Newsroom, in a written statement.
Stremple worked at the Beacon from spring 2023 through fall 2024 after prior work as a reporter for KTOO and KHNS-FM public radio in Haines.
While at KTOO, she won the Alaska Press Club’s 2022 Public Service Award for reporting that exposed a large backlog at Alaska’s Division of Public Assistance. After leaving the Beacon in 2024, she returned to KTOO as its editor.
Fitzsimon said he selected Stremple from among many applicants based on her leadership at KTOO, her prior experience at the Beacon, and her commitment to Alaska journalism.
By phone, Stremple said she wants to return to the Beacon because she enjoyed working with its reporters, “and I think that the capitol is a really exciting place to be doing state politics news reporting. I think there’s a lot of opportunity for investigative work there, and that prospect is really exciting to me. So it’s really exciting to be back with the team and be back in the capitol.”

This year, at least two major city agencies — the New York Police Department and the Dallas Police Department — have cut some education requirements for new recruits.
In February, the NYPD reduced its college credit requirement for police academy entry from 60 credits to 24. Following a new policy approval in June, the Dallas Police Department began allowing applicants with only a high school diploma or GED to qualify if they also have three consecutive years of full-time work experience.
Police agencies nationwide are loosening education requirements in an effort to address years of staffing shortages. The changes also come as President Donald Trump has drawn more attention to crime and public safety by deploying the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, and signaling plans to expand federal enforcement efforts in Chicago and other cities. (A federal judge on Tuesday ruled Trump’s mobilization of U.S. Marines and the California National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles this summer violated federal law.) Trump also has taken over the District of Columbia’s police department.
Reports of violent crime nationwide have been decreasing since 2022. Some communities, though, are still facing higher rates of certain crimes, including homicide.
The changes in New York City and Dallas are part of a yearslong trend of police departments easing college requirements, a shift that includes Boise, Idaho; Chicago; Louisville, Kentucky; New Orleans; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Memphis, Tennessee; and Bellingham, Washington. Even some state police agencies, such as the Kentucky State Police and the Pennsylvania State Police, have followed suit.
But these changes in education requirements aren’t limited to local and state forces. The FBI — which for decades required a four-year degree — will no longer mandate one for new recruits starting in October. New recruits also will receive just eight weeks of training, down from the previous 18-week standard, according to The New York Times.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also has loosened standards as the Trump administration seeks to expand immigration enforcement. The agency removed its five-week Spanish-language training requirement. Translation needs would instead be met through unspecified technology, The Intercept reported.
ICE has paired these changes with aggressive incentives, including signing bonuses of up to $50,000, as much as $60,000 in student loan repayment and retirement benefits.
These changes reflect a broader challenge in policing: Agencies are still struggling to recruit and retain officers amid increased public attention and shifting workforce expectations.
“The demand exceeds the supply, and what’s happened is the environment for being a police officer has changed,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a national nonprofit think tank on policing standards. “The expectations have never been higher.”
Resignations and retirements rose sharply after 2020, when nationwide protests put law enforcement under closer public scrutiny following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. Additionally, some officers are leaving big-city departments for smaller agencies. At the same time, some experts say, police agencies are competing in a tight labor market in which shift jobs may be less appealing than positions with regular hours, higher pay or remote work options.
In recent years, the push for better-educated officers has been rooted in research suggesting that college graduates are less likely to use force and perform better on the job. But some say that strict education mandates can shrink the applicant pool and shouldn’t be the sole measure of what makes a good officer.
“College education, in the greater scheme of things, is advantageous. It’s necessary, but not sufficient,” Wexler said, noting that agencies should also weigh a recruit’s work history, maturity, judgement and other characteristics.
Agencies of all sizes also have adjusted other standards to attract more applicants — raising or lowering minimum age limits, loosening tattoo policies, scaling back fitness tests and waiving exam fees.
In some departments, these changes have sparked a surge in applications, but they haven’t always translated into higher staffing levels overall.
Following the NYPD’s announcement in February that it was changing its education requirement, daily applications jumped from an average of 53 to 231, according to a news release. In early August, the agency swore in 1,093 recruits — its largest incoming class since January 2016.
The New Orleans Police Department nixed its college education requirement in 2015 and saw a surge of 7,440 applications just two years later.
But hiring never kept pace: The department brought on about 100 recruits a year, and far fewer after 2020, according to the city’s hiring dashboard. In 2024, the department received 1,575 applications and hired just 35 recruits.
A report from the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s office released late last year found that between 2019 and 2023, the department lost nearly 27% of its policing staff.
 
Solving the staffing crisis
Staffing shortfalls have been a long-standing challenge for law enforcement agencies, stretching back well before 2020. But in recent years, hiring has improved in some parts of the country.
The latest Police Executive Research Forum survey, based on responses from 217 agencies across 39 states and the District of Columbia, suggests staffing trends are uneven.
As of Jan. 1, sworn staffing was up slightly from the year before but still 5.2% below 2020 levels, according to the survey. Large departments saw modest growth in 2024 but still employ 6% fewer officers than in 2020, while medium and small agencies have not just recovered but now surpass 2020 levels.
“This period we’re in now, and we have been in for the last few years, is the most challenging time to hire a police officer,” Wexler said.
In recent years, state legislatures also have looked into the education requirements for police. In 2023, for example, Oregon lawmakers considered a bill that would have required at least two years of higher education for departments with fewer than 50 officers and a bachelor’s degree for departments with more than 50. It would have applied to police, corrections, parole, probation and reserve officers, but the bill stalled in a Senate committee.
More recently, lawmakers in California are considering a bill that would, starting in 2031, require incoming officers to obtain a policing certificate, associate degree or bachelor’s degree within 36 months of graduating from a police academy. Incoming officers could also meet the requirement through prior military service or out-of-state law enforcement experience.
The proposal has received widespread support from many law enforcement agencies and groups in the state, including the California Police Chiefs Association, California State Sheriffs’ Association and the Peace Officers Research Association of California.
The sheriffs’ association praised the legislation, writing in a statement that it offers a range of acceptable experiences — “enhancing academic rigor” — without burdensome requirements that could hurt agencies’ recruiting goals.
Police education requirements are often set by individual departments or local jurisdictions, rather than written into state law. Across the country, most local law enforcement agencies require only a high school diploma or GED, though officers with a college degree may have more opportunities for promotions and higher pay.
“Educational standards across law enforcement agencies vary considerably,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University.
Some agencies also have created pathways for new officers to earn college credit through completing the police academy program and offer tuition reimbursement for those who want to pursue advanced degrees.
But La Vigne told Stateline that in-service training, organizational structure, leadership and accountability mechanisms within a department also play a key role in shaping a well-rounded officer.
“Those factors, I think, override anything as simple as ‘We’re requiring or removing education as a threshold for employment,’” La Vigne said. “Educational requirements alone are not the biggest factor.”
 
What makes a good cop
What makes a good police officer has long been debated, with discussions often centering on the role of education, training and personal qualities.
Some argue that, rather than lowering education requirements, departments should improve people’s perceptions of the police by becoming more involved in the community, especially at a time when heightened scrutiny has made the job less appealing to some.
“It’s trying to fix the problem assuming that the way things work now is the way things are supposed to be,” said Jim Nolan, a sociology professor at West Virginia University and a speaker with the nonprofit Law Enforcement Action Partnership. Nolan previously served as a police officer and as an FBI unit chief. “It’s the approach to policing that’s wrong.”
Some research suggests that college-educated officers use force less often, face fewer complaints and are disciplined less frequently than their peers without a degree. Some policing experts say a college education may give officers a broader perspective on a range of issues while also strengthening critical thinking and teamwork skills.
Research also suggests that college-educated officers are stronger writers, which can lead to clearer investigations and casework, according to a 2017 report on higher education in policing.
But some experts still caution that the research is not conclusive and argue that education alone isn’t enough to determine what makes a good police officer.
“Having a college education by itself doesn’t mean you will be a better police officer,” said Wexler, of the Police Executive Research Forum.

What makes a good police officer has long been debated, with discussions often centering on the role of education, training and personal qualities.










Having a college education by itself doesn’t mean you will be a better police officer.


– Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Research Executive Forum


Some argue that, rather than lowering education requirements, departments should improve people’s perceptions of the police by becoming more involved in the community, especially at a time when heightened scrutiny has made the job less appealing to some.
“It’s trying to fix the problem assuming that the way things work now is the way things are supposed to be,” said Jim Nolan, a sociology professor at West Virginia University and a speaker with the nonprofit Law Enforcement Action Partnership.

Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities recently raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.
Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.

Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.
The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.
“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”
Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.
One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.
“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”
Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.
Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.
After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.
After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.
“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”
In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.
Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.
“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”
After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.
The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.
Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.
A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.
The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.
“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.
Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.
The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.
Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.
One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.
The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.
“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”
Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.
“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.
On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.
“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”
Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.
“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”
Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.
“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”
In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.

(Courtesy of Kleban for Maine)Another Democrat, co-founder of Maine Beer Company Dan Kleban, has entered the race to try to unseat long-time Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins in 2026. 
Announcing his candidacy on Wednesday, the 48-year-old Cumberland County resident said he’s running because he feels a responsibility to do what’s right for Maine, like when he started his company with his wife and brother after being laid off from a law firm during the Great Recession.
“Executives at the big banks who crashed our economy walked away without facing any consequences. I was pissed,” Kleban said in a statement. “So my brother and I started Maine Beer Company not only to make good beer, but to live by our Do What’s Right motto that crooks on Wall Street never understood.” In practice, that motto means providing fully paid health care and donating 1% of all annual sales to environmental nonprofits, he added.
Now, Kleban said the same thing is happening in Congress, specifically calling out Collins, whose actions he sees hardworking Mainers paying the price for as they struggle to afford housing, health care, groceries and electric bills.
Maine’s Senate race heated up last month when Graham Platner, a largely unknown oysterman and military veteran, entered the race at the encouragement of unions. Platner’s campaign raised $1 million in the first nine days and he was endorsed by independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at a Labor Day rally attended by more than 6,500 in Portland. 
Kleban’s launch video and website make some similar appeals as Platner. Kleban emphasizes his working-class roots and student debt, living many of the affordability challenges he believes other Mainers want their elected officials to fix. 
Most of the people vying for Collins’ seat are political newcomers, Platner and Kleban included. One Democratic candidate, Jordan Wood, is a former congressional aide who has spent about a decade working in politics in Washington, D.C. 
Establishment Democrats have been trying to convince Maine Gov. Janet Mills to run. She’s still unsure but said she’d likely decide by mid-November. 
As for a primary challenge, Maine Republicans and Trump have rejected the idea, though President Donald Trump has said behind closed doors that he’d welcome a “better option.” He’s also recently revoked the otherwise unusual public deference he’d shown Collins. 
Kleban spoke about the president being a threat to the values of Mainers in his launch video and said Collins “refuses to stand up to Donald Trump when it really matters.” 
Kleban also criticized Collins’ 2018 vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, the majority of which then stripped nationwide abortion protections when overturning Roe vs. Wade.

(Courtesy of the Utah Office of Homeless Services)After months of tight-lipped searching, state officials have announced the property they’ve zeroed in on for a new 1,300-bed “transformative” homeless campus. 
The Utah Office of Homeless Services and the Utah Homeless Services Board announced early Wednesday morning a contractual agreement for the state to acquire a 15.85-acre property that’s currently owned by Salt Lake City. 
That property, located at 2520 N. 2200 West, Salt Lake City, is an open field located directly west of I-215 and roughly a mile south from North Salt Lake’s city boundaries. 
Just south of the property is a warehouse park, and to its north is a small agricultural neighborhood. Directly to the east, across I-215, is a horse boarding facility, Hunter Stable & Arena. It’s also located relatively near the Jordan River OHV State Recreation Area. 
Wednesday’s announcement is a major development for the Utah Office of Homeless Services and the Utah Homeless Board in their efforts to increase the state’s emergency homeless shelter capacity while also envisioning not just a shelter, but a “campus” to help people turn their lives around and move out of homelessness. 
Utah homelessness rose 18% in 2025, state report says

“This is more than a campus, it’s a turning point for Utah of reimagining hope,” Wayne Niederhauser, the state’s homeless coordinator, said in a prepared statement. “It will further fulfil the identified need to provide additional beds and treatment in Utah’s homeless response while providing individuals served by the campus a transformative path from crisis to stability and, ultimately, thriving.”
The new homeless campus is envisioned to be a “comprehensive hub where individuals experiencing homelessness can access the support and treatment they need to move from homelessness to stability and long-term self-reliance,” the Utah Office of Homeless Services said in Wednesday morning’s announcement. 
“Designed to complement the existing homeless resource centers, shelters and service providers throughout Utah, the transformative campus is a place where those experiencing homelessness find help for recovery, employment, criminal justice assistance, and housing, accessible in a single location,” the office continued.
Niederhauser and his office have been on the hunt for a property for close to a year, after the Utah Homeless Services Board last fall set a deadline of Oct. 1, 2025, for the campus to be built. Niederhauser told Utah News Dispatch last month that that deadline likely won’t be met, since the search has proven difficult and taken longer than previously expected. 
Last fall, a delegation of Utah leaders — including Niederhauser, other Homeless Services Board members, officials from Salt Lake County and Salt Lake City and others — traveled to San Antonio, Texas, where they visited Haven for Hope, a nationally recognized nonprofit, which is described as “more than a shelter,” and a “transformational campus” on its website. They envision Utah’s campus will be modeled similarly. 
Throughout their search, state officials have declined to publicly share what properties they’ve been considering, citing real estate acquisition privacy considerations. 
There’s still work to be done, however, before the campus can be built. 
According to state officials, a feasibility study on the property has been completed and environmental studies are ongoing. 
18% rise in Utah homelessness should be ‘battle cry’ for lawmakers to do more, SLC mayor says

“The next steps are to secure funding partnerships, continue to engage with community stakeholders, service providers, and state leaders to bring the campus to actualization,” the Utah Homeless Services Office said. “It is anticipated that the initial operations of the campus will begin in 2027.
Meanwhile, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall — who is also a member of the Utah Homeless Services Board — has been urging the state to act quickly. 
On Aug. 13, the day a state report was released showing an 18% rise in Utah homelessness, Mendenhall said that number should be heard as a “battle cry” for Utah lawmakers to do more to address homelessness. 
The mayor also warned there’s “inadequate funding to build and non-existent funding to operate a new campus shelter.” For 2025, the Utah Legislature budgeted $50 million in additional state spending for emergency shelter, including $25 million to build “low-barrier shelter.” Some of that was used to keep winter beds open, while some is also meant to be used to site and build the homeless campus. 
But that’s not enough money to both build and fund ongoing operations for the new campus, so Mendenhall urged lawmakers to appropriate more during their 2026 general session in January.
Still, the mayor applauded the site announcement as a step forward.  
“Our state has long needed more shelter beds and services, and this campus represents a critical step forward in supporting the most vulnerable people in our communities,” Mendenhall said in a prepared statement.

“By providing consistent shelter and wraparound services in one location, this facility could also help Salt Lake City first responders by reducing the number of emergency calls, freeing up law enforcement to focus on public safety, and better connecting people to the help they need,” she added. 
Randy Shumway, chair of the Utah Homeless Services Board, applauded the campus vision during a time when Utah’s homeless population has been increasing. 
“Despite tremendous effort, resources, and goodwill across the state, homelessness in Utah has continued to worsen — for both those experiencing it and for our communities,” Shumway said. “The proposed Utah campus will take a human-first approach that provides healing and stability while embedding accountability at every stage.”
According to Wednesday’s announcement, state officials envision the homeless campus as a “‘hub and spoke’ system, where individuals can Step In to access core services at a centralized hub, and once stabilized and ready to Step Up, they can Step Out to be connected efficiently to additional specialized resources across the community — the spokes.”
“This model reduces barriers to service access, increases operational efficiency, and strengthens the broader network of support,” the office said. “By expanding capacity and improving the overall system’s accessibility, the campus would enhance the sustainability and effectiveness of the region’s homelessness response.”
Shumway said the campus, “by pairing compassionate support and medical care with clear expectations and opportunities for growth,” it’s envisioned to help people “reclaim their inherent dignity, achieve self-reliance, and live drug-free, crime-free, and contributing lives.”

(Photo by Alex Simpson/U.S. Bureau of Land Management Alaska Fire Service)Alaska wildfires burned more than 1 million acres this year, putting the 2025 season at about the average for recent decades.
Alaska fire seasons of more than 1 million acres have become more frequent since about 1990, records show. Since then, 1 million acres is in the “near-normal category,” said Rick Thoman, a scientist with the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Preparedness at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
But it was an unusual season in some ways, Thoman said.
The season started slowly, with only 38 acres burned in early June, a notably cool period, he said. That was despite concerns that a lack of snow in Southcentral Alaska would bring about an early fire season.
The slow start shows the importance of weather patterns to wildfire fire starts, he said. Fires start in dry, warm and windy conditions, with some kind of spark, he said. “You need all the ingredients,” he said. “Some of the ingredients don’t work – you need all of them.”
Fire activity then exploded later in June, thanks to over 80,000 lightning strikes around the time of the summer solstice. Between June 15 and June 29, there were 162 new lightning-caused wildfires in Alaska, according to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s Alaska Fire Service.
 

A graph shows how Alaska wildfire acreage has fluctuated since 1950. Wildfire seasons of at least 1 million have become more frequent since 1990. (Graph provided by Rick Thoman/Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Preparedness/University of Alaska Fairbanks)
 

	Another unusual feature of the season was the number of big wildfires that burned simultaneously near population centers, prompting some evacuations and strains on firefighting resources.
A pair of fires called the Nenana Ridge Complex burned over 32,000 acres and prompted evacuations in the area between Fairbanks and Nenana. Other Fairbanks-area fires burned as well. The Bear Creek Fire and St. George Creek Fire in the Denali Borough together totaled about 71,000 acres, and some residents’ homes were burned. There were also fires near Tok and Delta Junction in the eastern Interior region.
For Fairbanks-area residents, wildfires brought another season of smoky skies.
Though the smoke was not especially heavy, this summer was the fourth in a row in which it caused at least 100 hours of reduced visibility at the Fairbanks International Airport. That is an unprecedented series, Thoman said.
“Prior to this streak, there had never been more than back-to-back summers with 100 hours or more,” he said.
Some northern fires were noteworthy.
The 307-acre Fortymile Fire in the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge was suppressed as part of a new strategy to protect ice-rich permafrost and prevent carbon emission caused by thaw.

	There were also several fires in the treeless tundra of the North Slope, a region where fires have been limited in the past by normally moist conditions and a lack of flammable vegetation. Most of the North Slope tundra fires were small, but there were two substantial fires: the Ikpikpuk Fire, which burned about 2,000 acres, and the Bronx fire, which burned about 618 acres.
In all, 458 wildfires had burned over Alaska’s season, as of Tuesday, according to the federal-state Alaska Interagency Coordination Center.
Alaska’s fire season may not be entirely over.
One fire at the Alaska-Canada border, estimated at 0.5 acres as of Tuesday, was attributed to a lightning strike that occurred about two weeks ago. The fire was burning in dense spruce and is an example of lingering fire risks in eastern Interior Alaska, fire managers said.
In recent days, dry and windy conditions led to a series of small fires around Tok and Delta Junction. Because there were no lightning strikes preceding those fires, they are classified as being caused by humans. It remains unclear, however, how people caused those fires, officials said. Fires classified as human-caused can include escaped campfires, fires spread by discarded cigarettes, flames started by sparks from vehicles, machinery or equipment or other means.

(Photo by Bear Gulch Fire 2025 via Facebook)Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities last week raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.
Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.
Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.
The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.
“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”
Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.
One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.
“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”
Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.
Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.
After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.
After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.
“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”
In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.
Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.
“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”
After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.
The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.
Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.
A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.
The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.
“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.
Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.
The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.
Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.
One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.
The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.
“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”
Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.
“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.
On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.
“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”
Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.
“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”
Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.
“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”
In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.

The five Democratic candidates the organization is supporting are: 

Theresa Gillespie Isom (Senate District 2)
Reginald Jackson (Senate District 11) 
Dianne Black (Senate District 19) 
Johnny DuPree (Senate District 45)
Justin Crosby (House District 22)

“The DLCC is proud to support these five Mississippi Democrats running strong campaigns to challenge the toxic GOP power in their state,” said Heather Williams, president of the DLCC. 
Isom and DuPree are the Democratic nominees seeking to win newly redrawn Senate districts with no incumbent in the race. Black and Crosby are trying to topple Republican incumbents. Jackson is a Democratic incumbent attempting to ward off a Republican challenger. 
It’s unclear how much money the organization will funnel to the five candidates, but one of the group’s goals is to signal to potential donors that these Democratic nominees are competitive.
In 2023, the organization also promoted a slate of Democratic candidates seeking to defeat incumbent Republicans in Mississippi. None of those candidates were successful.

Seven years ago, Gov. Gavin Newsom told Californians he wanted to be known for “audacious stretch goals” rather than being too timid. 
His mental health overhaul counts as one of those, from changes that expanded coverage for mental health conditions to last year’s Proposition 1, the ballot measure that poured $6.4 billion into new mental health housing.
A team of CalMatters reporters this week published a deep look into one of the key components of Newsom’s mental health strategy: CARE Court, a program intended to help seriously ill Californians living on the streets. 
They found the program has treated only a small fraction of eligible patients — as in hundreds of people rather than the thousands Newsom projected.

Tanya Fedak, whose son cycles between homelessness and jail despite being accepted into CARE Court: “These are our loved ones. It’s our taxpayers’ money. There’s no accountability. And it’s frustrating to see it go down, because my son is going to end up dead.” 

After requesting data from all of California’s 58 counties (though four did not respond) and conducting more than 30 interviews, CalMatters found that, among other things:

San Diego County received 384 petitions and established 134 voluntary agreements in the first two years. The county anticipated receiving 1,000 petitions and establishing court-ordered treatment plans for 250 people in the first year.


Los Angeles County received 511 petitions (the most in the state) and established 112 treatment agreements or plans. In 2023, county officials predicted the county could enroll 4,500 people in the first year.

Courts also dismissed a large portion of petitions — about 45% statewide. And while only 14 treatment plans have been ordered so far, counties mostly offer voluntary treatment agreements — which people are free to ignore. 
Why the slow progress? 
State officials say CARE Court is a complicated program, which requires more time to hit the goals set by the Newsom administration. But there are other reasons too: Petitions can be rejected due to narrow eligibility criteria; it can be difficult to follow up with an unhoused person; and even with a judge’s order, it can be hard to force a client to accept services after they have already refused.

Trump loses on National Guard in LA

Delivering a blow to President Donald Trump, a federal judge ruled Tuesday that the president acted illegally when he deployed the military in L.A. in June, writes CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.
The order came down amid Trump’s current deployment of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., as well as his threats to send troops to other cities including Oakland, Chicago and New York.
Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee called the ruling “encouraging.”

Lee, in an email to CalMatters: “We understand this doesn’t eliminate the threat of federal overreach. Oakland remains prepared and vigilant in our commitment to protecting our residents.”

In a 52-page opinion, Judge Charles Breyer of the U.S. District Court of Northern California wrote that while there were protests in L.A., “there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law.”
Effective Sept. 12, the judge also blocked the Trump administration from using the military to carry out “arrests … crowd control, riot control” and other activities until the administration can present a valid legal exception. 
Bill Essayli, a prosecutor for the U.S. Department of Justice, said on social media that Breyer’s ruling is “a misleading injunction” and that the military will remain in L.A.

Cities sweep RV encampments

As Gov. Newsom launches a new task force to clear homeless encampments, California cities are focusing on another target: RVs parked on the street and the people who live in them, writes CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall.
In cities including San Jose, San Francisco and San Diego, police use parking ordinances to tow or threaten to tow vehicles in order to sweep vehicle encampments. Last month, San Jose began clearing its largest encampment in Columbus Park, where hundreds of people had been sleeping in cars, RVs and tents.
Homelessness advocates fear that towing these vehicles will worsen the crisis. Owners often can’t afford to pay the towing or storage fees, and could end up on the streets once their vehicles are taken away.
But local officials and some legislators say vehicle encampments attract crime, waste and other public safety hazards. One bill the Legislature is currently considering, which advanced out of the Senate’s appropriations committee last week, would make it easier for certain cities to dispose of RVs parked on their streets.

(Provided by Audubon South Carolina)South Carolina’s state-owned utility company and environmental groups have reached an agreement related to a powerline running through an ancient Lowcountry forest.
Santee Cooper and the National Audubon Society announced the agreement Tuesday. It comes more than a month after Audubon South Carolina raised concerns about the utility company’s plans to increase the capacity on an existing powerline crossing Beidler Forest, the largest uncut cypress-tupelo swamp in the world.
SC utility seeks to upgrade powerline through ancient cypress forest

The upgraded transmission line is necessary, the company said, to power the growing number of homes and businesses in Berkeley, Dorchester and Charleston counties.
Santee Cooper has said it didn’t plan to cut any old-growth trees — cypress or otherwise — as it upgraded the powerline, which has been in place since the 1970s.
“Beidler Forest is a beautiful cypress-tupelo swamp forest, with spectacular old-growth trees and native plants that support numerous bird and other wildlife species. Santee Cooper’s plans will not change that,” CEO Jimmy Staton said in a statement.
Still, Audubon sought added guarantees.
Along parts of the 1½ mile stretch of powerline that runs through the forest, the utility company can down trees within 100 feet of its right of way that it considers a danger to the line.
Santee Cooper agreed to notify Audubon of any trees it plans to cut down, allowing the conservation organization a chance to review and consult on the process, according to documents filed with state utility regulators and a statement from the utility company.
Staton, in his statement, also said Santee Cooper had already contracted with a third-party environmental consultant to be onsite during construction.
In addition, Santee Cooper will pay for a garden of flowering plants beneficial to bees and other pollinators. It will be planted on the Berkeley County side of the powerline’s right of way, according to the filing. It doesn’t specify the size of the garden or what will be planted.
The company will also buy seedlings to plant four acres of hardwood trees in another part of Beidler Forest called Pine Bluff.
“Francis Beidler Forest is a nationally and internationally recognized resource, is treasured by the wildlife that call it home, visitors who explore its ancient forest, and nearby communities that benefit from its conservation,” Audubon South Carolina Executive Director Rebecca Haynes said in a statement. “Audubon, in partnership with the Southern Environmental Law Center, is glad to have reached an agreement that protects the Forest from direct impacts, while allowing Santee Cooper to support the growth of the Lowcountry.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Swamp-fog-and-cypress_Matt-Johnson-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-03 08:59:18.162113

Haley Stevens, a Birmingham Democrat who is running for Michigan’s open U.S. Senate seat, wrongly claimed that she had been endorsed by a county commissioner from Southwest Michigan.
A picture of Berrien County Commissioner Chokwe Pitchford was featured Tuesday in an X post by Stevens labeled as an “Endorsement Alert”, prompting Pitchford to respond with a post of his own disavowing that he had endorsed Stevens.

“I literally never endorsed her or heard a word from her team. I promise you, I have not talked to anyone, emailed anyone about endorsements, or even hinted that I would be open to endorsing her,” Pitchford said in his post on X.
Pitchford later told The Detroit News he believed Stevens “thinks that she is going to just get the Black vote in Michigan and get (the support of) Black elected officials from across the state without having to do any of the actual work and have any policies. That team just assumed that I was going to be backing her, and that was the wrong assumption.”
When asked for a comment on the botched endorsement, Reeves Oyster, campaign spokesperson for Stevens, told Michigan Advance that there had been “a miscommunication.”
“Our campaign is proud to have the endorsements of Michiganders across the state —  including from Former Speaker Joe Tate, Congresswoman Hillary Scholten, 40 clergy members from across Detroit, the Mayors of Lansing and Grand Rapids, 11 mayors across Metro Detroit, former MI Governor Jim Blanchard, and UNITE Here Local 24,” Oyster said.
Lathrup Village Mayor Kelly Garrett, who previously endorsed Stevens, issued a statement saying Stevens had put in the work for communities of color. 
“Haley is not someone who just shows up for photo opportunities, she rolls up her sleeves and does the actual work,” Garrett said. “Now is not the time for us to tear each other down over distractions that don’t put more money in the pockets of our families. We need to be unified and make Michigan better for ALL Michiganders.”
Also competing with Stevens to gain the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate is state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed and research health specialist Rachel Howard. 
The winner will likely face former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers of White Lake Township, who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump.
Pitchford, meanwhile, told The Detroit News he was in “active communication” with the campaigns for both McMorrow and El-Sayed, both of which he said were seeking his support.

Gavin Newsom’s new mental health court made big promises about how it would help get the sickest Californians off the streets.
Launched in 2023, the program allows people to petition a court to order treatment is for someone experiencing psychosis.
To see how CARE Court is working so far, CalMatters requested data from every county in the state.
Here’s what we found:
CARE Court is reaching far fewer people than expected
The state initially estimated as many as 12,000 Californians could qualify for the program. Instead, just 2,421 petitions have been filed through July, according to the Judicial Council of California. Only 528 of those have resulted in people getting care through voluntary treatment agreements or court-ordered plans. 

San Diego County anticipated receiving 1,000 petitions in the first year and establishing court-ordered treatment plans for 250 people. But in nearly two years, the county instead has received just 384 petitions and established 134 voluntary agreements. Los Angeles County saw 511 petitions filed, with 112 resulting in care agreements or plans. In 2023, LA officials predicted to news organizations the county could enroll 4,500 people in the first year.
It can be hard to file in court
Sources we talked to said it ended up being harder than expected to file petitions. Counties thought police, firefighters and other first responders would jump at the chance to file CARE Court petitions on behalf of the sick, unhoused Californians they encounter on the streets every day. But overworked first-responders didn’t have time to navigate the time-consuming process, said Amber Irvine, San Diego County’s behavioral health program coordinator.
In some cases, police and firefighters filed petitions when the program first started. But they were often dismissed – which made them reluctant to file more, said Crystal Robbins, who manages a treatment referral program for San Diego Fire-Rescue.

“We quickly found out that it wasn’t a useful tool for the people that we see,” she said.
A lot of CARE Court petitions get dismissed
About 45% of petitions filed statewide, although that number includes the handful of cases in which someone has successfully “graduated” from the program. The rate is even higher in some counties, such as San Francisco, where nearly two-thirds of petitions are thrown out. 

That can be for a variety of reasons. Someone might not meet the narrow criteria to qualify for CARE Court. If the person is homeless, outreach workers might have a hard time finding them. Or, the person might simply refuse services. If that’s the case, CARE Court has few teeth to force them to comply. 
Most counties aren’t forcing people to participate
The initial allure of CARE Court for many supporters was the promise of court-ordered treatment plans that would encourage sick people to accept the help they’d been resisting. But most counties are eschewing that aspect of the program, and instead providing treatment only if outreach workers can convince someone to comply. Courts have ordered just 14 people into treatment plans, according to the Judicial Council. 
But counties say numbers don’t tell the whole story
While this data shows how many people engaged in treatment through the official CARE Court program, it doesn’t count all the people who started the process and ended up getting services through another county program instead, said Michelle Doty Cabrera, executive director of the California Behavioral Health Directors Association. 

“I would say that I think the whole idea of looking at the numbers, it sort of misses the point,” she said.
One of CARE Court’s successes, she said, has been in spreading the word about county services to people who might need them. As of December, people were diverted away from CARE Court and into other county services 1,358 times, according to a recent report from the Health and Human Services Agency.
A new bill could boost Care Court’s numbers
Right now, only people with schizophrenia and other limited psychotic disorders qualify. If Sen. Thomas Umberg’s Senate Bill 27 passes, the program would expand to include people who experience psychotic symptoms as a result of bipolar disorder. 

It’s unclear how many more people CARE Court could reach as a result. Umberg’s office has no estimate, and San Diego County says the bill could increase its numbers by anywhere from 3.5% to 48.1%. 
That’s worrying for people like Irvine. Adding a lot more people into the program would give clinicians less time to spend with each client, Irvine said. And Umberg’s bill doesn’t come with money to hire more staff.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/101223-Gavin-Newsom-CARE-Court-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-03 08:59:18.162113
,California,2025-09-03 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,"This rural hospital almost closed. Emergency state funding is keeping it open, but for how long?",Deborah Brennan,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/09/blythe-hospital-possible-closure/,The closure of rural hospitals is a looming problem across all of California. Two Inland Empire lawmakers are urging state officials to take action to save a hospital in Blythe.,"In summary
The closure of rural hospitals is a looming problem across all of California. Two Inland Empire lawmakers are urging state officials to take action to save a hospital in Blythe.


Last spring, Palo Verde Hospital in Blythe was on the brink of closure, after a series of financial mishaps left it bleeding cash.
In May, the hospital announced that it would not accept new patients, “for the foreseeable future,” although its emergency room and clinic remained open, the Riverside Record reported.
READ MORE: Back to the future: Will this California prison become a luxury hotel again?
But emergency state funding announced this summer will help the rural hospital stay open, according to state Sen. Steve Padilla, a San Diego Democrat, whose district includes parts of the Inland Empire.
“In a time (when) our rural hospitals are facing financial hardship and potential closure, it is critical that the state step in to ensure all Californians have access to life-saving care,” Padilla said in a statement. “These hospitals are often the only source of healthcare for an entire community. Palo Verde Hospital is the only acute-care facility within a 100-mile radius, approximately a two-hour drive away – too far in case of an emergency.”
As Palo Verde Hospital had suspended admitting new patients in May, Rep. Raul Ruiz, a Palm Desert Democrat, called on Gov. Gavin Newsom to allocate $4 million in the state budget to keep Palo Verde Hospital afloat, the Desert Sun reported.
He called the looming closure a public health emergency that “puts lives at risk and would leave a massive health care gap in one of the most underserved regions of our state.”
State agencies stepped in, but didn’t provide as much as Ruiz requested. The state Department of Health Care Services expedited $560,000 in Medi-Cal payments to Palo Verde Hospital “to support hospital operations and protect access to care for the community,” the California Health and Human Services Agency told CalMatters in an email.
Last year the Department of Health Care Access and Information awarded the facility $8.5 million through the Distressed Hospital Loan Program, but there are no more funds available through that program. As a recipient of that aid, the hospital had to submit a turn-around plan that detailed how it would use these funds to stay solvent in the long run.
The hospital will also get an extension on repayment of state loans, enabling it to put that money to patient care instead of debt service, Padilla’s office told CalMatters.
El Centro Regional Medical Center in Imperial County, another desert facility in dire financial straits, received $28 million through the Distressed Hospital Loan Program last year and also recently got debt relief on that loan, state officials said. In July the El Centro City Council approved the sale of that facility to a bigger system, Imperial Valley Healthcare District, the Calexico Chronicle reported.
Palo Verde Hospital serves Blythe’s 18,317 residents, 2,600 inmates at Ironwood State Prison and thousands more in the region, Ruiz stated in a letter to Newsom. Without it, the closest medical care would be about two hours away at JFK Memorial Hospital in Indio and Colorado River Medical Center in Needles.
Ruiz said the hospital had faced a cascade of problems including litigation, operating system replacements, and a cyber-attack, which left the hospital with negative cash flow of about a $1 million per month.
The closure of Chuckawalla Valley State Prison in 2024 led to declining population in the city, and low Medi-Cal and insurance reimbursement rates also led to the hospital’s financial crisis, according to the Riverside Record.
It’s not alone. California’s rural hospitals have always operated on a thin margin, and several are on the brink of closure this year, Capitol & Main reported in June, adding that “California’s rural health care system has been financially precarious for years.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090225-El-Centro-Hospital-GB-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-03 08:59:18.162113

Several websites in the state of Nevada remain down as the state struggles to recover from the attack, including an online portal that allows Nevadans to apply for medical and nutrition assistance.
Nevada Access – which state residents use to apply for Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) – remains down, but in-person services have resumed, providing some relief.
State officials said payments for existing SNAP and TANF customers have not been affected, and clients can expect benefits to arrive in their accounts without delay. 
New customers or those who need to renew their benefits will need to complete a paper benefit application and submit it to a Division of Social Services office in person. 
Nevada residents who were in the process of applying or renewing benefits for SNAP and TANF when the cyberattack took place, should not be impacted by the disruption in services. Those applications will be processed as normal. 
A list of open state offices that can accept applications can be found here. 
Paper applications can be found at the state district offices across the state, where caseworkers are available during business hours to assist individuals in person if they need help in completing a Medicaid, SNAP, or TANF eligibility application.
Nevada residents who need additional assistance for Medicaid, SNAP and TANF can call a dedicated number with concerns: In Southern Nevada, 702-486-1646; in Northern Nevada: 775-684-7200 
State officials said they don’t have a projected timeline for when normal operations in the state will be fully restored, but are prioritizing public-facing and critical services.
Residents can follow updates on the restoration of state government services on a dedicated website hosted by the Nevada Office of Emergency Management. The website will provide Nevadans with daily “service status” updates and functioning contact information for state agencies and departments.

(Official White House Photo by Joyce N. Boghosian)Public health and access to lifesaving vaccines are on the line in a high-stakes leadership battle at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s push to fire CDC director Susan Monarez is more than an administrative shake-up. The firing marks a major offensive by Kennedy to seize control of the agency and impose an anti-vaccine, anti-science agenda that will have profound effects on the lives and health of all Americans, public health leaders say.
Kennedy wants to see the Pfizer and Moderna messenger RNA-based covid-19 vaccines pulled from the market, according to two people familiar with the planning who asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak to the press. He’s also set his sights on restricting or halting access to some pediatric immunizations, some public health leaders say.
His actions have already reduced federal help to states, creating the potential for more infectious disease outbreaks and incidences of foodborne illness. Some public health leaders say they expect Kennedy will use the CDC to publicize health information that isn’t grounded in science.
“It’s crazy season,” said Richard Besser, former acting CDC director during the Obama administration. “People want information they can trust to make critical decisions about their health. Until now, we’ve been able to say look at the CDC. Unfortunately, we’re not able to do that anymore.”
HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard disputed the criticism.
“Secretary Kennedy remains firmly committed to delivering on President Trump’s promise to Make America Healthy Again, dismantling the failed status quo that fueled a nationwide chronic disease epidemic and eroded public trust in our public health institutions,” Hilliard said in a statement.
White House spokesperson Kush Desai said Kennedy and Commissioner of Food and Drugs Marty Makary have reiterated that covid shots will remain available for Americans who need and want them.
“The Trump administration is restoring Gold Standard Science as the sole guiding principle of health decision-making,” Desai said in an email. “Only the Fake News could ignore these facts to continue pushing Democrat talking points and hysteria.”
Behind the Ouster
The shake-up began last week, when Kennedy sought to fire Monarez, a microbiologist who’d just been confirmed by the Senate in July. She refused to leave the position, and her lawyers said Kennedy sought to oust her because she wouldn’t fire senior staff or follow unscientific directives. Four top career officials at the CDC resigned on Aug. 27 in protest.
Career staffers at the CDC and some public health groups had hoped President Donald Trump would intervene and put the brakes on Kennedy. Instead, the White House backed Kennedy, saying Monarez was fired.
Trump on Sept. 1 demanded that drug companies show that covid vaccines work, in a further sign he’s not set on defending the shots.
“I hope OPERATION WARP SPEED was as ‘BRILLIANT’ as many say it was. If not, we all want to know about it, and why???” Trump said on Truth Social.
Operation Warp Speed was the initiative that Trump himself announced in 2020 to accelerate the development of covid vaccines, including the Pfizer and Moderna shots. The vaccines have proved safe and effective in multiple clinical trials; a study published in JAMA Health Forum estimated that they saved about 2.5 million lives worldwide.
CDC staffers are worried the agency’s next director won’t fight for science, according to an employee who asked not to be identified for fear of professional retaliation.
Trump’s support for Monarez’s ouster was a watershed moment that signaled there are no checks on Kennedy and his agenda, public health advocates say. Leading congressional Democrats such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for Kennedy’s firing. Hundreds of HHS staffers have also implored Congress to intervene, saying Kennedy threatens science and public health. He is slated to testify Sept. 4 before the Senate Finance Committee.
Kennedy said in a message to CDC staff that his focus is on boosting the agency’s reputation and leadership. The Atlanta-based agency was already reeling after the Trump administration pushed out thousands of its staff and a gunman who reportedly believed the covid vaccine had caused him health problems fired hundreds of rounds at its campus last month, killing a police officer.
“The CDC must once again be the world’s leader in communicable disease prevention. Together, we will restore trust,” Kennedy wrote. “Together, we will rebuild this institution into what it was always meant to be: a guardian of America’s health and security.” He said his deputy, Jim O’Neill, would serve as acting CDC director.
Nine former CDC directors or acting directors who served under both Republicans and Democrats criticized Kennedy in the aftermath of the Monarez firing, saying in an op-ed in The New York Times that the impact on public health is “unacceptable, and it should alarm every American, regardless of political leanings.”
HHS spokesperson Hilliard took exception with this point, listing four covid vaccines that continue to get the nod for use.
However, the Food and Drug Administration last
week approved updated covid mRNA boosters only for people 65 or older and others at high risk of complications. The CDC has also stopped recommending the shots for healthy children and pregnant women. Previously, the shots had been advised for anyone 6 months or older.
As a result, many people who don’t meet the criteria but want the vaccine will have to get prescriptions or consult with their doctors. Insurance may not always cover the shots, which can run around $200. Major drugstores such as Walgreens and CVS have said the shots may not be available at all pharmacies and may require a prescription.
The American Academy of Pediatrics on Aug. 19 broke with the administration, recommending that all young children get the covid vaccine. Insurance still may not cover the cost in some cases and parents could face obstacles in getting the vaccines without a prescription.
Next Move: The Advisory Committee
Kennedy and his team changed official covid vaccine recommendations even though there have been no new safety issues. A dose of the 2023-24 covid mRNA vaccine prevented significant illness and death across all age groups, according to a study published in August led by a University of Michigan researcher. The virus killed about 1,000 people a week in the U.S. in mid-January, and cases are rising again and expected to accelerate this winter.
Kennedy has handpicked a vaccine advisory committee for the CDC that is reviewing mRNA-based covid vaccines, which he falsely claimed in 2021 were “the deadliest vaccine ever made.” The covid vaccine review is being led by Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has said without evidence that the shots cause serious harm, including death. If the committee recommends against them, Kennedy and the FDA could then begin the process of removing them from the market.
Taking mRNA-based covid shots off the market would leave consumers with fewer options for protection. Paxlovid, an antiviral medication that treats the infection in high-risk adults, would be available.
The CDC advisory committee reviewing the covid shots is also probing a long-debunked link between aluminum, used in many childhood immunizations such as those for hepatitis A and pneumonia, and autism or allergies.
The group’s findings are expected to support the erroneous link, some public health officials say. HHS could then require drugmakers to undertake costly reformulations of the shots or stop manufacturing them altogether.
“That would set up the elimination of all childhood vaccines,” Besser said.
The advisory group’s next meeting is set for Sept. 18, although Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) has called for the meeting to be indefinitely delayed. Cassidy, a physician who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, voted for Kennedy’s confirmation as HHS secretary after receiving assurances, he said, that the longtime vaccine opponent wouldn’t disrupt the U.S. vaccination system. Kennedy’s promises, Cassidy said, included that he wouldn’t change the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
Kennedy removed all of the panel’s members in June and replaced them with his own appointees, including anti-vaccine activists.
Kennedy’s move to put his stamp on the CDC means states that have long relied on the agency’s expertise and help in crises such as disease outbreaks will largely be left to fend for themselves, said Ashish Jha, who served as President Joe Biden’s covid response coordinator from 2022 to 2023.
“States are going to be left on their own,” Jha said. “States will struggle with the CDC incapable and dysfunctional. Our system is not designed for states to go it alone.”
The CDC typically plays a critical role by assisting states with disease surveillance, public health interventions, and outbreak response, especially when a crisis spills across state lines. An outbreak of measles this year led to more than 1,400 cases nationwide, and states including Texas, where the outbreak was identified, struggled to get help from the CDC.
A CDC program that has long tracked pathogens in food has already reduced the number of hazards it looks for from eight to two, which public health leaders say is making it harder to identify outbreaks. Staff overseeing a CDC program that tracks outdoor pollution that can exacerbate asthma also have been cut.
The agency runs a hotline that doctors around the country can call to get treatment and other types of advice. Under Kennedy’s watch, the CDC has had to pare assistance because of staffing reductions, said Wendy Armstrong, vice president at the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
“Lives are 100% at stake, no question about it,” Armstrong said. “That you can no longer trust the recommendations out of the CDC is just devastating. It’s appalling to think we can’t trust that information is science-based anymore.”
Kennedy wants to shake up CDC leadership because he sees the agency as the heart of corruption and resistance within the federal health bureaucracy, according to people familiar with his planning. Kennedy has said the agency suffers from malaise and bias.
Many public health leaders, however, view the CDC as under siege by an administration they say is corrupting science for its own ends. HHS staffers signed onto a letter that now has more than 6,800 signatures, saying Kennedy is “endangering the nation’s health by repeatedly spreading inaccurate health information.”
Kennedy has also been fending off mounting criticism of his response to the shooting at the CDC’s headquarters. He responded to the attack on social media, hours later, after first posting pictures of himself fly-fishing.
Some younger staffers are considering leaving and some workers feel like the shooting accelerated Kennedy’s overhaul of the agency, the CDC employee said.
With the battle for control of the CDC still raging, public health leaders are now looking to Congress to put the brakes on Kennedy. Some Republican lawmakers have called for a review of Kennedy’s actions.
“These high profile departures will require oversight by the HELP Committee,” Cassidy said Aug. 27 on the social platform X. Cassidy had backed Monarez to lead the agency.

Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, taking control of the agency in February, the usual process for issuing guidance on the vaccine has been upended, leading to a split between leading health authorities, and a potential gap in vaccine availability for children, who are among the most at risk for severe illness, hospitalization and complications from the disease. 
“I really don’t fully understand it. I’ll be real honest with you, and I’m not sure most physicians who understand the data can make sense of it either, right? There doesn’t seem to be a good reason for restricting the vaccine to only those with underlying health conditions under the age of 65,”  Dr. Molly O’Shea, a pediatrician in Bloomfield Township and a member of the teaching faculty for the residency program at the Children’s Hospital of Michigan told the Michigan Advance in a Tuesday interview.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
For members of the medical community, suddenly shifting from widespread availability to dialing back access is not something that makes sense for the FDA, O’Shea said, as there has not been a shift in complications from the vaccines or issues with the vaccine’s effectiveness to drive that change. 
Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control no longer recommends COVID-19 vaccination for children ranging from 6 months to 17 years of age. 
However the American Academy of Pediatrics has offered its own guidance, recommending all children 6 to 23 months old receive the vaccine, and for children 2 to 18 years old at high risk, or whose parents desire to protect their children from the illness. 
Vaccines are the safest and most effective way for our immune system to learn how to respond to a virus, O’Shea explained.
Additionally, having the vaccine as your baseline exposure to COVID-19 comes with some safety from complications from the illness including multi-inflammatory system response, Long COVID and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, O’Shea said. 
“For all of those reasons, it matters for young children to have access to the vaccine while they’re still kind of freshly unaware that COVID exists,” O’Shea said. 
By reducing access to the vaccine, O’Shea said this promotes a mindset for families – particularly families who were already somewhat less inclined towards vaccination – that the COVID-19 vaccine isn’t of value. 
There’s also been a lot of conversation on how physicians and other healthcare providers can give permission for individuals who want to receive the vaccine outside of the current recommendations, also referred to as off-label use, either in office or through a pharmacy. 
“I really think that’s a very nuanced and challenging issue, because in any other circumstance in which we’re writing something off label, for off label use, it isn’t a scenario in which the data has not been assessed by the FDA,” O’Shea said.

O’Shea also pointed to liability concerns if a vaccine is prescribed for off-label use and a patient has an adverse reaction.
According to a publication from the American Academy of Pediatrics, clinicians prescribing the vaccine could have two layers of protection, stemming from malpractice insurance and the PREP Act, which provides broad immunity from state and federal liability. 
However immunity under the PREP Act is not guaranteed, with the academy encouraging physicians to check their malpractice coverage to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are not excluded. 
“The goal of this whole thing is to scare people out of giving vaccines,” O’Shea said. 
When looking for a list of underlying conditions to qualify for the vaccine, O’Shea pointed to an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which lays out which conditions qualify, including conditions like asthma, diabetes, cerebrovascular disorder, chronic kidney disease, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, heart conditions, certain mental health disorders and more. 
Asked for advice for Michigan parents who want to make sure their children are protected in light of the FDA’s restricted access to the COVID-19, O’Shea offered two recommendations. 
The first, if parents are uncertain their otherwise healthy child will be able to receive the COVID vaccine, is to go to their local health department. 
“[The health department has] made it clear that they’re not going to turn anybody away who wants to receive COVID vaccine. So that’s encouraging,” O’Shea said. 
The second: “Please contact your legislators, both in the House and in the Senate,” O’Shea said. With Kennedy set to testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Sept. 4, O’Shea said the more legislators hear from real people, the better.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/COVID-vaccine.jpg,,,2025-09-03 08:59:18.162113

Gavin Newsom and his fellow Democrats in the Legislature incessantly denounce President Donald Trump for trampling on civil rights in his lust for power. 
Their current drive to sanction a gerrymander of California’s 52 congressional districts to add five Democratic seats is couched in assertions that it would help blunt Trump’s authoritarian tendencies. One pro-Proposition 50 ad describes Trump’s campaign for pro-Republican gerrymanders as a “blitzkrieg,” using language associated with Hitler and World War II Germany.
However, as Newsom, et al, posture as saviors of democracy, they haven’t hesitated to infringe on constitutional rights themselves.
For instance, California’s restrictive laws governing gun ownership have drawn adverse decisions from federal judges in recent months who have applied U.S. Supreme Court interpretations of the constitutional right to bear arms. In the past, Newsom denounced judges who ruled against them as toadies of the firearms industry.
California’s willingness to abridge constitutional rights extends beyond guns, however. Newsom and legislators also will challenge constitutionally protected free speech if it comes from those on the other side of the political divide.
Last year, in response to some political parodies that used images created by artificial intelligence, including one that pilloried Vice President Kamala Harris, the Legislature passed and Newsom signed two measures to outlaw such tomfoolery.
One, Assembly Bill 2655, dubbed the Defending Democracy from Deepfake Deception Act, ordered social media platforms to block or label fictional AI-generated material. Babylon Bee, which generates right-wing satire, and X, Elon Musk’s social media site, filed suit to overturn the law. A month ago, federal Judge John Mendez struck it down for violating the federal Communications Decency Act, which provides immunity to platforms for posting by third parties.
Mendez bypassed the plaintiffs’ contention that the measure unconstitutionally abridged free speech rights. However, he indicated that the second measure, Assembly Bill 2839, did violate the Constitution. Last week, Mendez took that a step further, declaring that by prohibiting deepfake material within 120 days of an election, AB 2839 restricted free speech.
“To be sure, deepfakes and artificially manipulated media arguably pose significant risks to electoral integrity, but the challenges launched by digital content on a global scale cannot be quashed through censorship or legislative fiat,” Mendez wrote, adding, “Just as the government may not dictate the canon of comedy, California cannot preemptively sterilize political content.”
The judge also noted that the state Constitution protects speech so “it follows that AB 2839 violates California’s Constitution for all of the same reasons that it violates the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.”
Despite having the two bills shot down by court, California’s politicians seem bent on once again trying to influence what Californians can be told via social media and the Internet.
Senate Bill 771, which is awaiting action during the final days of the 2025 session, would increase civil penalties that can be imposed on media platforms for content that violates laws barring threats or intimidation.
It stems from the often bitter debate over Israel’s invasion of Gaza in the wake of a deadly Hamas attack on Israel two years ago. The bill is mainly sponsored by pro-Israel groups who say it’s needed to block antisemitic threats. However, groups such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations argue that opening up potential financial penalties would encourage platforms to reduce or eliminate criticism of the war.
An Assembly Judiciary Committee analysis suggested that if SB 771 is enacted it might run afoul of the federal law protecting media platforms from liability for third-party content — the same law cited by Mendez in his decision on the state deepfake law.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/083022-Social-Media-iPhone-IS-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-03 08:59:18.162113

The policy violates medical ethics, erodes humanitarian values, and threatens the Nevada healthcare system by limiting access to care in vulnerable communities. 
Medical professionals must provide care to all, regardless of their status.  A mandate to verify immigration status forces Nevada clinics, like those in Clark and Washoe Counties serving more than 200,000 low-income and uninsured residents annually, to prioritize bureaucracy over patient care. No one is currently being denied services, according to the Southern Nevada Health District, but ongoing lawsuits create uncertainty, threatening care for thousands across Nevada. 
PRWORA, designed to reduce federal spending, now restricts essential Nevada services, aligning with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA), which attempts to ban Medicaid payments to nonprofits like Planned Parenthood. Although a federal court blocked this, for now, Planned Parenthood Mar Monte, serving 320,000 Nevadans, is reducing family medicine, prenatal care, and behavioral health services due to the anticipated loss of approximately $100 million in Medicaid reimbursements. 
Medicaid covers approximately 800,000 Nevadans, including 312,000 through expansion authorized under the Affordable Care Act. Curtailing Medicaid eligibility, the OBBA requires 80 hours of monthly work for adults under 65, with exemptions for parents of children under 14. The health research organization KFF estimates as many as 112,000 Nevadans, particularly in rural counties, could lose coverage due to administrative barriers. 
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), providing $170 million annually to Nevadans, requires work for adults under 65, with exemptions for those with children under 10. These rules, scheduled to take effect next year, risk removing benefits from 20,000 Nevadans, threatening food security and worsening health outcomes like diabetes due to poor nutrition. 
Immigration policies further intensify barriers for Nevada communities. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocates $46.5 billion to Customs and Border Patrol and $29.9 billion to ICE, fueling mass detention and deportation. Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo’s 2025 expansion of 287(g) programs enables local police ICE collaboration in counties like Washoe, which deters people from seeking care. When workers avoid clinics for fear of deportation, it increases risks of untreated conditions which burdens Nevada public health systems.
Verifying immigration status and enforcing work requirements increase administrative costs. Reduced preventive care drives emergency room visits, straining rural hospitals where facilities face closure risks due to Medicaid cuts. An Urban Institute study estimates a $1.5 billion national healthcare cost increase from coverage losses, with Nevada facing disproportionate impacts. 
Clinic restrictions, Medicaid and SNAP cuts, and immigration enforcement deny care, increase fear, and worsen public health risks like untreated diseases in Nevada. These policies destabilize healthcare and burden local employers with $30 million in annual absenteeism costs due to preventable illnesses. This is not efficiency but deliberate exclusion, causing real harm to Nevada communities when policies rooted in care and dignity are most needed.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1417341332-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-03 08:59:18.162113

Othni Lathram, secretary of the Legislative Council, told lawmakers at budget hearings last week said staff would move into the new building in time for the 2026 midterm elections. Legislators would hold their first session in the new Statehouse a few months later. 
The new building will have 11 committee rooms: one joint committee room that will hold up to 200 members of the public; one large and medium committee rooms for each chamber that will hold 150 and 100 members of the public, respectively; and six small committee rooms that will hold 75.

Work on the new statehouse, the first of its kind built in the United States since 1977, began in 2023. It will replace the current Statehouse, first occupied in 1986 and intended as a temporary location while renovations to the Alabama State Capitol took place. A longer-than-expected renovation time in the Capitol and lawmakers’ desire for the additional space the new location provided made the move effectively permanent.
But the structure has numerous problems, including mold issues and hundreds of millions of dollars in deferred maintenance. Building a new statehouse rather than renovating the current one, Lathram said, would not have been cost efficient.
“There would have been no practical improvements. It would have been just getting core functions up to date after years and years of neglect,” Lathram told lawmakers last week.
The Legislature last spring authorized the Legislative Council to find a contractor to demolish the current Statehouse after lawmakers and staff move out in 2027. The area where the building sits is expected to be turned into green space. 
Lathram said the new statehouse, estimated to cost $400 million, is projected to be under budget. The Legislature has appropriated $155 million for the project up front through the state budgets and supplemental appropriations. The goal, Lathram said, is to get $70 million appropriated through the Legislature in the fiscal year 2027 budgets and finance the remaining $175 million.
“We have not grown government during, at least going into three cycles of inflated budgets and additional revenue,” said Rep. Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville. “I think we’ll look back to see this was a huge  manner in which we’re going to reduce our debt service on this building by putting that much cash in there.”
Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, who chairs the Senate Finance and Taxation General Fund Committee, said the remaining appropriations would have to be split between the Education Trust Fund and General Fund. He was also worried about doubled routine costs that would overlap between the demolition of the current State House and the new build.
“As I understand it then, we have our obligation that we need to confront coming up in January is going to be looking at another $75 million split between the ETF and General Fund,” Albritton said. “And we’ve got to look at putting a new line in the budget, basically, for the operation of the upcoming building so that when we get in we’ll have the money to function there.”
The $35 million parking deck, which is included in the $400 million budget, will include spots for all lawmakers and staff, as well as 100 spaces for the public, Lathram said. Schools often visit the State House for tours, leaving school buses on the road. To remedy the congestion, there will be a spot for buses to park out of the way where the current State House lies.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Alabama-Statehouse-Sept-2-2025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-03 08:59:18.162113

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Babies and children in the United States are nearly twice as likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with their peers in other wealthy countries, according to a new study.
The health of U.S. children has deteriorated since the early 2000s across a range of measures, researchers from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California, Los Angeles found. They published their findings last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.
U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.
For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.
Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy  countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.
To improve infant and child health, the authors of the op-ed proposed antipoverty measures such as child tax credits; social media restrictions; broader health insurance coverage; more investment in primary care; and more restrictive firearm laws.

(via Rep. Chellie Pingree) Victims of the Lewiston mass shooting filed a lawsuit against the United States for negligence in failing to respond to warning signs and an explicit threat to commit a mass shooting, their attorneys announced Wednesday. 
The official lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine comes after the four law firms jointly representing 100 clients, survivors and family members, sent a legal notice to the federal government last year indicating their plan to sue. 
That notice, known as a Standard Form 95, gave the federal government six months to administratively adjudicate the claim before they could institute a civil action. The federal government has not responded in the now-10 months since the notice, according to the attorneys. 
“If the Army does not accept accountability here, where it knew its soldier had severe mental illness, had access to weapons and was warned in advance that he planned to commit a mass shooting, then it’s hard to imagine the Army ever accepting accountability without being forced to do so in court,” Attorney Benjamin Gideon of Gideon Asen said in a statement.
The lawsuit points to many of the findings of state and Army investigations, which concluded multi-agency failures related to the handling of Robert Card II’s deteriorating mental health in the months before he killed 18 people and injured 13 others in Lewiston on Oct. 25, 2023. 
Broadly, the lawsuit alleges that the Army’s knowledge of service member mass violence made the risks posed by Card foreseeable, including that his exposure to blast forces from his service likely contributed to his mental illness, increasing the risk he’d decline without treatment and pose a danger to himself and the community. 
But it also claims the Army failed to act when it became aware of Card’s deteriorating mental health and erratic behavior.
The lawsuit alleges the Army violated its own policies, specifically breaching its obligations to communicate warnings about Card to the highest levels of Army Reserve command and law enforcement, maintain ongoing jurisdiction over him until formally adjudicating his mental and physical status, and use available processes to make sure he couldn’t access firearms, including the AR-10 assault rifle he used to carry out the mass shooting.
The Army’s inaction “cost us everything,” said Cynthia Young, whose husband William and 14-year-old son Aaron died in the shooting. Young added, “No family should have to endure this heartbreak when so many warning signs were ignored.”
Attorney Travis Brennan of Berman & Simmons asked, “Without accountability what hope can we have of preventing this kind of tragedy from repeating itself?”
In addition to Gideon Asen and Berman & Simmons, two Maine-based firms, the Lewiston shooting victims are backed by two out-of-state firms that have reached settlements for victims of other mass shootings. 
Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder, a Connecticut-based legal group, previously represented victims of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. The firm secured $73 million after suing Remington, the maker of the AR-15 rifle used by the shooter. 
National Trial Law, a Texas-based firm, represented survivors of a 2017 shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs and reached a $230 million settlement with the U.S. Air Force for failing to report the shooter’s history of violence into the FBI database. 
The lawsuit does not focus on accusations about the failings of local law enforcement. Such failings have been detailed by the state commission that investigated the shooting, notably that the Sagadahoc County Sheriff’s Office had sufficient probable cause to both take Card into protective custody under Maine’s yellow flag law and start a petition to confiscate his firearms. 
In November, Maine voters will be asked whether they want the state to adopt a “red flag” law. 
The main difference between these types of laws is that under a “red flag” law, officially called Extreme Risk Protection Order, family members can directly petition a judge to temporarily limit someone’s access to firearms when they are in crisis, whereas current Maine statute only permits law enforcement to do so and requires a mental health evaluation before a judge can confiscate someone’s firearms.

(Danielle P. Richards for New Jersey Monitor)After a post-pandemic spike in the number of students who are regularly missing from school in New Jersey, chronic absenteeism has dropped but remains a bigger problem than it was nearly 10 years ago, state records show.
Data from the state Department of Education shows that the chronic absenteeism rate was 15% for the 2023-24 school year, the last for which the data is available. That means more than 190,000 of the state’s roughly 1.4 million public school students missed 10% or more school days that year, including absences that were excused and unexcused and those related to disciplinary action.
The rate had reached 18% in the 2021-22 school year. For the 2016-17 school year, the figure was 10%.
The data is more alarming when broken out into demographic groups.
More than 21% of Black students statewide were chronically absent in 2023-24, or nearly 40,000 students, and the figure for Hispanic students was about 18%, or roughly 81,000 students. For Asian American students, the chronic absenteeism rate was 7%, and for white students, 11%. All those rates are up from 2016-17.
“This is an issue that takes a village. It’s not just the school’s responsibility, it’s not just the community providers or the student or the parent. It’s a problem that has to be solved with everyone, collaboratively,” said Nina Peckman, an education attorney with research and advocacy group Advocates for Children of New Jersey. 
Aida Rosario is the director of communications at Paterson Public Schools, which teaches about 24,000 students. Rosario said absenteeism rates are significantly higher for certain subgroups because these groups face unique challenges that make consistent school attendance more difficult than for other populations.
In Paterson, 36% of students were chronically absent in 2023-24. For Black students, that figure was 46%, representing about 1,600 students, and for Hispanic students, it was 35%, or about 5,200 students.
“These elevated rates are not due to lack of interest in education, but rather structural and systemic barriers outside students’ control. Addressing them requires targeted supports, wraparound services, and culturally responsive engagement strategies that recognize and respond to these challenges,” Rosario said.
Newark has the state’s largest school district, with a population of roughly 44,000 students and a chronic absenteeism rate of 12% in 2023-24. That’s down from 30% in 2016-17.
For Black students in Newark, the rate was 15% in 2023-24 and for Hispanic students, 10%.
“These encouraging numbers show that our students and families are responding to the district’s efforts to build a culture of daily attendance,” Hasani K. Council, president of the Newark Board of Education, said in a statement. “When students are present, they’re positioned for success. We will continue working to ensure that every child in Newark is supported and empowered to show up, every single day.”
Education advocates say the increase in chronic absenteeism is due to several factors, including student mental health needs and chronic illnesses. Peckman said she helps more than 300 parents a year with chronic absenteeism issues, which is an uptick from before the pandemic led to widespread school closures. 
“Some parents call me when their child has missed 20, 30, 40, or more days of school, and the parents didn’t have any clue on how to advocate for their child to receive instruction or support services,” she said. “And unfortunately, in some cases, the schools aren’t communicating well with the parent regarding what they can do.”
Under state statute, after four cumulative unexcused absences for a student, the school district must reach out to the parents and develop a plan to address the issue. When unexcused absences number between five and nine days, the school should engage the student’s family, consult whether the student’s academic, behavioral, and health needs are being met, and consider an alternative placement if needed. 
Peckman said that typically when parents call her and are already dealing with chronic absenteeism, they say they were not invited to meetings with teachers. Absenteeism policies can be buried deep in a school’s website, and parents aren’t best informed of their children’s rights, she said. 
“When parents contact me, they are struggling to get their children to school, and they’re looking for help. That’s why they call me, because they have tried to get help, but they’re not aware of all the resources that schools can offer or what they could possibly get through the community,” Peckman said.
She also noted that districts are having trouble replacing teachers, social workers, and guidance counselors who have left, leaving staff overburdened.
“It makes sense that if there’s less adults, less staff, less support staff, that there’s less people to notice a child is having an issue or what to make of an attendance issue,” she added.
In 2016, Advocates for Children of New Jersey said in a study that more than 136,00 students statewide were chronically absent, and attributed the causes to similar problems Peckman mentioned. Black students made up about 25% of the state’s chronically absent students then, and Hispanic students made up 32%, according to the report.
Chronic absenteeism is also more likely to affect low-income children and students of color because they are at higher risk for unreliable transportation, unstable housing, school suspensions, and community violence, according to the report, which says New Jersey’s trend follows greater national trends.
In June, state lawmakers passed a bill that would establish a statewide task force aimed at reducing chronic absenteeism in schools. The measure is currently on Gov. Phil Murphy’s desk awaiting a signature or veto.
Bill sponsor Sen. Angela McKnight (D-Hudson) said in a statement that the task force would study the many overlapping challenges facing students who are chronically absent, like food insecurity and housing instability.
“This task force will dig deeper to identify the full range of barriers that prevent students from showing up and staying engaged in school.

After all these years, Republicans finally made their dream a reality: They defunded public media. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is going out of business. Local television and radio stations across the country will die, and many are already cutting back service.
I commend New Jersey’s Democratic Congress members for voting no. Sen. Andy Kim, in particular, released strong statements highlighting beloved PBS programs like Reading Rainbow, Mr. Rogers, and Sesame Street. Would these shows have ever gotten off the ground without crucial seed funding from the federal government and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting?
“These cuts, they’re going to hurt my state,” Kim said.
NJ PBS will lose $1.5 million in federal funds. New Jersey-based radio stations will lose over $590 million.
But Kim should advise the Democrats running New Jersey to undo their own attack on public media.
New Jersey’s Democrat-controlled government just cut state funding for NJ PBS from $1 million to $250,000. My state legislators down here in the 3rd Legislative District — state Sen. John Burzichelli and Assembly members Heather Simmons and Dave Bailey Jr. — denounced proposed “fun taxes” on bowling and gambling, but not “fun cuts” to children’s television and local history.
Instead, Democrats prioritize their regressive Stay NJ program that will finally bring property tax relief to some of our richest residents. But it’s unclear how the next governor, and whichever legislators remain in office after November’s Assembly elections, will cover its full $1.2 billion bill.
For just about 0.6% of Stay NJ’s cost, the state could undo its NJ PBS cuts, bring funding back to its 2010 level (adjusted for inflation), and cover lost federal funds for both NJ PBS and New Jersey-based radio stations. While we’re at it, we may want to undo Chris Christie’s destruction of our public radio network. Or perhaps send funds to WHYY so they can expand programming for South Jersey. Rural areas, after all, are going to get hit the worst when public media fades away.
While we wait for our leaders to get the memo, I encourage all who can afford it to become an NJ PBS member and donate to nonprofit newsrooms. While for-profit media mostly provides us with “a vast wasteland of mediocrity”, public media offers an alternative less beholden to advertisers and investors, punching well above its weight for content quality despite decades of funding constraints — and now funding cuts.

Local Motion works to make it safe, accessible and fun for everyone to bike, walk and roll in Vermont through advocacy and technical assistance. 


On Saturday, Aug. 16, Colchester resident Michael Pickering was killed after being struck by a car on Malletts Bay Avenue. This is a tragedy for everyone involved, and it was entirely avoidable.
That’s because Malletts Bay Avenue is dangerous by design.
The stretch of the road that Michael was killed on was built exclusively for the movement of cars, despite running through a neighborhood where people live, walk dogs, collect mail, garden, exercise and greet their neighbors. It transitions abruptly from a country road into a residential area with no design elements to slow drivers down or alert them to the presence of pedestrians.
It lacks continuous sidewalks and shoulders, forcing anyone walking, biking or rolling into the lane of traffic. It lacks safe crossings. It lacks adequate lighting. The road divides a neighborhood with a high-speed corridor, with no protection for the people who live and move here. 
Without protection, our neighbors are at risk whenever they use this street. There is little margin of error for drivers — any mistake can lead to another tragedy.
Malletts Bay Avenue connects Winooski and Colchester. In 2024, the Winooski Walk/Bike Master Plan identified Malletts Bay Avenue as a top priority for safety improvements. Over the past five years, more than 75 crashes have been reported along this corridor, resulting in more than 15 injuries — and now a death. 
Still, our towns are not making changes we need to make fast enough to save lives. Town officials are not planning to install a sidewalk until 2028 or 2029, according to WCAX.
Two days after Pickering’s death, Strong Towns, a national leader in livable communities, published an article arguing that such tragedies are “statistically inevitable outcomes of building a place where human life outside of a car has no real value in the design.” When tragedies happen, we must have a public conversation that says, “This place killed someone. Here’s why, and here’s how we stop it from happening again.”
Malletts Bay Avenue killed Pickering. If nothing changes, it will happen again.
So, the question now is: How are we going to stop it?
We already know how to prevent tragedies like this. What we need is the public will to make it happen. Join your local walk/bike group and advocate for safer streets in your community.

(Photo by Steven Garcia/Investigate Midwest)CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa – Few people outside Quaker Oats know exactly what the Cedar Rapids factory is making when a sweet, wholesome smell wafts from the plant north of downtown.
Locals call it a Crunch Berry day because Quaker – the world’s largest cereal plant – makes Cap’n Crunch’s Crunch Berries, but the aroma could also be oats roasting for Oatmeal Squares or maple-flavored instant oatmeal.
The oats fueling that sweet-smelling goodness come not from the rich Iowa soil near the plant, but from up to 1,000 miles away in Canada. For decades, the plumpest, most consistent oats came from the northern plains, but new field trials show food-grade oats can be grown in Iowa and Minnesota by farmers eager for an alternative to corn and soybeans.
Buying domestic oats would help Quaker save freight costs and avoid threatened tariffs on Canadian goods. It could also improve Midwest water quality and soil health ravaged by an endless corn/soy rotation. Expanding Midwest oat production offers economic and environmental benefits for farmers and local communities, advocates say.
But agricultural companies and commodity groups don’t have financial incentives tied to oats because oats don’t require hybrid seeds, crop insurance or as much fertilizer. These big players aren’t opposing oats, but they aren’t cheerleading either.
The lack of support has left oat growers to be their own hype machines.
“We can actually pick our varieties and our production practices to provide a better product than Canada, not only on a protein level, but on an environmental impact level,” said Landon Plagge, a Latimer, Iowa, farmer and oat advocate.
In May, Plagge and other oat farmers in Iowa and Minnesota loaded 100,000 bushels of their oats into a rail car bound for Quaker’s factory in Cedar Rapids. Three months later, they’re still waiting to hear what the grain giant thought of the domestic product.
Iowa is a ‘donut hole’ for oat research
Baby boomers who grew up on Iowa farms remember growing oats to feed horses and other livestock. Iowans harvested more than 6 million acres of oats a year until the 1950s, according to Matt Liebman, an emeritus Iowa State University agronomy professor.
But as Americans started eating more meat, demand increased for corn to feed the cattle, hogs and chickens. When ethanol was approved as a fuel additive in the 1970s, corn demand rose again. Now, about 45% of corn nationwide becomes ethanol.
Like kernels around a cob, industries popped up to serve King Corn. Specialty seed breeders, co-ops that sell fertilizer and consultants who tell farmers how much corn to feed their hogs all benefit from expansion of corn acres.
Still, Iowans harvested nearly 40,000 acres of oats for grain in 2022, putting it eighth in the nation behind North Dakota, Minnesota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Texas, Pennsylvania and New York, according to the Census of Agriculture. Oats harvested to feed animals and humans increased 12.6% in Iowa between 2017 and 2022.

 
Iowa State University, a land-grant school with a powerhouse agriculture college, once had a distinguished oat breeding program. Kenneth Frey and J. Artie Browning developed a crown rust-resistant oat cultivar they shared with farmers as certified seed in 1968, according to the Agronomy Department’s 125th Points of Pride.
But Iowa State hasn’t had an oat breeder since 2007 and doesn’t do its own oat trials. The university did partner with Practical Farmers of Iowa, a sustainable agriculture nonprofit based in Des Moines, to hold oat trials at four ISU research farms.
“Iowa is the donut hole,” Liebman said, referring to oat research in neighboring states of Minnesota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Illinois.
Liebman, who retired in 2021, understands university budgets are tight and there’s no corporate constituency clamoring for oat research.
“There’s more money to be made in selling corn and soybeans,” he said, referring to ag companies. “With oats, you don’t have to keep buying seed every year because it’s not hybrid and it’s not transgenic. It’s much less lucrative.”
He’d like to see ISU prioritize research of oats and other small grains because of the benefits to soil health and water quality.
Glen Ritchie, who started as ISU’s Agronomy Department chair in July, said he knows there is renewed interest in oats among Iowa farmers and that might affect research priorities.
“We’re always looking for opportunities to provide the best value we can to the agricultural community in Iowa,” he said. “Oats are part of the discussions we’re having on that.”
He’s seen it happen
Martin Larsen dipped his toe into small-grains farming in 2018, planting oats on a small swath of his farm near Byron, Minnesota. He was curious. Would his combine work for oat harvest? Could he get at least 38 pounds per bushel – the minimum threshold for food-grade oats?
The answers were yes and yes.
“I ramped up from there to the point I have a full three-crop rotation on 1,400 acres,” he said.

Larsen has even invested in specialized equipment, including a header for his combine that strips the seeds from the top of the oat plant rather than running the whole stalk through the machine. This speeds harvest and keeps the stalk in place to reduce erosion.
Other farmers want to know whether Larsen is making money from oats.
“It’s always the thing we hear,” he said. “Soybeans, especially, can see an up to 10% yield bump because you’ve broken up the crop rotation.”
Glyphosate-resistant water hemp vexes every Midwest corn farmer. When the weed wants to make its move in late spring, oats already have a lush green cover and the water hemp can’t compete. That means less weed pressure during the next corn round and less pesticide he has to apply, Larsen said.
By planting red clover with the oats, the clover provides nitrogen to the soil, which feeds future corn crops with reduced fertilizer costs, he said.
“So you really start to put all this together and it’s looking like the right thing for my farm,” he said.
It’s also the right thing for protecting water quality, said Larsen, who is a conservation and feed lot technician for the Olmsted County Soil and Water Conservation District. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has asked Minnesota to develop a plan for reducing nitrate pollution to groundwater in southeastern Minnesota’s Driftless region.
Nitrate in drinking water not only can cause blue baby syndrome, but studies – including some done in Iowa – show a link between ingesting nitrate from drinking water and cancers including colorectal, thyroid, bladder and ovarian.
“We have to raise something different than corn and soybeans or raise corn and soybeans differently if we’re going to affect nitrates,” Larsen said. “We have hundreds and hundreds of data points of groundwater samples below oats compared to corn and soybeans, and it’s black and white that oats will reduce nitrates in groundwater.”
Tests of groundwater under Larsen’s oat acres show up to 60% less nitrate than under corn acres.
Farmers band together
While running a grocery store in Latimer for eight years, Anne and Landon Plagge were always thinking about what customers wanted to buy.
“We were on vacation in Europe and we saw the proliferation of oat products on the shelves there,” Landon Plagge said. “Our (U.S.) consumer patterns tend to mirror that.”
The global market for oat milk was valued at more than $2 billion in 2020 and is projected to climb through at least 2028, especially with new shelf-stable milk. Beyond oat milk, there is oat flour for people trying to avoid gluten, and oatmeal boosted with flax and chia for people trying to get more protein.
Plagge decided he wanted to grow oats for the segment of the U.S. population that wants an allergen-free, pesticide-free product. Grain Millers processes oats in St. Ansgar, Iowa, near the Minnesota border, but they grind wheat and barley, too, so the oats can’t be completely free of allergens, Plagge said.

He recruited about 70 farmers, mostly from Iowa and Minnesota, to invest in Green Acres Milling, a $55 million oat-processing plant in Albert Lea, Minnesota. The plant, scheduled to open next year, eventually will process 3 million bushels of oats a year. This equates to about 60,000 acres of oats within three years, Plagge said.
“They put their own cash into making the mill a reality,” Plagge said of the investors – including Larsen – who will get a premium price for the oats they sell to Green Acres. The mill requires oat growers to use a cover crop and to grow oats as part of a rotation with other crops.
“That gives us the control of the raw materials supply coming in so we can provide a sustainably-produced oat with a cover crop for our brands and a diverse rotation for our brands,” Plagge said.
Who’s buying?
While Quaker is several generations removed from its 1870’s origin in Ravenna, Ohio, Seven Sundays founders Hannah and Brady Barnstable sold their first bag of muesli – like granola, but healthier – at a Minneapolis farmers market in 2011.
“We love oats,” Brady Barnstable said. “We think they are a huge unlock to change the agricultural landscape in the Midwest.”
Seven Sundays makes cereal and granola without dyes, artificial colors, allergens or refined sugars. They also buy only non-GMO crops grown without glyphosate. Their products, like Wildberry Protein Oats, have muscled their way onto grocery shelves, including at Midwest Costco stores.
“We’ve been invited to the Costco Midwest managers meetings in the Chicago area to give presentations on what we’re doing in our supply chain to benefit soil health,” Barnstable said. But Costco wouldn’t stock Seven Sundays just for environmental brownie points, he said. “The decisions are driven by sales. Is it resonating with their shoppers? For Seven Sundays, it is.”
Seven Sundays originally bought all its oats from Whole Grain Milling, in Welcome, Minnesota, but as they sold more muesli and cereal, Seven Sundays needed more suppliers, including some from Canada. By purchasing American oats, the company could avoid increased freight costs and skip tariff fears.
“Our goal is to source as close to home as possible for all our ingredients,” Barnstable said. “I have heard that this new mill will have the capacity to provide us and many other customers with the oats we need to fill our full demand.”
Public push for sustainable products
But what about Quaker? The company and its parent, PepsiCo Inc., did not respond to several attempts to seek comment for this story. Just like Quaker doesn’t advertise what makes that sweet smell in Cedar Rapids, the firm isn’t saying exactly what factors into their oat sourcing.
But we know price and availability of supplies are key drivers, according to PepsiCo’s 2024 Annual Report.
“Risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers,” the report stated.
Companies face pressure from consumers – particularly Millennials and Gen Z – who increasingly want to buy products that are good for people and the planet. A 2024 survey by PwC showed consumers are willing to spend almost 10% more for sustainably-sourced or produced goods.
PepsiCo and Cargill announced in July they will partner with Practical Farmers of Iowa to advance regenerative farming practices across 240,000 acres in Iowa. Farmers who sell their corn to Cargill – which produces ingredients for PepsiCo’s family of companies – will have access to advice, technical resources and incentive payments to “support their transition to regenerative practices,” the companies said in a joint news release.
Cargill and PepsiCo want to drive adoption of regenerative practices on 10 million acres by 2030, the news release said.
News like this brings equal parts frustration and hope for Larsen, the Minnesota oat farmer waiting to hear back from Quaker about the May oat shipment. “It seems like buying oats from their backyard would fit their narrative.”

As he navigated downed trees and power lines, turning his 10-minute commute into a three-hour slog, he worried whether his family, neighbors, and home made it through unscathed.
When he turned the corner onto his block, White’s heart sank. The entire back wall of his house had been blown off. Chunks of ceiling plaster littered the floor, windows were shattered, and much of his property was damaged beyond repair.
Next, White checked on his mother, Bobbie, who lives a five-minute walk away. The third floor of her home was gone. But miraculously, her front yard flower garden made it through the 150 mph winds unscathed.

This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.

The St. Louis storm, an EF-3, was just one of 60 tornadoes that tore through Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and the Carolinas over 48 hours in May, killing at least 26 people and injuring 168.
DeAmon and Bobbie considered themselves lucky: A neighbor of theirs had his leg impaled by a pole that flew through his window. Bobbie went to her sister’s house to get some sleep; DeAmon spent the night in his truck, trading shifts with neighbors to fend off looters.
The next morning, at 8 a.m., the phone calls started: Would he be interested in selling his home? “They were aggressively going at it,” he said. This continued for the next two weeks, with half a dozen calls every single day.
They’re “vultures,” Bobbie and DeAmon both called the speculators. Some walked down the street with flyers, some texted, and some called.
In White’s West End neighborhood, an estimated 63 percent of renters and 49 percent of homeowners are uninsured. For many North St. Louis residents, their homes are their only major asset, meaning they don’t have the cash on hand necessary to rebuild without insurance. And when federal aid is slow to arrive, quick offers to buy a home in cash can look like a lifeline.
“Hi, this is Paul with H.B. LLC,” read one text sent to a homeowner just north of the tornado’s path on August 4. “Touching base with you … is this Steven?”
Grist tried contacting several of these numbers, but most were not set up to receive call- or text-backs. One, however, did pick up. A woman, sounding like she was in a call center, asked if there was a property to sell. “We’re a ‘we buy homes’ company,” she said, but repeatedly refused to give Grist the company name.
Eight months earlier and 600 miles away, Gina Miceli’s community in Fairview, North Carolina, was devastated by Hurricane Helene, which triggered hundreds of landslides. The rushing earth swallowed up homes and cars and killed 15 of her neighbors. In the months following, she received near-constant texts asking if she’d be open to selling her family’s two plots of land.
“They text really chummy, so they sound like they already know you,” Miceli said. “‘Hey, Gina, it’s so-and-so!’ It’s very, very creepy.”
“Let me know your price,” said one text on July 9, signed simply, “Bella.”
“Hi there Gina, hope you’re having a great day,” said another exactly two weeks later. “My name is Christine, I am a land buyer. I’m reaching out to see if you have any plans to sell the lot.” The text was signed by “Twin Acres.” Twin Acres is not a registered real estate broker. Grist’s attempt to text the number back went unanswered.
Sometimes, Miceli said, she answers the texts. “It depends on my mood. I think there’s been a time or two I’ve said, ‘Go to hell.’” She has no plans to leave. She’s raising her family in the home her husband’s grandparents bought, and she owns a local brewery.
Some theorists call this phenomenon “disaster gentrification,” when real estate investors flood a disaster zone to buy up damaged properties for cheap.
Samantha Montano, a professor of emergency management and author of the book Disasterology, spent years living and working in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and saw it happen with her own eyes. In areas like the Lower Ninth Ward, some people displaced by the storm didn’t have the resources to return. Speculators rushed in. Some landowners became instant millionaires, selling their properties to out-of-state developers hoping to rebuild and flip their property.
“The issue of gentrification in New Orleans was there from the beginning,” Montano said. “There were many groups who were warning about that, advocating for housing policy and other recovery policies to account for gentrification. [They] tried to prevent it.”
Twenty years later, the demographics of New Orleans have shifted: Lower-income and Black residents have been displaced, and whiter, wealthier new residents took their place. “Certainly that is all very much intertwined in the recovery and in who had access to the resources to return and rebuild — and who didn’t,” she said.
In the wake of the Eaton Fire in Altadena, California, earlier this year, half of home purchases were by limited liability corporations, according to Dwell, the home design news site. That’s nearly double what they typically represent compared to individuals buying homes.
Just six companies — among them Ocean Development Inc. and Black Lion Properties LLC — dominated those transactions in Altadena, spending millions of dollars to purchase destroyed properties in historically Black neighborhoods. It’s difficult to find out who these companies are: Often, they contact potential sellers through fake phone numbers or under names that aren’t necessarily attached to real corporations.
The value of disaster-struck land consistently bounces back fast, meaning that buyers can flip the land or homes — sometimes even without making repairs. As climate change fuels more frequent severe natural disasters across the United States, “disaster investors” seem set to make greater profits than ever — and communities like North St. Louis stand to bear the burden.
Justin Stoler, a University of Miami researcher working on urban health disparities, recently published a paper on hazard gentrification. This phenomenon, Stoler told Grist, diverges from our standard understanding of gentrification in its speed. “It’s typically happening in a very punctuated, short-term manner. It doesn’t necessarily take years and decades to roll out.”
“People’s lives are completely upended, and they’ve got to make difficult choices,” Stoler said. “And opportunistic entities, companies, investors try to step in and get a good deal. You end up with this system where people are exploiting the misfortunes of others.”
In DeAmon White’s neighborhood, he saw the signs of gentrification long before the tornado: A community barbershop replaced by a trendy new restaurant; a former school turned into an upscale apartment building inhabited by law students; and “just a lot of white folks moving into what they used to call ‘the hood,’ you know?”
And investors were already circling. Signs with “WE BUY UGLY HOUSES” could be found on utility poles and in mailboxes before the May storm. These are markers of real estate wholesalers and house-flippers looking for a quick sale. But they increased in frequency and aggressiveness after the neighborhood was turned to rubble, he said.
It’s a little too soon to say whether the St. Louis tornado will lead to big land buys. But signs — and Zillow search results — are pointing in that direction.

At least 10 severely damaged homes in the tornado’s path have gone up for sale on the real estate platform Zillow in recent weeks. Each one is labeled not as a home for locals to move into, but as an investment opportunity: 4641 Maffit Avenue “offers investment potential” for rehab or brick salvage, with a starting bid of $20,000; 4236 East Sacramento Avenue — “Investor Special!! Tornado damaged property” — in the historic Ville neighborhood is going for $30,000.
A hundred days after the storm, many St. Louis neighborhoods remain as damaged as they were the day of the tornado in May. Debris still litters streets and yards, blue tarps still stand in for caved-in roofs, and windows are still boarded up — even as the weather cools. Community activist organizations are providing aid where they can. One group, The People’s Response, which mobilized some 10,000 volunteers, estimates that over 2,000 St. Louis households still require housing and shelter assistance.
But even with a robust volunteer network, $30 million from an NFL settlement redirected toward tornado relief, and FEMA aid (slowly) arriving, homeowners have been left in the lurch for months, facing a difficult decision about how — or even whether — to rebuild.
Deserai Anderson Crow, who researches community resilience at the University of Colorado-Boulder, says what is happening in St. Louis follows a pattern similar to other extreme weather disasters: Those who rebuild are more often than not landlords looking for renters, rather than people who intend to live in the homes they’re rebuilding.
“It’s a predatory renting cycle,” Crow said. “These huge industrial-rental landlords are trying to snap up disaster-affected homes because they assume, correctly, that a lot of people want to get out from under those mortgages as quickly as possible, and that they just don’t have the emotional bandwidth or financial bandwidth to deal with rebuilding.”
Bobbie White’s damaged home was built in 1901, back when St. Louis was a thriving Mississippi River transit hub. One of the industries that built St. Louis was brickmaking, with the materials renowned worldwide for their strength and quality. Bobbie’s home, and others on her block, are made of those bricks. “A lot of these houses are 100-year-old structures,” DeAmon said. What is built in their stead likely won’t be as unique or sturdy, and yet will cost far more, he lamented — prices out of reach for many in the neighborhood today.
Stacey Sanders, president of the St. Louis Association of Realtors, says she’s been inundated with reports of speedy post-disaster sale offers. But they often come with red flags: For one thing, multigenerational homes may not have access to a title, or the title might be in the name of a deceased family member. Sometimes, resolving title issues can take years. 
Many of the storm-impacted multigenerational homes are in that legal category. Those “heirs’ property” homeowners are stuck, Sanders said. Without a title, it can be harder to access FEMA benefits, filing an insurance claim is extremely difficult, and sales without a title are legally dubious at best.
When Sanders’ own home and car were hit by a tornado this March, “we had letters, door hangers, people knocking on the door, doing everything.” They were either selling her on repairs or selling her on a home purchase. She was, as a professional real estate agent, able to access resources and recover her damaged property. But she worries others may have a harder time.
“It might be the easiest and the quickest way,” Sanders said, “ but it’s not always the best way to go. A lot of the people that are out making these offers on houses are not doing it because they’re like, ‘Oh, these poor people, let’s give them a fair shake.'”
Instead, they’re seeing “desperate people” and chasing an opportunity to buy property for far less than it is worth.

There are options to curb this mass sell-off. One tactic, Crow, of the University of Colorado, said, is providing a few months of bridge funding so residents can stay and navigate the rebuilding process.
Another is to stymie buyers: This June, the Ohio Senate passed a bill requiring real estate wholesalers to tell homeowners when they may be selling their homes for less than market value. Pennsylvania passed a similar law in January.
The market in Missouri, however, remains unregulated at both the local and state level, according to attorney Peter Hoffman of Legal Services of Eastern Missouri, a nonprofit that has been providing pro bono services to tornado victims.
“They find people in vulnerable situations that maybe don’t have equal access to information,” Hoffman said. Those issues — redlining, displacement, exploitation — existed before the tornado. But the storm, he said, brought them to the light.
Talking on the phone between orders of fish, fried okra, and potato salad while at his restaurant, Ozell’s Kitchen and Food Mart, DeAmon White reflected on the last few months.
Rebuilding his home has been hard. Though he does have insurance, he expects his home won’t be livable until February or March, the better part of a year after the tornado. Because he’s disabled, with a partially amputated foot, he stays mostly on the first floor of his mother’s house. A neighbor of his is still living in a camper on her lot. Others, he said, took the offer to sell.
Right now, there are only four families left on his block. On Aug. 21, White said, his mother received an offer in the mail: A man named Chris wanted to buy her home for about two-thirds of what it was worth.
“I really would like the people who are in the line of gentrification to realize what it is they have, and if they can, don’t sell out,” White said. “I know money talks, and when you’re in a stressful situation you got to do what you got to do, but resist, you know?”

This can’t happen without reliable numbers collected by government. (Getty Images)As the Purdue University Fort Wayne Community Research Institute director, I rely on public state and federal data, funded by our tax dollars, that provides unique information using past and current conditions. 
Some data can be found nearly immediately like the number of weekly unemployment insurance claimants from the Indiana Department of Workforce Development. Others take almost a year like the county-level gross domestic product from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Furthermore, many data sets are subject to revisions even years later. 
Much of this is produced consistently to see how things have changed over time. Reliable data practices can track how local wages are performing against national averages, how birth rates have changed, or the affordability of rental housing compared to a decade ago.
I consider these numbers trustworthy. I recognize data collection limitations and data suppression to protect privacy, which is frustrating but understood.
President Donald Trump’s decision to fire U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after the BLS revised the May and June jobs numbers is somewhere between disheartening and alarming. After decades of “what gets measured gets managed,” terminating an employee based on what appears to be appropriate data revisions puts reliability of apolitical information at risk. 
Here are examples of local data available from state or federal agencies that I have used over the years:

Number of cancer cases from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Percentage of the county’s gross domestic product attributed to manufacturing from the BEA
Number of fatal traffic crashes from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
Number of workers who are not currently employed but actively looking for a job from the IDWD
Percentage of low birthweight and premature infants from the Indiana Department of Health
Annual population change attributed to births and deaths from the U.S. Census Bureau
Number of workers commuting between counties from the Indiana Department of Revenue
Share of renters who are considered housing burdened from the Census Bureau
Price changes of groceries, gasoline, clothing, rent and other consumer goods and services from the BLS
Number of bachelor’s degrees awarded from the National Center for Education Statistics
Average monthly SNAP benefits from the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration
Percentage of recent high school graduates going to college from the Indiana Commission on Higher Education

Available data are far from complete, yet this list represents a state and federal commitment to information in many disciplines to provide robust statistics. 
Decisions have been made on what data points to collect and perhaps on what not to. With some skill and understanding of data sets, existing numbers can be extracted and analyzed to understand what is happening. Often I compare local data to equivalent state and national numbers.
While businesses spend significant resources on proprietary market information, many of these private platforms are built from state and federal data. This can’t happen without reliable numbers collected by government. 
I get it; different administrations have different priorities, including Trump and President Joe Biden or even Govs. Mike Braun and Eric Holcomb. While data can be spun, the underlying math doesn’t care about policy but only if it is collected and compiled without an agenda. 
Manipulating a system built with bipartisan trust sets us up for unreliable data. It’s not just an academic project. They are used for calculating Social Security cost of living adjustments, plans to construct new school buildings or how to allocate transportation funds. Cutting data reliability could ripple through the economy for decades to come.  
Americans deserve evidence-based policy, not policy-based evidence.

The drug is expected to be used again for death row inmate Roy Lee Ward's scheduled execution in October. (Getty Images)With just weeks until Indiana’s third scheduled execution in less than a year, debate continues around the state’s supply of pentobarbital — and whether the execution drug can be safely used to kill death row inmate Roy Lee Ward.
Ward is scheduled to die by lethal injection before sunrise on Oct. 10 at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, where he’s currently incarcerated. The date was finalized by the Indiana Supreme Court in an order issued last week. 
Even so, Gov. Mike Braun said on Friday that Indiana’s Department of Correction does not yet have the necessary execution drugs in hand.
When asked about the state’s drug supply, the governor reiterated that Indiana is taking steps to ensure doses do not expire before use.
Braun said the state would not purchase more pentobarbital until necessary. The governor previously disclosed that state officials spent $1.175 million on lethal injection doses over the past year — $600,000 of which was spent on drugs that expired before use. The cost has been between $275,000 and $300,000 per dose.

“Once the Supreme Court weighs in, and the parole board, and we’ve got a date — Oct. 10, that’s not too far away — it’ll be no different from what you saw on the last one,” Braun said, referring to death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie’s execution in May. 
“We’re just managing the resource of what is a very difficult drug to get, and making sure that they don’t expire on the shelves,” he continued. “The state will have [the drug] at the time when we are sure that there’s nothing that can be in the way of [the execution] being completed. And that’s getting close.”
Although the high court rejected Ward’s request to pursue a new post-conviction appeal, justices suggested he could file a separate challenge to Indiana’s execution protocol itself.
Defense attorney Joanna Green told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that Ward’s team does “plan to continue to litigate the drug protocol in federal court” and will likely file a Section 1983 lawsuit — a federal civil rights claim — in addition to a second or successive federal habeas petition.
Ward, 44, was sentenced to death after he pleaded guilty to the 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne in Spencer County. His case has played out through state and federal courts for more than two decades. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case in 2017.
New expert affidavit
Included in new court filings submitted by Ward’s attorneys was an affidavit from Michaela Almgren, a pharmacy professor at the University of South Carolina and compounding drug expert who flagged concerns about the quality, safety and source of the injectable pentobarbital Indiana plans to use. 
The same drug was presumably used in the December execution of Joseph Corcoran, as well as Ritchie’s execution in May.
In her sworn statement, Almgren said Indiana officials are “most likely” purchasing compounded, injectable pentobarbital to carry out executions “because manufactured doses would not most likely have expired before they could have been used.”
At least ten states have either used or intend to use com­pound­ing phar­ma­cies to obtain their drugs for lethal injec­tion, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Story continues below.
Exhibit Q
 
She described compounding as the process used by pharmacists or small pharmacy facilities to mix raw drug ingredients into a usable solution when manufactured versions are unavailable.
Pentobarbital for lethal injection is made by dissolving pentobarbital sodium powder in a mix of chemicals to keep it stable in liquid form. The process typically involves adjusting the drug’s pH with sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid, then adding alcohol and propylene glycol to keep the solution from breaking down, Almgren explained.
But if the balance isn’t exact, the drug can form particles or become too acidic or alkaline, and injection can cause extreme burning and stinging pain or tissue injury.
“If a precipitate or suspension forms, the pentobarbital cannot be safely injected because it would cause extreme pain and suffering to the prisoner … leading to a slow and excruciatingly painful death,” Almgren said.
Unlike medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, compounded drugs are not tested or verified for safety, quality, or effectiveness before use.

Small-scale “503A” compounding pharmacies — which Almgren said are the most likely source of Indiana’s supply — operate under looser standards than large manufacturers and are exempt from routine FDA inspections.
She emphasized in her affidavit that compounded pentobarbital is inherently less stable than manufactured doses, often expiring in days or weeks, and will degrade if not transported and stored correctly.
Almgren noted that manufactured versions last two to three years.
The governor’s office acknowledged that two doses previously acquired by Indiana officials expired before they could be used, forcing the state to purchase more.
Because Indiana law shields the identity of suppliers, it’s impossible to know whether the lethal injection drug was prepared by a qualified pharmacist or even in a sterile facility, Almgren warned.
Under Indiana’s statute, “the issuance or compounding of a lethal substance does not constitute the practice of pharmacy” — meaning lethal injection drugs are outside the jurisdiction of the state’s pharmacy board, the health department, or any state licensing agency.
What is pentobarbital? More questions than answers surround Indiana’s new execution drug.

“This indicates that the medications used for lethal injection are prepared without oversight, and their quality cannot be verified,” Almgren said in her affidavit. “As a result, an incorrect (active ingredient) could be used, or a drug could be improperly prepared, potentially causing unnecessary pain and suffering.”
She added that the medication used in Indiana’s lethal injection procedure may be prepared by an individual who is neither qualified nor appropriately trained, and who may not even be a licensed pharmacist.
“If an unqualified person compounds drugs, the risk of medication errors and contamination is significantly higher. They may lack the technical knowledge to ensure correct drug, dosage, sterile technique, and proper handling, leading to variations in potency, degradation, or microbial contamination. Such mistakes can result in ineffective or harmful medications.”
Her affidavit also pointed to accounts from Ritchie’s execution, in which witnesses reported seeing the inmate lurch violently against his restraints after the injection began. No members of the media were permitted to witness, however.
Almgren said Ritchie’s “unexpected reaction raises questions about the quality and effectiveness of the pentobarbital used, as it did not produce the expected effect.” Based on pharmacology, she wrote, such a reaction suggests the drug could have been degraded or improperly prepared.
According to the affidavit, a large intravenous dose of pentobarbital should cause the person to quickly lose consciousness and slip into a deep coma, “ensuring the person simply falls asleep and remains unconscious without experiencing distress or abnormal reactions.”
Remaining avenues
Indiana justices said Ward may still have “other, viable avenues in state or federal court.” He can also seek clemency from the governor.

Ward’s lawyers argued in their August filings that the state’s secrecy surrounding its lethal injection protocol — in addition to concerns with Ritchie’s execution — violated his constitutional rights. 
The Indiana Supreme Court denied his bid to raise those claims through a successive post-conviction case, ruling they go to the method of execution and not the underlying conviction or sentence. Justices noted Ward could pursue those issues through other legal avenues, however.
His defense team has since filed a petition to rehear the case and asked the state’s high court to delay the execution date until the DOC has responded to outstanding public records requests.
Ward’s legal counsel filed multiple requests with DOC seeking information about what drugs the state intends to use in Ward’s execution, including “whether they are expired, how they are transported and stored, or their potency and sterility.”
Green said on Tuesday those requests have yet to be filled and that Ward has received “just silence” from DOC. They maintained in recent court filings that DOC’s refusal to provide public records on the drugs it intends to use “obstructs (Ward’s) ability to challenge the constitutionality of his execution.”
While details about the state’s execution drugs largely remain shielded, court proceedings earlier this year revealed more about Indiana’s execution procedures than had previously been public. In filings and a declaration from Indiana State Prison Warden Ron Neal, state officials outlined a highly choreographed DOC process overseen by specially-trained staff, including an injection team, IV team, extraction team and death watch unit.
News outlets seek to pause Indiana law barring journalists from witnessing executions

Training occurs every two to three months under normal circumstances but accelerates once an execution date is set.
Neal said that after the Indiana Supreme Court scheduled Ritchie’s execution in April, the team began training weekly. Exercises include hands-on IV insertion practice with EMS equipment and infrared vein-finding technology.
Thirty days before an execution, preparations intensify inside the state prison.
The condemned inmate receives a medical evaluation and weekly vein assessments, while the execution chamber is cleaned and inspected weekly, then daily in the final five days. Equipment, supplies and communication systems linking the prison to the governor’s office and the state Supreme Court are tested, and staff conduct trial runs to ensure victims’ families and defense witnesses remain separated.
In the final weeks, prison officials also meet with the inmate to review the lethal injection process, witness lists and options for spiritual counsel or last words.
State law does not provide access for journalists to witness executions unless invited by the condemned person. A federal lawsuit challenging that restriction is still pending. Indiana Capital Chronicle is a plaintiff in the case.

She recalls starting a shift with two patients. “I did my morning checks and found one patient declining at 7:30 a.m. I did not leave that patient’s room until 5 p.m., except to grab supplies,” she said. “We were short staffed.

She recalls starting a shift with two patients.
“I did my morning checks and found one patient declining at 7:30 a.m. I did not leave that patient’s room until 5 p.m., except to grab supplies,” she said. “We were short staffed. I had no help and had not been able to check in on my other patient as often as I should. Thankfully, they were fairly stable and nothing bad happened.”
Her experience reflects what unsafe staffing looks like in practice. Call lights go unanswered because the nurse is already with another patient. Medications are delayed. Basic needs such as meals, mobility or clean linens are rushed. Even safety practices like double-checking medications or repositioning patients are cut short.
What begins as a missed task quickly becomes a dangerous pattern. The result is greater risk for patients and greater liability for the nurse.
By 2023, Missouri’s nurse vacancy had eased to 15.6% and turnover to 16.3%, yet the financial and workforce strain has not lifted. Replacing a single bedside RN costs hospitals about $61,000, and with nearly 97,000 nurses leaving the profession nationwide between 2020 and 2022, Missouri risks being pulled into the same cycle of loss.
Even as new graduates enter the workforce, hospitals will likely find it harder to stabilize staffing if experienced nurses continue to leave.
More importantly, experience cannot be replaced.
Losing RNs with years of experience leaves gaps in judgment, crisis response and mentorship, forcing new graduates to shoulder unsafe assignments without support. As Kortni put it: “We lost so many nurses. We lost experienced nurses, nurses you look up to, nurses you can ask for help when you need. We did not have enough experience as a unit most shifts.”
Opponents to staffing ratios often argue that Missouri cannot afford staffing laws, especially in rural facilities at risk of closure. Other states have addressed these concerns by phasing in standards and allowing exceptions for emergencies, proving that safety and flexibility can coexist.
The crisis is not only about the number of nurses. Every department is short staffed, and nurses are left to bridge the gap.
When other departments run short, from housekeeping to respiratory therapy, nurses absorb their tasks on top of their own.
“We are given more and more work, having to do the work of pharmacy, housekeeping, dietary, PT, OT, RT, and so much more on top of our own nursing responsibilities,” Kortni said. “Every day nurses go to work they are risking their nursing license. The tasks are so overwhelming that mistakes are made, and some of those mistakes lead to not only patient harm but harm to nurses.”
She often went without meals until late afternoon, sometimes unable to chart until after noon.
“While I was breastfeeding I would miss so many pumps at work that my supply dried up. I didn’t have enough time and would only pump during my lunch break. That was devastating to me,” she said. “I dreaded work, I cried driving in from the stress of it. I was so scared to make a mistake.” Less than five years into her career, she made the decision to leave. “I decided I wanted out of the profession not even 5 years into my career.”
Staffing laws are not a silver bullet. They cannot, on their own, fix the nationwide shortage of nurses or erase financial pressures on hospitals.
What they can do is set a baseline of safety that gives nurses the ability to practice their profession as it was intended.
When nurses are supported with safe assignments, they are better able to use their training, prevent complications, and mentor newer staff. Hospitals also benefit: stronger retention, lower turnover costs, and improved patient outcomes follow when nurses have the resources to do their jobs safely. Without enforceable standards, every other reform collapses under chronic understaffing.
A 2023 study by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing found that more than half of nurses under 35 are considering leaving bedside care within the next year, most citing burnout, unsafe ratios and lack of support. Research shows inadequate ratios drive higher mortality, more falls, and infections; one JAMA study found each additional patient raised the risk of death within 30 days by 7 percent.
Poor outcomes are not inevitable. Safe staffing standards are not only about supporting nurses, they are about protecting Missourians who walk into hospitals trusting they will receive safe care. Hospitals face real financial challenges, but other states have shown these standards can be phased in while still achieving long-term savings through reduced turnover and improved outcomes.
Missouri can do both: support hospitals while protecting patients when they need care most.
Missouri has options. It could phase in staffing ratios gradually, provide targeted support for rural hospitals and expand nursing education programs through scholarships and loan forgiveness. Taken together, these steps could create the conditions for safe care that supports nurses while improving patient safety.
I was a new nurse when I first met Kortni. She was the kind of colleague you could trust in a crisis and learn from just by watching. Losing her shows how Missouri’s failure to pass staffing laws drives nurses out and leaves patients at risk. Kortni’s story makes clear this is not about individual choice. She made lifelong friendships and learned much from bedside nursing, but unsafe staffing pushed her out less than five years into her career.
Missouri lawmakers are set to face these issues next year, when legislation imposing enforceable nurse-to-patient ratios is sure to be under consideration.  Until lawmakers act, unsafe staffing risks remain the default in Missouri hospitals — putting both patients and nurses at risk.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/200413_UH_COVID_ProgressiveCare-144-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-03 06:57:03.927843

Malik Yakini explained the meaning on PBS’s “American Black Journal” “Black reading is crucial for Black survival,” Yakini said. He said reading helps people connect with history and culture while also building strong habits for the future.
The tradition began in Detroit in 1980, when activists including Nkiruka Yakini, Osei Nxele, Malik Yakini, Helen Ray, and David Rambeau started the Black Reading Month Committee. They promoted the celebration with book fairs, forums, and other events. 
In 1985, Njia Kai created the “Turn Off the TV” campaign, which became a key part of the movement.
Michigan events this month
This year marks the 45th anniversary of Black Reading Month. Across Michigan, schools, libraries, and bookstores are joining in.

Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History (Detroit): Continuing its Wright Conversations series this fall, with talks from authors and artists on Black history.
Detroit Book City (Southfield): A Black-owned bookstore hosting “Read-In” events and showing new books by Black writers.
Local Libraries: Libraries in Lansing, Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids, and Flint are sharing reading lists and book displays.
Black Reading Month Bookfair (Detroit): Scheduled for Friday, Sept. 26, 2025, from 5–9 p.m. at Mama Imani Humphrey Hall in the Detroit Food Commons, 8324 Woodward Avenue.
Families and schools are also creating their own observances, from reading challenges to book club meetings.

Why it matters
“Black Reading Month is more than just reading,” Yakini posted on his Facebook page on Monday. “It is about learning, pride, and giving power to voices that are not always heard. Picking up a book by a Black author can help readers see the past more clearly, understand today’s world, and imagine new futures. Detroit started Black Reading Month, but now it is all over Michigan. 
Yakini said people can participate by first turning off the TV, and then by reading a book by a Black author, or going to an event. 
“It is a way to keep the tradition alive,” Yakini said.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)When I began my career as an elementary school teacher, back-to-school time was filled with anxieties about busy school schedules, homework policies and how to make learning fun and effective. But now teachers are kept up at night worrying about how they’d keep a class full of kids safe if a gunman comes to their school. As a human shield, they can only cover a few small children.
This year, two mass shootings in two days  — at Annunciation School and near Cristo Rey Jesuit High School —  has left the Twin Cities reeling from horrific acts of violence and wondering how we can protect our children and families from this public health crisis.
It will take law enforcement time to learn the details and lessons of these shootings. What we already know is that this problem is something we must tackle. There is not one simple fix. As Minneapolis Mayor Frey said, we cannot meet this overwhelming problem with a shrug. Every sector of our society can commit to a solution in their wheelhouse and here’s ours, as educators: School districts can lead the task of educating families on how to save lives.
We need to treat gun violence like the public health problem it is and communicate to our school communities and loved ones about the importance of identifying warning signs, intervention and the life-saving act of secure storage of firearms. As a country, we’ve solved big public health challenges before. In the early 1980s, less than 20% of drivers wore seat belts – now that number is over 90%. Seat belt use is up and traffic fatalities are down.
In a nation with more guns than people, anyone and everyone who owns a firearm can commit to secure storage of that weapon. Incidents in schools are far too common.
Virginia parents were charged after their six-year-old son took an unsecured firearm to school in his backpack. It was discharged in the classroom. Fortunately, no one was seriously hurt.
Teachers do not have a seat at the table when it comes to gun violence prevention and protocols on the national, local and district level. But they should. Teachers are trusted messengers and experts on kids: 61% of Americans view teachers as “highly” trusted and credible – the 2nd-highest rating among all professions, according to a 2025 Gallup survey.
As a survivor of the tragic Sandy Hook school shooting that took the lives of 20 students and six adults, I know just how tragic and enduring these tragedies are and the challenging aftermath ahead for the families, survivors and educators impacted. We live in a country where there are an average of 57 incidents of gun violence every day in America in or near schools, and where firearms remain the leading cause of death for children and teens.
Teachers and staff are on the frontlines of community and school gun violence and they wear many hats as first responders. They’re counselors when gun violence impacts neighborhoods, nurses when kids are sick from the fear and stress when shootings unfold near and afar, clergy when students need reminders of resiliency and safety.
More than 379,000 kids have been impacted by gun violence since Columbine. As teachers, we lack a playbook for how to care when one of them ends up in your classroom, nor how to teach kids who are unavailable for learning due to trauma, how to restore routine when the entire school has been impacted, how to prepare the class for an injured student’s return, or how to explain a child will never come back to class.
In 2023, Minnesota legislators passed a “red flag” law and universal background checks, but even states with the best gun laws on the books need robust education to the community, especially when it comes to safe firearm storage.
Minnesota school districts can prioritize communicating to parents about tips for safe firearms storage and empower teachers to be part of these messages. And they can do so multiple times throughout the year.
We have a choice: We can continue on, like normal where nothing ever changes, and our students, teachers, parents and communities continue to live with the pain of horrific violence. Or we can get to work.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NN250827_0300-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-03 06:57:03.927843

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin grass-roots advocates called on state lawmakers Tuesday to adopt a platform for workers that would nearly triple the state’s minimum wage, then increase it to keep pace with rising prices.
“The key here is to not leave workers behind with a poverty wage, but instead bring that living wage number up to at least $20 an hour,” said Peter Rickman, president of the Milwaukee Area Service and Hospitality Workers union — MASH — at a press conference Tuesday in the state Capitol.
Wisconsin’s minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour, the same as the federal minimum, which was last set in 2009.
The timing of Tuesday’s press conference, organized by a coalition that includes MASH, was part of the group’s message to lawmakers and to the public.
Monday was Labor Day, “when politicians issue statements celebrating the American worker, maybe even declaring their support for labor and the working class,” Rickman observed.
“But we’re here the day after Labor Day, calling on political leadership in Wisconsin to make all of those statements real,” he said. “To make work pay, to deliver for the working class majority in our state with a guarantee that no matter where we punch a clock, no matter where we bring our paychecks home, that paycheck has a living wage.”
A hotel worker named Adrienne, who did not give her last name, said the current minimum wage “keeps the pay ceiling embarrassingly low for workers at a time when housing has become less and less secure, health care is being threatened, grocery prices are at an all-time high, and educational expenses are crippling entire generations.”
Rickman told the Wisconsin Examiner Adrienne didn’t further identify herself because she works at a nonunion Milwaukee hotel that is currently being organized by MASH.
“I have to express my disappointment with the way many of our representatives have failed to show up for workers like myself,” Adrienne told reporters. “Twenty-five dollars an hour would be a wage that would allow workers to thrive and build further futures, but today we’re simply asking for a wage that will allow workers to survive.”
Sabrina Prochaska, a barista at Anodyne Coffee in Milwaukee, said her current wage of $15.81 an hour isn’t enough to cover her living expenses, including groceries, rent and health care.
“Every month my partner and I scrape together money to pay rent on our one-bedroom apartment,” Prochaska said. “And I’m stressed out every 30 days because I know half my paycheck is going to go to put a roof over our heads.”
A recent visit to urgent care was billed at more than $3,000, Prochaska said, “and the truth is I don’t know how to pay that off and I don’t know how I’m going to cover it.”
Anodyne employees voted unanimously in June for MASH to represent them. “We’re ready to do whatever it takes to win living wages at the bargaining table,” Prochaska said. “It’s time for these politicians to do what people like me do every day: Show up, do their job and take care of their people. It’s time to make work pay. It’s time for a living wage for all Wisconsin workers like me.”
In addition to MASH the coalition that sponsored Tuesday’s press includes Citizens Action Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Working Families Party/Power, along with Our Wisconsin Revolution and the Fighting Oligarchy Coalition.
Our Wisconsin Revolution grew out of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign. The Fighting Oligarchy Coalition is a new grass-roots organization that formed as Sanders embarked on a “Fighting Oligarchy” tour to oppose the influence of billionaires in the current U.S. political environment.
The proposal outlined Tuesday hasn’t yet found its way into proposed legislation, but organizers of the campaign said they are clear on what it should include.

“We are calling on [state lawmakers] to, in collaboration with the Living Wage Coalition, draft comprehensive living wage legislation, with a $20 minimum, indexed to inflation, reduce the tip penalty, and restore local control,” Rickman said.
The “tip penalty” refers to the lower minimum wage for Wisconsin employees whose jobs make them eligible for tips — $2.33 an hour. The group also wants to repeal state laws that prevent local governments from setting labor standards.
Rickman said recent state and federal measures to abolish the tax on tips for tipped employees should not undermine the effort to stop paying tipped employees much less than the minimum wage.
“Tax policy… in lieu of wages has never done enough to increase working class household income,” he said. “It’s a scam.” All businesses, he added, “no matter what they do, [should] guarantee a living wage, not leave it up to government tax expenditures.”
Simon Rosenblum-Larson, an organizer for the Fighting Oligarchy Coalition, said the campaign to guarantee livable wages would “create real economic growth as workers here in Wisconsin spend their money here in Wisconsin instead of CEOs that take the money out of state [where] they buy houses, they put money in offshore bank accounts and trust funds for their kids.”
The campaign also lays down a marker for the 2026 elections.
In Wisconsin, 800,000 workers would see a raise if the minimum wage were increased to $20 an hour, Rosenblum-Larson said. “And we will be demanding that every legislator, Democrat or Republican, pledge their support in the 2026 election cycle for a $20 an hour minimum wage for every Wisconsinite.”

(Photo courtesy of Altitude Water)A company looking to make clean drinking water more climate-resilient and accessible during disasters found an ideal testing ground in an unlikely place: Amy Grant’s farm in Tennessee.
Florida-based Altitude Water began working with the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter in 2014, when she needed a drinking water source to support a youth summer camp on the rural property in a short time frame.
Grant already had one of the company’s smaller machines, which use technology to pull water from the humid atmosphere. In a matter of weeks, Altitude Water installed a large machine capable of producing more than 100 gallons of drinking water each day, enough to have a gallon of water on hand for each camp attendee.
“We got it done,” Altitude Water Founder and COO Jeff Szur said. “Then from that, as the farm kept growing, we needed more water. She allowed us to use the farm to do some research and development.”
Eleven years later, Grant’s Hidden Trace Farm in Williamson County is now fully water independent — generating, purifying and storing up to 800 gallons of water each day with no reliance on city infrastructure, Szur said.

The system is an unassuming cluster of machines and storage tanks tucked under a covered patio.
An atmospheric water generator uses evaporation and condensation to turn humidity from the air into water. An ozone generator runs an electrical charge through the air to create ozone gas. That ozone is then used to purify rainwater and water from the sulfur-laden aquifer below ground.
Using ozone to purify water is also a time-tested idea first developed in the 1890s in Europe.
Weather at Altitude Water’s South Florida headquarters is often hot and humid, ideal conditions for the atmospheric water generators to produce high water yields. But other areas of the country — and the world — experience greater range.
The company needed to test the machines’ limits in cooler, dryer conditions.
“Testing at Amy Grant’s farm gave us the cooler temperatures and conditions we needed to develop the water and purification systems we are now using in disaster zones and rural communities,” Szur said.
Altitude Water’s smallest machine, which is about the size of a 5-gallon water cooler and sells for around $4,000, can produce up to 15 gallons of water each day. The machine will produce about six gallons of water in 74-degree weather with 45% humidity, he said.
That drops to three and a half gallons at 35% humidity.
“We can only take the water out that’s in the air,” Szur said.
Grant’s farm uses a machine that can produce around 185 gallons of water in 24 hours.
While other companies make machines that similarly use evaporation and condensation to produce water from the air — a natural process that Szur says no one can patent — Altitude Water does hold a patent for their ozone injection system.
The “water hub” system first tested at Hidden Trace can now be seen around the world, providing water to off-grid Maka, Cameroon, and helping survivors in Asheville, North Carolina, in the months after Hurricane Helene.
“As communities across the U.S. face ground contamination, aging infrastructure, and climate-driven water emergencies, the work we’ve achieved at Hidden Trace Farm has given us a replicable path forward,” Szur said.
 Water, power and cell service on wheels

Altitude Water’s Disaster Relief Trailer got one of its first field tests after wildfires scorched Maui in 2023. It was equipped with a machine that could capture up to 390 gallons of water from the air per day, and a 500-gallon storage tank. There was no time to set the trailer up for solar power, Szur said, so it ran off of a diesel generator.
The company’s second trailer — this time, with a solar power option — was put to the test in Asheville after Hurricane Helene.
Altitude Water partnered with Grassroots Aid Partnership and Footprint Project, a nonprofit that provides solar power for communities facing crisis, for disaster response efforts.
The trailer was equipped with machines able to produce 210 gallons of water and purify 1,500 gallons. Solar panels could generate 12 kilowatts an hour and with 60 kilowatts of battery storage that allowed the water purification machine to run at night. The company also installed Starlink satellite technology, providing phone and internet service.
“It’s basically a command center with everything you need, without having to ship everything in every day,” Szur said. “You don’t have to ship in gas; you don’t have to ship in bottled water. And then you have your communications, which we added because we saw in Maui — with all the towers burned — how bad the logistics were.”
The trailer is compatible with a gas generator and municipal hookups as well, “because you never know when you get into a disaster what the situation is going to be.”
Dave Anderson, executive director of Grassroots Aid Partnership, recounted his organization’s initial recovery efforts in Asheville in a November video posted to social media. Upon setting up their food operation, they discovered there was no water, power, internet or phone service.
“We forget how reliant we are on these things, so when Altitude came in with this trailer, Bamo! We had water. We had internet, and we had power, so that was a great thing to just start off with,” Anderson said.
Flexibility proved helpful in Asheville, where the trailer stayed for a little over three months, Szur said. The weather became cold and dry, significantly reducing the amount of water that could be pulled from the air.
But the trailer’s water purification capabilities and solar power remained useful, he said.
“Being able to purify the water using our ozone purification process was a godsend, and again, it was being able to do the research and development on Amy’s farm that enabled us to do that,” Szur said.
Szur, who studied economics and business at Vanderbilt University, said he and his father entered the water business together after selling their respective restaurant and oil well businesses.
“We looked at a lot of the industries and thought that water was going to be the next oil,” Szur said. “We’ve spent centuries using water as our dumping ground to all these chemicals and just trying to dilute the chemicals down to a level that’s safe to drink.”
But it’s not just about technology that provides clean water, he said.
“It can not only help people by giving them a resource, but also give them hope,” Szur said.

Trump's executive order criminalizing American flag burning undermines, rather than protects, our political freedom, writes columnist Rod Miller.
The post Pledging allegiance to a symbol appeared first on WyoFile .","President Donald Trump signed an executive order that criminalizes the burning of the American flag. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that burning the flag is protected speech under the First Amendment to our Constitution. What are we to make of this?

Opinion

I am first reminded of a quote from columnist Molly Ivins, my favorite Tejana. She wrote, “I prefer someone who burns the flag and then wraps themselves up in the Constitution over someone who burns the Constitution and then wraps themselves up in the flag.”
Ivins’ quote assumes that there is a level of difference between our flag and our Constitution. She’s right, there is a stark difference between the two. And for those of you who just puckered up for patriotic reasons, read on.
The difference lies in the fact that the flag is a SYMBOL of the United States, and the Constitution is the real thing.
Better semanticists than I — like Korzybski, Hayakawa and Wittgenstein — can explain more clearly how symbols are not real things. The map is not the territory. The symbol is not the thing it symbolizes.
They would tell you that symbols are convenient shortcuts to thinking. That a fixation on the symbolic excuses a lazy mind from doing real mental labor. For someone to blindly embrace a symbol as if it has real meaning, and to neglect to seek the reality behind the symbol, is to fall into a comfortable intellectual trap.
Perhaps that is the reason that some folks firmly believe that the flag symbolizes them and their egos. Thus, they ostentatiously display the flag as a symbol of their own patriotism, when the Pledge of Allegiance clearly states that the flag stands for our republic alone.
Symbols like Old Glory, or a star-spangled screaming eagle tattoo, or a Harley Davidson festooned with stars and stripes are great tools for provoking emotional responses and fervid patriotic reactions, but they are not the real deal. Our Constitution is.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)
Symbols are easily manipulated to stir us up emotionally, but they are no help in a pinch when reality is required.
Case in point. If you are ever called upon to defend your inviolable civil rights against a government that wants to violate them, you’ll end up in a courtroom. The American flag sits idle in a corner of that room, hanging limply from a pole, while the Constitution of the United States is by your side, working. The flag won’t help you, but the Constitution, embodied in the law, will.
Do you now see what Ivins was saying?
Or consider this: The flag prompts us to think of government as “we.” Our Constitution, and everything that went into adopting it, prompts us to think of government as “they.”
This manner of thinking sharpens the dichotomy of how we think about the flag and the Constitution. If citizens accept the definition of the flag as “we,” of course, they’ll get offended when someone burns it. The act becomes a personal attack, an attack on how someone thinks about themselves, an attack on their patriotism, even if that patriotism is blind.
If, however, citizens view the flag as a symbol of government as “they,” then a flag burning will be looked upon as an affirmation of the citizens’ superiority over government. Burning the flag says that government must align itself with the citizenry, not vice versa.
The United States Supreme Court agrees with the latter view. In Texas v. Johnson (1989), the court affirmed that burning the American flag is protected speech under the Constitution. Since that decision, both sides of the political spectrum have displayed disrespect for the flag as disrespect for government. And the Constitution protects both sides.
For a president, or anyone else for that matter, to try to penalize disrespect for a symbol, like the flag, is tantamount to saying that the symbol is more important and more worthy of protection than what it symbolizes. To violate an American citizen’s right to burn the flag as a form of political expression, places a piece of cloth above the instrument that guarantees that right. It is the triumph of symbolism over reality.
The American flag symbolizes, among other rights, the right of a citizen to burn it. For Trump or any other politician to criminalize flag burning is to reduce the flag’s symbolism to the merely patriotic and, by extension, to reduce our Constitution to mere words on paper.

Laramie District Court judge finds plaintiffs do have standing to claim harm in lawsuit against the state’s new school-choice program, which remains in limbo.
The post Judge denies Wyoming’s motion to dismiss school voucher lawsuit appeared first on WyoFile .","In the latest blow to Wyoming’s controversial universal school voucher program, a judge has denied the state’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit challenging it. 
The Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act program has been dogged by constitutionality concerns since well before it was enacted into law in March. Educators and parents filed suit in June, and Wyoming’s attempts to advance the voucher payments in the face of the lawsuit have repeatedly failed. 
The program is designed to offer Wyoming families $7,000 per child annually for K-12 non-public-school costs like tuition or tutoring. The scholarship would also offer money for pre-K costs, but only to income-qualified families at or below 250% of the federal poverty level. It was passed amid a wave of school-choice laws, particularly in Republican-led states like Wyoming. 
However, Wyoming’s constitution makes public education a paramount state commitment. Critics of the universal voucher program say spending public funds on private education violates several of the state’s constitutional obligations and have long warned the matter would end up in the courts. 
So far, state gambits to circumvent legal challenges have been unsuccessful. Laramie County District Court Judge Peter Froelicher granted a temporary injunction pausing the voucher program in June, then extended that injunction in July. More recently, he denied a request by Wyoming Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder and others to let the law take effect while they challenge the injunction.
In the newest decision, issued Aug. 28, Froelicher denied the state’s motion to dismiss, determining that plaintiffs do have standing to sue. In the order, Froelicher also determined that Wyoming’s State Treasurer Curt Meier, who the lawsuit names, is a valid defendant. The state asked that Meier be dropped from the suit.
Degenfelder, who championed the voucher program as a major school-choice win, has expressed dismay over the lawsuit’s impacts on families who had already applied and were awaiting funds to pay for costs like textbooks, tutoring or private school uniforms for the 2025-26 school year. 
Rocky road 
The universal voucher program represents a major expansion of the state’s 2024 education savings accounts, which offered money to income-qualified students for private school tuition or homeschool costs. 
The 2025 bill transformed that program by stripping income qualifications so that the $7,000 would be available to everyone. 
The bill ignited one of the hottest debates of the recent session. It sparked a deluge of feedback, both from school-choice proponents and critics who called it unconstitutional.

Lawmakers transformed it before it passed out of the Legislature; they brought 26 amendments, including 11 that passed. They also repeatedly questioned the constitutionality of the expanded program. Many urged colleagues to hold off and allow the existing education savings account program to roll out before changing it so drastically. Those requests did not sway the body.
The new program’s application opened on May 15, attracting nearly 4,000 student applications. But in June, nine parents of school-aged children and the Wyoming Education Association, which represents more than 6,000 of the state’s public school employees, sued Degenfelder, Meier and the state of Wyoming.
A previous Wyoming Supreme Court ruling on education funding “found that ‘education is a fundamental right’ in Wyoming, that ‘all aspects of the school finance system are subject to strict scrutiny,’ and that ‘any state action interfering with [the right to equal educational opportunity] must be closely examined before it can be said to pass constitutional muster,’” the lawsuit reads.
This voucher program, plaintiffs assert, does not pass that muster. That’s because “the state cannot circumvent those requirements by funding private education that is not uniform and that meets none of the required state constitutional standards for education.”
In addition, the program is unconstitutional because it violates constitutional language that allows the state to give public funds only for the necessary support of the poor, the lawsuit argues. Instead, it’s an example of “gratuitously funneling public funds to private individuals and entities, regardless of whether they are poor and regardless of whether that support is necessary.” 
Parents who signed onto the case oppose the voucher plan due to the harmful impact it will have on their children, according to the lawsuit, “because private schools receiving voucher funding can refuse admission to children with disabilities … and are not required to provide special education services or comply with [individualized education programs].” They are also concerned that private schools can refuse to admit and educate children who identify as queer, transgender or non-binary.

The voucher program will also negatively impact funding at public schools that the parents’ children attend, the lawsuit says.
By rejecting the state’s motion to dismiss, Froelicher accepts “the individual harms alleged in the complaint as true,” according to his order. 
What’s next 
The Wyoming Attorney General’s office in July appealed Froelicher’s preliminary injunction preventing the Wyoming Department of Education from transferring or paying out funds to participants of the program. 
In a July update on the Wyoming Department of Education’s site, Degenfelder said she is grateful the attorney general appealed to the Wyoming Supreme Court, but informed the public that “the appeals process is still extensive, and, unless the injunction is stayed while the appeal proceeds, may cause the program funds to be unavailable for most of the 2025-26 school year.”

Instead, his wife found out through a Facebook post that the 160-acre parcel of land near Driggs and the Teton Range is set to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.
Even though Beard’s family signed a lease with the state to graze cattle on the property through 2032, the Facebook post was true.
On July 15, the Idaho State Board of Land Commissioners voted 5-0 to sell the 160-acre parcel of land, which state officials refer to as the Driggs 160, through a public auction. 
“We had always said we figured the state land was probably one of the last pieces of land we would lose,” Beard said. “We thought we were pretty connected with it until at least 2032 (when our lease is up). We’ve always known someone could come in and outbid us at the next renewal. We have always known we could lose this in 2032, but I was never expecting them during the middle of our lease to just put it up for sale.”
On July 21, about a week after the Land Board’s vote, someone from the Idaho Department of Lands finally told Beard the land was going to be sold.
Beard was confused and upset by the sale, which he said is the latest hardship he has faced as a small family rancher trying to carry on the legacy his late grandfather and late father taught him when he was just a boy.
 Development comes to Idaho’s Teton County

Beard and his wife are raising young children that Beard hopes will have an opportunity to become the sixth generation of ranchers in the Beard family. But Beard worries they have been priced out of Teton County and says it is harder than ever for small ranchers to make a living, which is why he also works at a local communications company and ranches on nights and weekends.

“We’ve relied on that piece of ground for the last 30-some years, and I was under the impression my kids might be inheriting the lease on the land one day,” Beard said. “It’s a lifestyle I’m not ready to give up just because someone wants to sell off all the ground.”
Driggs, Tetonia and Teton County, Idaho, are located in eastern Idaho in the shadow of the world-famous Teton Range and Grand Targhee Resort, which is undergoing an expansion. Teton County has been booming with development since the early 2000s, and Beard said development and inflated property values have put the squeeze on family ranchers who have worked the land since well before out-of-state millionaires and billionaires began buying up land and moving nearby. 
Losing the grazing land compounds Beard’s problems.
“It’s put me in a hard spot,” Beard said. “It’s hard to find pasture over here with all subdividing going on.”
The lease allowed Beard to graze 45 cattle for 45 days each summer on the state endowment land, which is located just about a mile from the ranch where Beard lives. He paid about $963 a year for the lease and also took care of the land. His family spent about two years installing a fence on the property by hand – stretching barbed wire and pounding posts into the ground.
Beard still continues to maintain the fence and haul water to the property for his cattle.
“I treated the land with respect; we’ve been good stewards of the land,” Beard said. “It’s just kind of a kick to the face to find out they cut your lease short because they got a better offer from someone instead of fulfilling the lease we had.”
Although the Land Board voted to sell the land, the auction has not taken place, and there is no deal in place yet. Teton County commissioners also have the ability to object to the sale.
Meanwhile, Beard shared an online petition signed by more than 1,500 people urging the Land Board to reconsider the sale of the state endowment land. Data from Change.org indicates that 60% of the people who signed the petition are from three Idaho ZIP codes, 83455, 83422 and 83452, which include Tetonia, Driggs and Victor. 
The Land Board is expected to discuss the sale again Sept. 16.

 Why is the state of Idaho preparing to auction off the endowment land near Driggs?

Officials told the Idaho Capital Sun the state began considering the auction after a local landowner approached them with interest in buying the 160-acres parcel of endowment land that Beard’s family has been leasing. (State officials declined to identify the interested local landowner to the Sun, but said they expect multiple parties to be interested in the land due to the values of surrounding parcels).
State endowment lands are specifically governed by a section of the Idaho Constitution that requires the state to manage those lands for the maximum long-term financial return for beneficiaries. 
Long story short, state officials say the property is generating about $960 a year in lease revenue now, but selling the property could generate millions of dollars for the state. 
“We’re tasked with maximizing revenue on state endowment lands under that constitutional mandate,” Idaho Department of Lands Director Dustin Miller told the Sun. “When we run into problems, is (when) the underlying value of that ground becomes so high, and if we’re not making or producing the right amount of revenue on that property, then we’ve got to look at other options.”
A state legislator who has followed the issue says it’s creating a challenge for Beard, but he does understand the constitutional issues. Assistant Idaho Senate Majority Leader Mark Harris is a member of the Republican leadership team and a rancher from Soda Springs. 
“The issue I have is the lease. His lease is not up, and here the state is talking about selling that parcel of ground and basically negating the rest of the lease, which I think is unfair,” Harris told the Idaho Capital Sun. “However, I can see the state of Idaho’s perspective and Article 9, Section 8 of the state Constitution, requiring the state to maximize revenue of endowment land. I can see both sides, but I think the problem is growth.”
Sympathetic to Beard’s situation, Harris and another state legislator attended a Teton County Commission meeting in August to learn more about the issue and see if they could help Beard.
County commissioners have the option to object to the sale, which could be discussed again during the upcoming Sept. 16 meeting of the Land Board at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise.
Moving forward, Harris said he doesn’t want what happened to Beard to happen to other lease holders, and he thinks the Idaho Legislature and the executive branch of government should “figure out and discuss” the issue.
“For future issues that come up like this, I think we as the state need to seriously consider the lease agreement on these parcels, if we are going to see them out to the end or terminate them,” Harris said. “A lease is an agreement, and my opinion is that those leases should be honored until the end.”
For their part, state officials said there are no legal barriers to auctioning the land even with the lease in place. Leases generally include fine print that allows the state to break the lease once notification requirements have been met.
During the July Land Board meeting, Real Estate Bureau Chief Roger Hall told the Land Board there were no legal barriers or limitations to reclassifying the land even with the current grazing lease.  
 Is Idaho’s state endowment land public?

The state’s planned sale of the Driggs 160 endowment land comes at a time when public lands have become a flashpoint in America. 
This year, there was a massive public backlash to unsuccessful efforts by U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to make millions of acres of public land – including in Idaho – available to be sold off to the highest bidder.

Idaho state officials say this government owned state endowment land near Driggs is different than land owned by the federal government. 
State endowment land including the Driggs 160 is not considered public land, said Miller, the director of the Idaho Department of Lands. 
“These lands are not public lands, they’re state endowment trust lands, and the landlord has sole authority over their sale, disposition, the purchase of additional lands and leasing over those lands,” Miller said. 
The land is not a park or a forest, and it is not staffed for recreational use, Miller said.
However, Miller and Beard agree that there is currently public access to the land. 
Beard said each spring, members of the public access the land to look for shed antlers, while each summer and fall people take their dogs there to train them or prepare for hunting season. 
Beard said he has always been fine with people accessing the land as long as they keep the gate closed and don’t litter or abuse the land, and he has never had problems with the public.
“I am all for people selling private ground, but I don’t think one ounce of public ground should be sold off and auctioned to the highest bidder,” Beard said. 
 Who will end up with the state endowment land if it is auctioned off?

State officials say the endowment land will be sold to the highest bidder in an open public auction anybody can participate in, so they have no idea who will buy it. State officials also declined to say who reached out expressing interest in buying the land.
However, Beard said lawyers representing a neighboring land owner, Thomas Tull, reached out to him expressing interest in the land just after Beard’s dad died in 2021. 
Tull is a billionaire businessman and movie producer who has invested in AI research. Idaho campaign finance records show that in 2023, Tull contributed $25,000 to the Friends of Brad Little political committee. As governor, Little is chairman of the Land Board and voted to approve the sale of the endowment land in July.
Beard said he has never had a problem with Tull and gets along well with his local ranch manager.
“I have nothing bad to say about the Teton Ridge Ranch; they’ve been great,” Beard said, noting that the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen owned the ranch before Tull’s company.
Little’s press secretary Joan Varsek issued a written statement saying state officials are obligated to seek the maximum financial return on the endowment land. Varsek also said anybody can participate in the auction.
“The governor and his fellow Land Board members have a constitutional duty to generate maximum returns on the management and disposition of endowment lands,” Varsek said Friday. “They unanimously approved moving toward a public auction for the disposition of Driggs 160, and anyone can bid at auction. The current grazing lease on the land generates under $1,000 annually for the endowment beneficiary, and it is anticipated multiple people will be interested in acquiring this highly valued property.”
Varsek referred questions about political contributions to Little’s campaign team. As of Friday, Little has not yet publicly announced if he will seek re-election in 2026 or publicly unveiled a campaign team.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)An ex-House staffer convicted in a political corruption case is requesting a joint sentencing hearing with his former boss where they are expected to object to the rules for calculating their sentences.
Cade Cothren, chief of staff for former House Speaker Glen Casada, is asking for his sentencing guidelines hearing to be held at the same time as Casada’s on Sept. 12 at the federal courthouse in Nashville. Casada, though, wants a separate hearing, according to the filing.
Casada was convicted on 17 counts and Cothren on 19 counts of fraud, bribery, theft, conspiracy and money laundering in May. One fraud conviction alone comes with a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
Casada sought a new trial in the case, but U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson hasn’t ruled on the request. 
Former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada, ex-aide, guilty in federal corruption case

A recent filing by Cothren’s attorney, Cynthia Sherwood, says objections by Cothren and Casada to sentencing guidelines “overlap almost completely.” A consolidated hearing will keep the judge from hearing the same argument twice, according to Sherwood’s filing. Joint hearings may be “unusual” but aren’t “unprecedented,” the filing says.
“A joint hearing will also allow Mr. Cothren the opportunity to present his own arguments in support of his objections to the sentencing guidelines, which may be different from, or augment, Mr. Casada’s guidelines arguments,” the filing says.
The filing says U.S. Attorney Taylor Phillips doesn’t oppose a joint sentencing guidelines hearing. 
Casada and Cothren were accused of setting up a secret company called Phoenix Solutions that tapped into the state’s postage and printing program that provides House members $3,000 a year for constituent mailers. Casada and former Rep. Robin Smith, who pleaded guilty and testified against the pair, steered lawmakers’ business to Phoenix Solutions, which was secretly run by Cothren with the front name of “Matthew Phoenix.”
Separately, Casada claims he should be given a new trial because the jury was prejudiced when the prosecution inadvertently played an unredacted version of an FBI interview with him. 
Casada and Cothren sought a mistrial during the four-week trial held earlier this year, based on the audio from 2021 when federal agents raided their homes. They were indicted in August 2022.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)After Muhammad Jawaid, a Chicago rideshare driver, was assaulted by two riders this spring, he changed — in more ways than one. He’d been beaten by two young men who’d used an Uber profile of a young woman to request a ride, he said. At pickup, Jawaid said, the men had jumped into the backseat, hit Jawaid in the head with guns, knocked out several of his teeth, and tried to steal his car.
“I’m not the person [that] I used to be anymore, because it made a huge impact on my life,” Jawaid said.
When Jawaid asked Uber to cover the cost of his injuries, he said, the company offered a fraction of his medical costs alone. Because Jawaid is not considered an employee but an independent contractor — a status both Uber and Lyft have fought hard to preserve for their drivers — he does not qualify for workers’ compensation. Without that protection, rideshare drivers can’t receive replacement wages when they’re injured on the job.
“This act of violence is deeply troubling,” Uber’s spokesperson said in response to questions about Jawaid’s case, adding that the company has spoken to Jawaid and worked with police to resolve the case. The company did not address questions about the cost of Jawaid’s medical care related to the incident. Representatives highlighted several in-app safety features for drivers and optional injury protection insurance that drivers can purchase for “less than $0.03 a mile.”
Frustrated by the company’s response, Jawaid did something new: He reached out to the Chicago Gig Alliance, a rideshare driver group that has been pushing for a city ordinance that would have required the rideshare companies to verify all passenger accounts and provide identity verification to drivers as they pick up passengers. His reason for contacting the group? “Maybe it would be helpful for other people,” he said. (The Chicago City Council tabled the proposed ordinance in June.)
Today, Jawaid’s experience is becoming more common — and not only among rideshare drivers. As workplace violence has risen over the last decade, it has driven an increasing number of workers to organize. Across the country, nurses and cashiers, drivers and food servers are fighting for a right that many take as a given: being safe from violence at work.

The clearest reason that more workers are fighting to end violence at work is that more workers are experiencing violence on the job.
Violent incidents at work have risen by nearly 20% since 2015, going from 34,750 that year to 41,440 in 2022, the most recent year for which statistics are available. Meanwhile, there is no federal workplace safety standard to prevent violence on the job. About two dozen states have proposed or enacted legislation to prevent workplace violence, but the problem persists across the country, per a review of bills and legislation tracked by BillTrack50.
“The experience of workplace violence is being felt most acutely by workers who already are in occupations where their wages have been suppressed,” said Jennifer Sherer, director of the State Worker Power Initiative at the Economic Policy Institute.
The push to address violence on the job appears to be strongest among service and care workers — and especially health care workers. Most of those jobs were not protected by wage and hour laws until the 1960s. In 2021-22, those workers experienced 86% of workplace injuries by another person, according to a Capital & Main analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
“Unionization in those sectors, I think it’s more important than almost any other,” said Sherer.

In New Orleans, for instance, nurses at University Medical Center went on a one-day strike on May 1, and cited workplace violence as the key issue. Indeed, violence at work fueled worker unrest that led to a successful union election in December 2023, said Heidi Tujague, a registered nurse and UMC bargaining team member, via a union spokesperson. It has since been a core bargaining chip in the negotiations for their first contract, an effort that began in March 2024.
Nurses experience various kinds of violence on the job, ranging from pinches and slaps to being kicked in the stomach while pregnant and being choked with stethoscopes, said Jane Thomason, lead industrial hygienist of National Nurses United. They also experience violence far more frequently than many other workers. Health care workers experience violence at work nearly twice as often as workers in education, and 10 times as often as those in retail and food service, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. (Disclosure: National Nurses United is a funder of Capital & Main.)
Smaller surveys suggest that federal statistics reflect “a tiny fraction” of violence in health care, said Thomason. Nearly 82% of 1,000 nurses surveyed by National Nurses United in February 2024 reported at least one violent incident at work in the prior year.
“Workplace violence at UMC is a serious part of what we’re trying to address with our unionization,” Tujague said in a statement. “It’s part and parcel with safe staffing, another one of our key demands. When we’re safely staffed, it makes de-escalation easier.”

Violence at work is driving restaurant workers to organize, too. Such violence has become so prevalent that a video of it has gone viral on social media, becoming popular fodder that overshadows the impact on workers.
For three days starting on May 16, Waffle House employees across the South staged a protest over workplace violence and low pay at the chain.
For Waffle House workers, violence and harassment were part of the job until concerns over workplace violence reached the boiling point when a man forced his way behind the counter of a Marietta, Georgia, Waffle House in April. It was around 6 a.m., a Union of Southern Service Workers spokesperson confirmed. The man pushed an employee to the ground, then ran behind the counter and into the back office of the restaurant, the spokesperson said. He didn’t leave until the police arrived 20 minutes later and escorted him out. (Disclosure: the Union of Southern Service Workers is a cross-sector affiliate of the Service Employees International Union, a financial supporter of Capital & Main.)
Store management appeared to laugh off the incident, said Melissa Steach, a server at the Marietta restaurant. Nothing changed, she said, until workers took action.
Waffle House did not respond to a request for comment.
Without a robust response from management or corporate leadership, Waffle House workers decided they were fed up. Workers from across the region delivered a list of demands to Waffle House offices and held a protest on the first day of the strike. They used the Marietta incident as a catalyst to repeat their ongoing demands for a $25 per hour minimum wage, safer working conditions (including security staff on site) and the end of a mandatory meal deduction policy.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Even with companywide raises announced last year and working full time, Steach said she earns about $2,300 a month: $4.25 an hour in wages that come to roughly $680, and the rest in tips. She has been unable to afford a one-bedroom apartment or studio, both of which cost around $1,300 a month in Marietta, according to Zillow. For now, she lives in a motel and walks to work.
Following the strike, management did not hire security staff. Instead, they changed protocol on the Marietta store’s third shift, locking the store’s doors and limiting service to takeout in the wee hours of the morning, said Steach. For Steach, that decision has led to lower tips, she said.
It has also made Steach more willing to fight — even if she feels a little scared to speak up.
“I know how companies will react,” she said. “Even though it is against federal law to fire someone for organizing, it doesn’t mean they can’t.”
But having her fellow union members’ support meant a lot to her, she said. “I’m tired of looking over my shoulder and wondering, ‘Is this going to be the day that someone decides that they’re going to pull a gun on me?’” Steach said. “I’d like the public to understand that all work has dignity… We are all fighting for the same thing. We’re all fighting for that slice of comfort. That slice of stability. Security.”

(Getty Images)Imagine being told you can’t record what your own government is doing. That’s exactly what happened in Jerome recently, when a reporter was told they couldn’t film a public school board meeting. Think about that: a school board, funded by taxpayers — making decisions that affect families, students, and teachers — telling the press and the public to put their cameras away.
That’s not transparency. That’s secrecy.
Transparent Idaho now offers public education data

To his credit, Superintendent Brent Johnson admitted afterward that the policy was wrong and promised to change it. But here’s the real problem: This wasn’t a one-off. Public officials too often treat “open meetings” as if they’re doing citizens a favor by letting them in the room. That’s not how democracy works. Government belongs to the people, and the people have every right to see it in action — without barriers, excuses or restrictions.
The Idaho Press Club got it right: banning recording is “beyond unreasonable.” The Constitution protects the right to report and record, and Idaho’s open meeting laws exist to prevent exactly this kind of closed-door behavior.
But let’s be honest — just allowing someone to sit in a room isn’t good enough anymore. In 2025, when nearly every citizen carries a high-definition video camera in their pocket, when businesses, churches and even youth sports teams livestream their events, there’s no excuse for government meetings to be stuck in the 1950s.
Other states are moving forward. Montana passed a law requiring school boards, city councils, and county commissions to record and post their meetings online. They didn’t just talk about transparency — they made it the law. Idaho should do the same.
Why does this matter? Because families are busy. Parents are working jobs, shuttling kids to activities and putting dinner on the table. Most people don’t have the luxury of sitting through a two-hour meeting on a Tuesday night. But they should still have the ability to see how decisions are made, how their tax dollars are spent, and whether their elected leaders are serving them — or themselves.
Livestreaming and archiving meetings is not complicated. It’s not expensive. In fact, it’s the cheapest insurance policy for trust in government. Put a $200 camera in the back of the room, hit “record” and upload it to YouTube. Done. If a school or city claims they can’t afford it, they’re not being honest — they just don’t want the public watching too closely.
Here’s the plain truth: When government resists transparency, it’s usually because it has something to hide. And that’s exactly why every meeting should be recorded and shared. Transparency isn’t optional. It’s the foundation of trust.
The people of Idaho shouldn’t settle for vague promises of openness. We deserve laws that guarantee it. Montana got it right. Now it’s Idaho’s turn to step up.
If our kids’ soccer games can be streamed, why can’t our school board meetings? If churches and civic clubs can post recordings, why can’t city councils? The only reason is because some officials would rather you didn’t see what really happens when they think no one is watching.
Well, it’s time to start watching. No more excuses. Record every meeting. Livestream every meeting. Archive every meeting. Let the people see what their government is doing — because it’s their government, not the politicians’.
In a free state, the camera should always be rolling.

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ prison administration agency will enter into a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act at its Malvern facility, Department of Corrections staff told members of the Board of Corrections on Tuesday.
The DOJ found that the Division of Correction (ADC) violated the ADA by failing to provide proper accommodations to inmates with mobility disabilities, excluding them from “safely accessing or participating in its programs, services, activities, and facilities.” The settlement will require the unit to make several changes to ensure compliance, but does not involve a monetary penalty, according to Tawnie Rowell, chief legal officer for the Department of Corrections.
Rowell told board members that the Justice Department’s investigation started with complaints about scalding showers. Once the federal agency started investigating, agents conducted a top-down review.
“We ended up in a less than desirable situation because Ouachita River’s construction was under an old version of the ADA,” Rowell said.
The ADA, first passed by Congress in 1990, prohibits disability discrimination by federal, state and local government and requires employers and government to provide reasonable accommodations to those with disabilities. It was amended in 2008 to broaden the definition of disability in response to U.S. Supreme Court rulings. Disabilities covered under the act can be mental or physical, and do not need to be permanent.
The settlement had been brought before the board earlier this year, Rowell said, but ADC staff had gone back to try to address concerns about DOJ’s access to Division of Correction facilities as part of ongoing compliance monitoring.
“We got this, I think, about as good as they’re willing to go,” Rowell said. “It does still require that we provide a fair amount of access, but we did make it clear that it’s limited to the Ouachita River facility and it’s not going to be global.”
According to a copy of the settlement agreement, the Justice Department began investigating after “inmates with mobility disabilities” said the prison administration failed to provide them with accessible cells and showers at the Ouachita River Unit, causing “ongoing physical harm.”
The inmates also said they were injured by “scalding showers,” and “were not given necessary support or supplies to physically transfer between their wheelchairs and beds, showers, and toilets.” The agreement also noted the inmates said they were not provided adequate medical care.
A survey conducted by the federal government in 2021 found that the Ouachita River Unit had “barriers to access” for inmates with mobility impairments, the settlement document said.
Under the settlement agreement the ADC cannot discriminate against or exclude inmates from medical care, daily activities, education and other programs and services on the basis of their disability.
The division must make a minimum of 3% of the cells in the Ouachita River Unit accessible to inmates with disabilities, and must provide accommodations such as shower chairs and wheelchair maintenance. The settlement also requires the division to appoint an ADA coordinator.
Complying with the settlement will require capital improvements to the unit. The corrections department will be required to hire a DOJ-approved architect to assess whether the fixes made comport with the disability law.
The board approved up to $500,000 for the work at a previous meeting, Rowell said.
The division will also be required to establish and implement “comprehensive housing policies” to ensure inmates with disabilities are housed in “safe, appropriate housing.” The division will be required to report its progress on compliance efforts to the DOJ every six months.

“We want to tell our stories with our voices,” said Stacey LaCompte, director of the North Dakota Native Tourism Alliance. 
She said the group has had success catering to tour groups from Europe. She said the European groups are often in North Dakota for about three weeks and are interested in visiting all five tribal nations that share geography with North Dakota. They often want to take in South Dakota sites, too, she said. 
“They’re paying for the tour. They’re paying for the hotels, the gas, the food,” LaCompte said. “They’re buying souvenirs. They’re buying from our artisans.”

LaCompte and others from the tourism group briefed North Dakota lawmakers on their efforts recently. 
The presentation was to the North Dakota Legislature’s Tribal and State Relations Committee that met at the Dakota Magic Casino near Hankinson on the Lake Traverse Indian Reservation. The reservation lies mostly in South Dakota with a small portion in southeast North Dakota. 
The reservation is the home of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate tribe. Tamara St. John is a historian for the tribe who called North Dakota Native Tourism Alliance “precedent setting,” with similar groups forming in other states after hearing of the success in North Dakota. 
The North Dakota Native Tourism Alliance was formed in 2016. The group began offering cultural tours in 2021.
St. John, a board member for the group, said international travelers are often interested in an “authentic” travel experience to learn about Native American culture. 
“And who better to share that than us,” St. John said. 
Some tour groups from countries such as Norway and Germany are interested in learning about immigrant families that settled in Dakota Territory.

“They want to understand the cultural differences and relationships” with Native Americans, St. John said. 
Fred Walker is global marketing manager for the North Dakota Department of Commerce’s tourism and marketing team. He said in an interview that Europeans do have strong interest in Native American culture and when they visit, will take their time to visit multiple attractions. 
“They spend more time, they spend more money, and they really try to engage into wherever they’re at,” Walker said. “They immerse themselves.”
He said the groups are usually families of four to eight people instead of large tour groups.
European tourists may visit the reservations but tours often include visits to other sites, such as Theodore Roosevelt National Park, the National Buffalo Museum at Jamestown and other museums. 
LaCompte said the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library, which is scheduled to open in Medora next year, has already reached out to the Native Tourism Alliance so the group can be a resource for library visitors. 
Walker said other states, including South Dakota and Montana, have followed North Dakota’s example in forming Native tourism groups. 
North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming and Idaho also have formed a tourism partnership called the Great American West. Each year, it hosts an event called the International Roundup that helps tour promoters learn about attractions and events, including with Native Americans, in the five-state region.

In addition to international tours, Les Thomas, president of the Native Tourism Alliance, said tribes have been building themselves up as tourist destinations beyond casinos. The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, where he is a citizen, has added a water park and trampoline park.
Thomas emphasized the economic impact of tourism for the tribes and North Dakota. 
He said the United Tribes Technical College annual powwow in Bismarck has a $10 million economic impact. The powwow is Friday to Sunday. 
Tourism is on the agenda for Wednesday’s Annual Tribal Leaders Summit that leads up to the powwow.  
He said the tribes also have been participating in more non-tribal events, such as being a sponsor of the Norsk Hostfest in Minot and having dancers perform at Country Fest near New Salem. 
St. John invited North Dakotans to stop at a new visitor center for the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate. 
“There’s so much to be gained by building bridges and building relationships and that’s really what North Dakota tribal tourism is all about,” St. John said.

(Getty Images)Allowing West Virginia families to opt out of the state’s school vaccination requirements has been a priority for Gov. Patrick Morrisey. The state’s new acting health officer agrees with him on the issue. 
Dr. Mark McDaniel
Dr. Mark McDaniel, a doctor of osteopathic medicine and retired state air surgeon for the West Virginia National Guard, started as health officer last week.
“I agree with Gov. Morrisey’s position that no West Virginian should ever be forced to choose between their religious convictions and access to education,” he said in response to questions from West Virginia Watch. “Our governor’s leadership makes clear that protecting fundamental freedoms can go hand-in-hand with safeguarding public health.”
McDaniel fills a role that’s been empty since December, when former health officer Dr. Matt Christiansen resigned. 
The state Department of Health declined West Virginia Watch’s request to interview McDaniel, saying he was getting acclimated to his new position. A spokeswoman for the department returned West Virginia Watch’s questions with answers on his behalf.
McDaniel said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s child and adolescent vaccination schedule is the “recognized national standard for preventing serious illnesses” like polio and measles and that vaccines are “one of the tools proven to reduce disease, hospitalization, and death.” 
“As West Virginia’s state health officer, my responsibility is twofold: first, to provide families with clear, accurate information rooted in science so that parents can make the best choices for their children; and second, to weigh the overall impact on public health, schools, and communities,” he wrote. “Protecting children from preventable disease strengthens families and keeps our communities safe, but at the same time, we respect the role of parents as the primary decision-makers for their children’s health.”
All states require school children to get a series of vaccines for infectious diseases including measles, polio and chicken pox. West Virginia is one of only five states that have not allowed religious or philosophical exemptions for the shots. The state has only allowed medical exemptions. 
Morrisey issued an executive order on his second day in office requiring the state to allow religious exemptions. The order has not been rescinded, though the state Legislature this year rejected a bill that would have set the exemptions in state law. A poll released Tuesday from West Virginia MetroNews indicates that 71% of respondents support the state’s school vaccination requirements. 
Morrisey argues the state’s 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act, read along the state’s vaccination requirements, allows the religious exemptions.
The governor said in a news conference June 24 that as far as his administration was aware, allowing the religious exemption would not lead to any “negative public health effect” for the state.
Asked about Morrisey’s comment, McDaniel said from a health perspective, his responsibility is to educate families about the risks of disease, support informed decisions and maintain strong vaccine coverage. 
“Nearly every other state — 45 across the country — already recognizes religious exemptions,” he said. “West Virginia should not stand alone in denying that choice.”
“The balance we seek is straightforward: uphold individual liberty and religious freedom while continuing to use sound public health strategies to protect our citizens,” McDaniel said. 
Morrisey’s Health Secretary Arvin Singh has also spoken in support of religious exemptions. Singh said that the executive order “ensures that people of faith are not punished for making personal, prayerful decisions about their children’s health.”
In a social media comment, McDaniel linked a deadly measles outbreak in Texas to migrants crossing the country’s southern border. 
“Stop illegals from bringing it across the border,” McDaniel wrote in a comment on Linkedin. 
McDaniel confirmed to West Virginia Watch that he made the comment. He said his point was not to assign blame, but to highlight “a matter of policy consistency.”
“When we talk about protecting public health, it has to apply across the board,” McDaniel said. “We asked West Virginia parents to follow certain requirements in order to send their children to school. At the same time, we had a federal border policy that too often allowed illegal entry without the same level of health screening or accountability.
“That inconsistency undermines confidence in our system,” he said. “My concern is ensuring that our policies are fair, consistent, and protective of both public health and individual rights.”
Texas health officials say they don’t know what led to a measles outbreak that hospitalized nearly 100 people and killed two children. 
Lara Anton, a senior press officer for the Texas Department of Health Services, noted that measles is highly contagious: 90% of people who are not immune to it will get sick if exposed. Cases in the U.S. are often related to international travel to somewhere that measles is still circulating, she said. 
“All we know is that someone who was sick with measles came into contact with a community with low immunity while they were infectious and that sparked an outbreak,” Anton said. 
McDaniel’s comment has drawn criticism from state Democrats.
In a video posted on the social media platform X, state Democratic party chairman Mike Pushkin said “it’s safe to say that what took Gov. Morrisey so long to appoint a public health officer is that he needed to find a doctor who shared some of his very unscientific views.”
McDaniel said his commitment as state health officer is to serve the state with “ honesty, transparency, and accountability.”
“Our focus is on strengthening public health while respecting the values and freedoms of every individual,” he said. “Guided by the governor’s four pillars — we will keep communities safe and build a healthier, stronger future for our state.”

(Photo: Wolf River Conservancy)The Trump administration is moving forward with a plan to open up more than 58 million acres of previously protected national forests to development, including 85,000 acres of Tennessee backcountry. 
In a Wednesday announcement, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said the federal government is giving the public three weeks to weigh in on the proposal to rescind the federal government’s so-called roadless rule. 
Adopted in 2001, the rule has restricted logging, mining, oil drilling and gas extraction in some of the nation’s most remote and untouched public lands – restrictions that the Trump administration is seeking  to lift.
The three-week comment period, which began on Friday before the Labor Day holiday weekend, ends Sept. 19. Public comment periods for similar federal rule changes have previously been open for a month or more. 
85,000 acres of Tennessee’s national forests open for logging under Trump administration plan

Rollins, in a news release, said rescinding the rule was a “common sense” step to remove “burdensome, outdated, one-size-fits-all regulations” that have limited industries that could boost local economies adjacent to public lands.  
The rule, Rollins said, is aligned with President Donald Trump’s executive order to “get rid of overcomplicated, burdensome barriers that hamper American business and innovation.”
Conservation groups, who advocated for the roadless rules for decades before it was adopted, said eliminating the protections places wildlife, clean water, recreation and old-growth forest in peril. 
Of Tennessee’s 698,000 acres of national forested lands, 85,000 have protections under the current roadless rule. 
They include portions of Land Between the Lakes in northern Tennessee and pockets within the Cherokee National Forest that stretches for 660,000 acres across the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Beaver Dam Creek, Slide Hollow, Elk Creek, Bald Mountains, Horse Cove and Sycamore Creek are among the popular backcountry areas currently protected by the roadless rule.

Colom’s entrance into the race is likely to spark a long and expensive battle for the seat, with both national parties expected to spend millions on the race in the Magnolia State. 
Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s Democratic leader from New York, told the New York Times he wants to help elect a Democrat in Mississippi. But the Republican Party is almost certain to defend its ironclad grip on Mississippi, a state where both U.S. Senate seats have been held by the GOP since 1989. 
In an interview with Mississippi Today ahead of his announcement, Colom said he intends to cast Hyde-Smith’s voting record as prioritizing “D.C. politics” instead of hard-working Mississippians, including her vote for the “One Big Beautiful Bill” that slashed social safety net programs and provided tax cuts for the wealthy. 
“Mississippi needs a senator who’s going to put Mississippi first,” Colom said.
But Colom faces an uphill battle. He’s a Democrat running in Mississippi, with one of the most reliably conservative electorates in the nation. 
Mississippi last elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1982, when it reelected John Stennis. A majority of Mississippians have voted for the Republican nominee for president since 1980. 
Still, Colom said he can crack the GOP’s stronghold in the state because he has experience with pitching moderate and progressive solutions to a more conservative electorate, as he did when he defeated long-serving incumbent Forrest Allgood, an independent, for district attorney in 2015. 
“At the time, people didn’t think I could win the DA’s race,” Colom said. 
A native of Columbus, Colom is the elected district attorney of the 16th Circuit Court District, which includes Lowndes, Oktibbeha, Clay and Noxubee counties. He is the first Black DA for the district. 
He first won that election by casting his opponent as an incredibly harsh prosecutor who was more concerned with obtaining stiff sentences for convicted criminals than true rehabilitation. After Colom took office, he said he focused his office’s efforts on tackling violent crime and promoting alternative sentencing for nonviolent offenders. 
“I have faith that the truth always sees through if you get the message out, speak with conviction and lead with your values,” Colom said. “That’s my plan. I want to speak with my values.” 
For example, Colom said he would push for legislation that raises the nation’s minimum wage and exempts law enforcement officers and public school teachers from paying federal income taxes. 
This may be the first time the two have competed head-to-head, but it will not be the first time Colom and Hyde-Smith have butted heads. Former President Joe Biden in 2023 nominated Colom to a vacant federal judicial seat in northern Mississippi, but Hyde-Smith thwarted the nomination.

Despite support for Colom from Roger Wicker, Mississippi’s senior U.S. senator, Hyde-Smith was able to block his nomination because of a longstanding tradition in the U.S. Senate that requires senators from a nominee’s home state to submit “blue slips” if they approve of the candidate. 
Hyde-Smith never returned one of these slips for Colom. If both senators don’t submit a blue slip, the nominee typically does not advance to a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Hyde-Smith, at her reelection launch last week, mentioned her opposition to Colom’s elevation to the federal bench. 
“He thought he was going to be a federal judge, and I blocked him,” Hyde-Smith said to applause. 
Colom is the first Democrat to announce his candidacy for the Senate seat. Ty Pinkins, an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in 2024, has declared he’s also running for the Senate again in 2026 as an independent.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/02142215/IMG_4245.jpeg,,,2025-09-03 06:57:03.927843

(Photo by Leann Ray/West Virginia Watch)Along the way to falling in love with West Virginia and its culture and history, its rivers and valleys and yes, even its political underpinnings after I moved to the state when I was quite young, I credit the Mountain State as the primary reason why I began to write commentaries, stories, poetry and essays. 
And I credit the state’s leading magazine, Goldenseal — whose emphasis since 1975 revolves around West Virginia’s culture and history and her resilient people — for opening its pages to my work, whether it was a piece on the Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster, the emigration of my husband’s grandfather to West Virginia in the early 1900s, or a piece that chronicled my beginnings as a West Virginia author. It was an acceptance by Goldenseal that set me on that path over 30 years ago. 
The years to follow would lead to more acceptances from Goldenseal. Every single one was an honor. My undergraduate and graduate school advisor, Otis Rice, was considered to be the state’s leading historian. It was his introduction to Goldenseal that encouraged me to submit my work.
Each editor of Goldenseal — Ken Sullivan, John Lilly, Stan Bumgardner, and Laiken Blankenship — has always held the magazine to the highest editorial standards, accepting nothing less than excellence, achieving that goal with every single issue. As its founding editor, Tom Screven, wrote in the first issue, “the magazine also serves as a means of communication for students and enthusiasts of West Virginia’s folklife,” which just may be the richest in the land.
In a recent article by West Virginia Watch’s Lori Kersey, the West Virginia Department of Tourism is looking for ways to reduce costs and increase readership for Goldenseal. While these concerns are legitimate, the possibility that the magazine may no longer be available in print edition raises concern. 
At its height, it had more than 30,000 subscribers. That number now has dropped to fewer than 4,500 with the growing preference for digital media. The rising costs of printing and postage are also contributing factors to those declining numbers. Whether the magazine will close its print edition is a looming question. 
In a state and federal political climate that currently continues to focus less and less on the arts, the mere suggestion that Goldenseal’s print edition may no longer be held, its readers no longer physically turning its pages, and our bookshelves free of its aesthetic value is unsettling. West Virginia has many challenges. Let’s not close the door on a valuable asset that highlights all that is good and real about her: a history, a culture that consistently brings respect to those native to the state and those who are new to our state, who visit our parks and who experience our culture and who pick up Goldenseal to find out more of what defines West Virginia and its people.
Goldenseal grows naturally in much of the forested areas of West Virginia. Its bright yellow-colored root is dried and taken as a tonic, a stomach remedy, even used as a fabric dye. The herb was chosen as the magazine’s title because it represents “beneficial things that occur naturally in West Virginia” (e.g., its culture, history, arts & crafts, folklore, music, religion and yes, its storied politics). The state’s rich history cannot be diminished; it’s the base that forms its future. It fought too hard to plant those seeds, weathering its storms, and witnessing their growth only to watch them wither and die. We’re tougher than that, West Virginia. Regain your footing and voice your most certain opposition to all who threaten the growth and prosperity of what our history has produced that uplifts rather than dismantles.

(Getty Images)Whether or not you’ve ever needed it, Medicaid forms the bedrock of Kentucky’s entire health care system, making coverage more affordable and accessible for all of us. 
As our single largest source of federal funding, it also sustains thousands of jobs, keeps rural hospitals and clinics open, and injects billions into our local economies each year. 
Almost 1.5 million Kentuckians count on this coverage, from our youngest, to our oldest, and everyone in between, including working families, people with disabilities, and anyone who finds themselves in need of costly or long-term care they couldn’t otherwise afford.

Kentucky’s population is rapidly aging, which means more of us are discovering that it’s often Medicaid (not Medicare) that’s there when we need help with nursing care, home health or assisted living. As we weather the aging boom, Medicaid’s critical significance in our lives will only grow. 
Claiming to safeguard the future of the program, Congress has pushed through the largest cuts in Medicaid’s history. These “big, beautiful” cuts, rushed in over a few short weeks this summer, exceed the scale of all previous reductions combined. It has left many wondering how exactly the program is being protected.

The largest cuts from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) come from terminating coverage for people who can’t meet new work reporting requirements. Supporters of the change have worked hard to sell a particular stereotype, painting pictures of young men somehow living high off their health insurance. But that certainly isn’t the case in Kentucky.
In reality, the “able-bodied adults without dependents” these requirements target are most likely to be middle-aged women with a high school degree or less, who have caregiving responsibilities at home. Many are caring for a parent, sibling or spouse who may not legally count as a dependent, but whose needs keep them from fully participating in the workforce. In Kentucky, nearly 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees who aren’t working full-time are doing exactly that: providing essential care to their loved ones.

The image of a young man sitting in a basement playing video games distracts us from the reality of a single mom juggling elder care with whatever odd jobs she can squeeze in. These women aren’t gaming the system, they’re sustaining it. It is their often unrecognized and unpaid labor that saves millions in long-term care costs, yet the Big Beautiful Bill threatens to punish them for not fitting narrow reporting requirements.
But the new hurdles won’t stop there. They pile on paperwork, reporting deadlines, and exemption applications that overwhelm the very people Medicaid is meant to help. Working parents, gig workers, farmers and Kentuckians facing barriers like unreliable transportation, fluctuating hours or limited internet access will struggle to keep up.
The result? Coverage losses. These new requirements won’t boost employment, but they will double our rate of uninsured, strain our hospitals with uncompensated care and push more families into medical debt.

If lawmakers truly wanted to “save” Medicaid, they have options. Too many Kentuckians face a benefit cliff when increased earnings put them over the eligibility limit for Medicaid but aren’t enough to cover the cost of commercial insurance. Providers like dentists are woefully underpaid through base reimbursements. Life-changing medications are currently excluded from coverage. And quality care isn’t incentivized the way it should be.
Congress could have tackled any of these issues. Instead, the Big Beautiful Bill weakens Medicaid across the board, straining our entire health care infrastructure, reducing access and driving up costs for everyone. The truth is, Medicaid didn’t need saving. But it does now.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Medicaid-illustration-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-03 05:56:20.209205

Here in Colorado, billions of dollars of sales tax losses have created budget gaps in cities and counties across the state, from Weld to Pueblo to Montezuma.
Coloradans are more hesitant than ever to spend the money that could help counties recover missing revenue, due in part to fears of a potential recession and a lack of disposable income.
To spend more money, Coloradans need to make more money. Unfortunately, an essential investment in Colorado’s working families’ financial stability — and their ability to fuel our local economies — is at risk.

This month, Congress will vote on whether to fully appropriate funding for Head Start, the Child Care Development Fund, and Child Care Development Block Grants.
For almost a century, federally funded early childhood care and education programs like these have provided relief to Colorado’s working families and helped our nation’s children and workforce thrive. Unfortunately, recent threats to eliminate Head Start mean the future of these services is anything but certain. Their sustained success depends on significant congressional support.
Losing federal funding for child care and early childhood programs would not only endanger Colorado’s children and families, but also the financial future of Colorado’s local and state economies. Currently, Colorado loses approximately $3.8 billion in annual tax revenue because families do not have a safe place for their children to go while they work — an amount that would more than fill the revenue gap legislators just held a special session to address.
The link between child care, workforce and revenue is clear in rural areas, like Montezuma County. Officials there are grappling with a multiyear revenue shortfall that recently led to defunding the sheriff’s office. One reason for these economic struggles is the county’s troubling number of unfilled construction and health care jobs. At the same time, the cost of child care in Montezuma is an unaffordable 36% of the average family’s income. Without a safe place to leave their children, many county residents cannot work or attain the upskilling they need to move into higher-paying vacancies. Their lack of spending power limits the sales tax revenue the county desperately needs to close budget gaps.
Across the state, affordability is a huge barrier to accessing care. The average cost of center-based infant care in Colorado is more than $20,000 annually. This cost is more than 40% of the median income for single-parent families in our state. Toddler care costs nearly as much.
In some parts of the state, families cannot access care because seats simply do not exist. This lack of availability has serious economic consequences. Adams County, which is currently slashing essential services like education and firefighting due to revenue gaps, has less than a third of the child care seats necessary to meet residents’ needs. Other local communities face similar dilemmas.
Imagine how much revenue these governments are leaving on the table because residents don’t have access to child care. Investing in child care is not just good for families. It’s also good for economies. Few public investments pay off as lucratively as child care. Early childhood education and care programs like Head Start yield $7 for every $1 invested. They also improve high school graduation rates, reduce incarceration rates, and improve health outcomes. All of these contribute to long-term economic self-sufficiency.
The business community also increasingly recognizes the benefits of investing in child care: A recent Boston Consulting Group study showed that companies that paid for employees’ child care saw  a 90% to 425% return on investment. Numbers like these make it clear that investing in child care is a sound decision.
Congress shouldn’t make a challenging situation worse by making it even harder for families to access child care. It is more important than ever that Colorado’s representatives and leaders support access to child care. Our children, our families, and our local economies cannot afford anything less.

(Photo courtesy of LifeWise Academy)In the past month or so, federal courts have dealt a string of blows to conservatives’ push for the biblical Ten Commandments to be posted in public schools.
Yet as states lose over required religious displays, many are working on another route to faith-based education by allowing kids to attend off-campus religious instruction. This year, Iowa, Montana, Ohio and Texas passed laws guaranteeing parents the right to have their children excused during the school day for free, off-campus religious instruction, often called “released time.”
Those four states are the latest of at least 12 that require school districts to offer released time religious schooling upon parental request, including: Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wisconsin.
The released time approach may be more likely to pass constitutional muster than other government-imposed religious efforts, experts say, by shifting influence off school grounds and under the direction of faith-based groups rather than public school teachers, and by making it free to students.
A 1952 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Zorach v. Clauson allows for released time religious instruction as long as it’s off school property, privately funded and parent permitted.
“Not every family has access to private or parochial school, but for many generations families have been able to take their students out of school for a portion of the day for religious education if they choose,” said Jennifer Jury, a program advocate for LifeWise Academy, an Ohio-based Christian nonprofit founded in 2018.
The organization has been active in expanding its reach and lobbying lawmakers for stronger legislative support. This school year, LifeWise expects to serve nearly 100,000 public school students across 1,100 schools in 34 states, Jury said.
The off-campus gatherings work the same way in most states: With parents’ approval, public school students sign out of school during a lunch, recess or study hall block. Students will either walk or ride one of the distinctive red LifeWise buses to a local church or a program-leased community building in town.
And depending on state limitations for the religious instruction, for either a half or full hour, kids will learn about the Bible. When the allotted time is up, students go back to their public school to finish the day.
In some states, students can earn academic credit for the off-campus instruction, which has been more controversial.
In Montana, for example, legislation that would have required school districts to develop policies for academic credit was amended to “authorize” a district to allow credit, after pushback from the state’s school boards and school administrators associations.
“School districts should have the autonomy to determine which external coursework aligns with the academic frameworks and whether such courses should be eligible for credit,” Rob Watson, who represented the two groups at the legislature, said in his comments to a House committee in February. He noted the groups did not oppose the released time policy itself.
Despite the changes, only one Democrat in the legislature voted “yes.” Montana GOP Gov. Greg Gianforte signed the bill into law in May.
Supporters had touted the academic credit option as a way to entice homeschooling families to consider public schools. In her interview with Stateline, Jury noted similar programs that accommodate Jewish, Muslim and Mormon faith-based teaching for public school students.
“Whether a person is religious or not, the Bible is widely recognized as one of the most influential books in history,” Jury said. “A lot of our Western culture was born out of ideas that come from the Bible, like the fact that every person is created equal, that we are to love our neighbor.”
Identical bill language
The conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, known as ALEC, in August adopted model legislation about released time policies that state lawmakers can propose.
ALEC’s proposal would allow from one to five hours per week of off-campus religious instruction and would require school districts to award academic credit if the course meets certain criteria. Districts would have to assess instruction based on secular standards and would not be allowed to test for particular religious content, according to the model legislation.
Nearly identical language had already appeared in several state bills, including in North Carolina and West Virginia this year and in Mississippi in 2023. In North Carolina, LifeWise Academy registered with the secretary of state’s office in 2024, as reported by NC Newsline, and a released time bill was introduced in February. It was sent to committee but never moved ahead.
The bills in Mississippi and West Virginia also stalled.
Legislation that does become law earns praise from groups such as Alliance Defending Freedom, one of the nation’s most active legal organizations opposing abortion rights and same-sex marriage.
Statements from Greg Chafuen, senior counsel for the nonprofit’s Center for Public Policy, say the new released time laws respect “parents’ educational decisions” and ensure “parents are in the driver’s seat when it comes to their kids’ education.”
An Indiana law lets high school students leave school for religious instruction each week for an amount of time equal to one elective course. Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee laws allow students to earn elective credit for released time religious instruction, though it cannot replace a “core curriculum” class. School boards can set standards for when such programs qualify for credit.
LifeWise operates in each of those states.
Ten Commandment displays
Jury, of LifeWise Academy, said her organization wants off-campus religious options for public school students to be available in all 50 states.
“It’s important to note this is an option, and parents are the ultimate decision-makers in enrollment,” she said.
“We would love to see every student in the United States have the option to attend a program like LifeWise if they want to and if their parents want them to.”
A lack of parental choice might be what trips up state efforts to post the Ten Commandments in classrooms.

After Louisiana last year became the first state in recent decades to require that the Ten Commandments, a central tenet of the Judeo-Christian tradition, be displayed in school classrooms, bills followed in at least 15 other states. Two states — Arkansas and Texas — enacted laws.
But for now, courts have blocked the mandates in all three states. In Texas, U.S. District Judge Fred Biery warned the displays “are likely to pressure [children] into religious observance” and undermine parents’ rights.
In Arkansas, U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks called the state’s requirement to post a specific version of the Ten Commandments “plainly unconstitutional.”
The law “is not neutral with respect to religion,” he wrote. “By design, and on its face, the statute mandates the display of expressly religious scripture in every public-school classroom and library.”
He also noted that the law “requires that a specific version of that scripture be used, one that the uncontroverted evidence in this case shows is associated with Protestantism and is exclusionary of other faiths.”

Both lawmakers expressed frustration with some hospital chains in Virginia for not speaking out about how the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” reconciliation bill that Congress passed this summer will impact health care providers and patients in the state. 
“They’re trying to bury their heads in the sand,” Warner said of some health systems operating in the commonwealth. “They want to lobby me and the Speaker for help behind closed doors, but don’t want to go out and be transparent with their community.” 
Scott concurred. The men surmised that hospital leadership may be feeling “intimidated” by President Donald Trump’s administration, which has spearheaded a campaign to reduce government spending that has upended several agencies and led large swaths of federal workers to lose their jobs, including thousands in Virginia. 
Referencing Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan, Scott said “the greatness of this country will only be maintained if we’re willing to speak truth to each other.” 
Both on the panel in Franklin — an hour and a half southeast of Richmond — and in an interview with The Mercury, Warner singled out Bon Secours, which the area’s operates Southampton Memorial Hospital, one of six hospitals in the state that could be at higher risk of service cuts or closure when health care components of Congress’ reconciliation bill take effect. 
When The Mercury reached out to Bon Secours about Southampton earlier this summer, a public relations person referred the newsroom to the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association. The entity includes several health systems around the state and at times speaks on their behalf.  In June, VHHA had joined several similar associations in other states to write a letter to Congress urging them to block the U.S.Senate’s version of the reconciliation bill before it ultimately passed and was signed into law by Trump on July 4. 
Aside from the letter, leaders from hospitals have made visits to Washington, D.C. to meet with federal lawmakers and the White House. VHHA spokesman Julian Walker said in an email that the association and hospitals have “consistently shared our perspective” about how the bill could cause hundreds of thousands to lose health coverage and a projected “$2 billion annually in essential hospital funding.” 
While Bon Secours hasn’t spoken about the imminent changes publicly, Ballad Health leaders have spoken out. 
“Obviously it’s a huge concern for us,” Lee County Community Hospital administrator Cindy Elkins told The Mercury during a visit this summer to the facility deep in the mountains of Southwest Virginia. 
A once-shuttered facility, Ballad Health took over and reopened the hospital in 2021. On a recent tour, Elkins explained how the facility has been able to add new services incrementally over time to serve some needs of the rural communities it serves.  
While still vulnerable to the loss of Medicaid-insured patients, the hospital’s special reimbursement rate through its designation as a Critical Access Hospital is expected to cushion some of the reconciliation bill’s blow. 
Ballad Health’s Chief Operating Officer Eric Deaton also spelled out that the forthcoming changes are “pretty scary.” 
He predicts Ballad could lose around $25 million in the first year the reconciliation bill’s hospital funding changes take effect. Ballad is one of the chains that has a footprint in rural areas, which can be less profitable for hospitals and make operating margins small, but which Deaton said is “a calling” for some physicians and hospitals. 
“We’re very concerned, and we’re really focused on, ‘what can we do to work with our legislators in the future?’” he said. 
Ballad Health CEO Alan Levine was also critical of the reconciliation bill on social media as it worked its way through Congress — at one point, writing that it “will lead to closure of rural hospitals.”
 More uninsured Virginians, fewer health care workers and services

How the reconciliation bill’s changes will take shape in Virginia depend on a series of interconnected federal funding changes. One is a set of federal funding mechanisms that are critical to hospital operation, while the other changes stem from forthcoming Medicaid shifts outlined in the federal legislation.  
Of Virginia’s roughly 1.9 million people on Medicaid, about 600,000 of the people who became eligible when the program was expanded in 2018 could potentially lose coverage. 
Then there’s the potential for Congress to not renew special tax credits that help people purchase insurance on the ACA Marketplace, which may cause some to forgo purchasing plans next year altogether. About 400,000 Virginians purchase health insurance on the marketplace, with the credits applying to those that earn between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level. 
Uninsured people are less likely to seek preventative care and wait for dire emergencies to get help. That care can become costlier and hospitals will absorb it for a time, but will also find ways to offset costs. 
Aside from reducing staff and services or closing facilities, hospitals do occasionally negotiate with private insurers, which means that those rates are likely to rise in the future.
“They’re going to drive up all of our rates,” Warner said Tuesday in Franklin. “This will drive up healthcare costs for all of us — rich, poor, middle class and anywhere in between.”
 Passing the message

Tuesday’s panel included area doctors, healthcare advocates, and local government officials who strategized how to best communicate and prepare Virginians for the  changes coming from the new federal law. 
Scott said that city councilors and boards of supervisors can play a key role in educating people, to which Franklin Mayor Paul Kaplan nodded. Mona Murphy, a local public school employee, noted that the local hospital is a “fundamental pillar” of the local workforce. Its potential closure or downsizing would leave people without jobs, a point that is essential for the public to understand, she said. 
An audience member suggested state lawmakers explore requiring hospitals that plan to close down to fund an urgent care center in their absence. Scott said he “liked the idea,” but noted that hospitals that end up closing could also explore converting themselves into an urgent care center. 
For now, he said that Virginia could tap into its budget surplus, but as a short-term fix, it would be “wiped away with the stroke of a pen.”
When passing the reconciliation bill, Congress also passed the Rural Health Transformation Program, which Walker from VHHA acknowledged was meant to “soften the (the reconciliation bill’s) impact on patients and providers.”
He added that that the association’s “outreach continues today as we engage with state and federal officials” regarding the program. In Virginia, state and local agencies are already preparing for how to roll out the changes.
Scott and Warner criticized Congress’ Republican majority for delaying the start date on health care changes in the reconciliation bill until after next year’s congressional midterm elections. Between now and then, Warner said he is hopeful that the nation’s legislative body can consider unraveling some of those changes. More immediately, however, he plans to urge his colleagues across the aisle to to renew the ACA tax credits so hundreds of thousands of Virginians won’t lose their health care insurance.
“I do think a lot of my Republican friends realize that the big bill went too far,” he said. “So maybe I think we can get some agreement there.”

(Photo courtesy of LifeWise Academy)In the past month or so, federal courts have dealt a string of blows to conservatives’ push for the biblical Ten Commandments to be posted in public schools.
Yet as states lose over required religious displays, many are working on another route to faith-based education by allowing kids to attend off-campus religious instruction. This year, Iowa, Montana, Ohio and Texas passed laws guaranteeing parents the right to have their children excused during the school day for free, off-campus religious instruction, often called “released time.”
Those four states are the latest of at least 12 that require school districts to offer released time religious schooling upon parental request, including: Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wisconsin.
The released time approach may be more likely to pass constitutional muster than other government-imposed religious efforts, experts say, by shifting influence off school grounds and under the direction of faith-based groups rather than public school teachers, and by making it free to students.
A 1952 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Zorach v. Clauson allows for released time religious instruction as long as it’s off school property, privately funded and parent permitted.
“Not every family has access to private or parochial school, but for many generations families have been able to take their students out of school for a portion of the day for religious education if they choose,” said Jennifer Jury, a program advocate for LifeWise Academy, an Ohio-based Christian nonprofit founded in 2018.
The organization has been active in expanding its reach and lobbying lawmakers for stronger legislative support. This school year, LifeWise expects to serve nearly 100,000 public school students across 1,100 schools in 34 states, Jury said.
The off-campus gatherings work the same way in most states: With parents’ approval, public school students sign out of school during a lunch, recess or study hall block. Students will either walk or ride one of the distinctive red LifeWise buses to a local church or a program-leased community building in town.

Glenn Youngkin speaking with reporters on April 8, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)After a Democratic-controlled Senate committee rejected 14 of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s appointments to university boards last Thursday, the governor’s office blasted the lawmakers in a letter Friday, labeling the committees’ actions as “unprecedented attempts to intimidate board members” that have harmed Virginia institutions of higher learning. 
The missive, dated Aug. 29, is the latest turn in an ongoing battle between Youngkin, who as governor has the authority to add and remove people to Virginia college boards, and Democratic legislators, who have bucked the governor’s picks over concerns about their backgrounds and ideological positions, and who have the power to confirm or reject board appointees.
Senate committee Democrats block 14 more Youngkin appointees from Va. college boards

Last week, Democrats on the Senate Privileges & Elections Committee rejected 14 more appointments, bringing the total number they’ve blocked this year to 22.
The Democratic lawmakers said they are trying to protect institutions from partisan attacks, including those launched after President Donald Trump’s administration initiated several investigations into Virginia’s universities, primarily the University of Virginia and George Mason University. 
The governor’s administration has filed an appeal with the Supreme Court to lift a temporary suspension on the appointments for three governing boards at Virginia’s higher education institutions brought forward by Senate Democrats. The administration doubled down on that course in the Aug. 29 letter. 
Members of the administration wrote that the Democrats’ actions are counterproductive, and the letter, signed by the governor’s chief of staff, John Littel, and counsel Richard Cullen, expressed confidence that the Supreme Court will remind the Senate committee of its role in the confirmation process.
“While claiming to care so deeply about Virginia’s prestigious institutions of higher education, your actions have consistently caused harm to the governance and operation of our colleges and universities,” the letter states. “Your unprecedented attempts to intimidate board members threaten the best-in-class governance that we have worked so hard to build. And, at the same time, you ask the governor to abdicate his constitutional and statutory duty to ensure that our colleges are properly governed. The request is so illogical it does not bear addressing.”
The response from the governor’s office is a rebuttal to an earlier letter from Senate Democratic leadership — Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, and Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Mamie Locke, D-Hampton — sent before the Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections met last week and rejected 14 of Youngkin’s appointees on boards at the Virginia Military Institute (VMI), the University of Virginia (UVA) and its affiliates, and George Mason University (GMU). Youngkin made the appointments to fill vacant positions. 
In the letter, Senate leaders urged the governor to suspend any further appointments to Virginia’s university governing boards and said some of Youngkin’ appointees have introduced additional “controversy” and “division,” and have “abdicated” their responsibilities. 
They wrote that Virginia’s universities need members who “unite rather than divide,” possess relevant experience in higher education governance, and are committed to protecting academic freedom and institutional integrity.
The rebuttal from Youngkin’s office did not specify whether the governor would suspend making any further appointments.
Democrats, Wilder defend Va.’s top-ranked higher education system amid Trump investigations

Instead, the governor’s team criticized the committee’s claims and questioned its authority, asserting that the General Assembly has not rejected any of the appointments and that the appointees are “eminently qualified.”
The letter detailed some of the backgrounds of the appointments including a former president and CEO of Mastercard International, a vice chairman of Goldman Sachs, a former acting Federal Trade Commission chairwoman, a decorated Marine Corps officer, former members of the General Assembly, a former Attorney General of Virginia, and a former U.S. Assistant Attorney General. 
These individuals bring “deep experience in government, law, corporate leadership, military service, and university governance,” the letter states.
The governor’s administration argues that the appointees are allowed to continue serving until the General Assembly reconvenes in January, when the full body of legislators can thoroughly review the qualifications and financial interests of the appointments.
On Monday, Surovell didn’t appear surprised that the governor’s office denounced his colleagues’ work to block appointees.
“The lights are on at our house, but one of the things we’ve learned in the last three and half years is that the governor doesn’t have a lot of interest in working with the legislature on anything,” Surovell said. “The Trump administration’s assault on our institutions of higher education is going to be our problem a lot longer than his, and I’d hope he’d work with us on defending our schools.”
In the next legislative session, Democrats are considering introducing an amendment to the state code that would specify that gubernatorial appointments cannot take effect until confirmed by the General Assembly.

(Photo illustration by iStock/Getty Images Plus)Is good customer service important? Think of the relief you get when someone helps you exchange a poorly fitting dress or reverse a faulty charge. Now imagine when you’re at risk of being evicted or going a month without money for groceries.
That’s the kind of customer service I do. I work for Social Security Administration in Wilkes Barre.
Every day, my colleagues and I in Pennsylvania and across the country make sure people receive their benefits or stay enrolled in Medicare. We are proud of our work, but because of the administration’s decisions, our morale is as low as it has ever been. What called to me as a job of service is now a fight for survival.
Last month, Social Security turned 90 years old. Unlike many New Deal programs, it wasn’t just a short-term fix while the economy turned around. It provided stability for aging, disabled and unemployed Americans when it was passed, and it established our best long-term tool to fight poverty.
Today it’s a cherished, protected part of Americans’ lives. Officials across the political spectrum have kept its promise to seniors and people who no longer have the ability to work that they can retire and thrive with dignity.
Now that promise is under siege.
The Trump administration has proposed changes to the way Social Security is provided that are already harming seniors, preventing workers from helping them, and degrading vital lifelines.
The administration has made the largest staffing cut in Social Security’s history, indiscriminately cutting more than 7,000 positions, including those with the most experience and knowledge. The staffing changes to Social Security have left the commonwealth and 45 other states with fewer field staff between March 2024 and 2025. As of  this past March, there were over 2,700 Social Security workers in Pennsylvania.
Here in the commonwealth, where years of physically demanding work in our state’s heavy industrial economy has left many of us permanently unable to work, it has become increasingly difficult for Americans to count on the payments they’ve earned their whole lives to show up on time. With years of record inflation leaving prices higher than ever before, the difference between an empty bank account and an on-time check has never been more stark.
If you’ve got a problem, new restrictions require you to show up in person at a field office in Pennsylvania. That can mean a long journey for someone whose mobility is limited by age or disability. Under the administration’s first plan, an estimated 5.3 million additional in-person visits would be expected this year.
And what help can we offer them when they show up? For Social Security representatives after the staffing cuts, each day brings its own heartbreak. Resolving healthcare expenses is especially dire; my colleagues field calls from people whose Medicare payments have stopped, leaving them to choose between paying their rent and risking their health or paying their medical bills and facing eviction.
Tens of thousands of people are waiting for Medicare Part B enrollment, meaning they are likely not getting the health coverage they need.
There’s no cheap technological fix for this problem. My colleagues are the boots on the ground who get the work done. Juggling spillover work, denied flexible schedules, unable to take time off for medical appointments, we are blocked from providing the service Americans deserve. Some of us draw down paid time off just to be able to bring their children to daycare. We’re long past robbing Peter to pay Paul.
Social Security’s not perfect.
We want to improve services and get people better help quicker. We have joined labor-management partnerships. We’ve recommended updates. But staffing cuts and reckless policy changes won’t help anyone retire with dignity or make government efficient.
They’ll only do what Trump’s head of the Office of Management and Budget envisioned for government workers: “We want to put them in trauma.”
It’s working.
In the 1937 Supreme Court decision that declared Social Security constitutional, Justice Benjamin Cardozo wrote, “The hope behind this statute is to save men and women from the rigors of the poor house, as well as from the haunting fear that such a lot awaits them when journey’s end is near.”
That’s a lot to put on the shoulders of anyone but that’s what my colleagues in the Social Security Administration do every day.
Will you help us keep that promise?

(Courtesy of the University of New Hampshire's Center for Sustainable Seafood Systems)Mike Coogan has been doing aquaculture, or fish farming, formally for over a decade. Informally — through at-home hobby fish tanks and aquariums — he’s been doing it much longer.
Now, he’s joined a legislative effort to streamline the regulatory process for aquaculture in an effort to create a U.S. industry.
Coogan is a researcher at the University of New Hampshire, where he works on the school’s AquaFort, a pilot project where researchers are growing steelhead trout in the mouth of the Piscataqua River near New Castle.

“We have a tiny, tiny coastline, just 18 miles,” he said of the Granite State. “But we do a lot of interesting work, and have been sort of leaders in offshore aquaculture or open ocean aquaculture for the last 25 and change years.”
The fish farm uses a method called multitrophic aquaculture, which means they grow different species together, in small 20-by-20-foot underwater cages with 15-foot nets, Coogan said. They line the perimeter of the farm with sugar kelp and blue mussels to create “a biological curtain” to absorb nutrients and prevent disease. UNH is the only university growing fish in the ocean, he said.
UNH’s fish farm and others like it are far from a large-scale industry though. Aquaculture produces only 7% of domestic seafood in the U.S., according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Roughly 70% to 85% of seafood in the U.S. is imported, and it’s estimated half of that comes from aquaculture, per the NOAA. Aquaculture in the U.S. largely consists of catfish farms across the South. In New England, oysters and other shellfish are farmed. Coogan said the New Hampshire oyster farms are limited, with only a little over a dozen operating in Great Bay and Little Bay near Portsmouth and estuaries near Hampton.
“But we don’t have a lot of marine fin-fish aquaculture, and we have no fin fish being grown in federal water,” Coogan said, adding that federal water is any water three miles off the coastline.
He said the reason for this limited industry is the complex regulatory landscape, and pointed to efforts from colleagues at the University of Southern Mississippi as an example.
“They’ve been trying to get a farm for 20 years, and they’re still waiting on it,” he said. “And that’s sort of the story everywhere. It’s just really challenging to even know what to do. There are so many regulatory bodies that are involved in that process.”

That’s why Coogan joined the Coalition for Sustainable Aquaculture, which is currently making a push in Congress for the bipartisan MARA Act, which seeks to streamline the regulatory process and allow for a U.S. aquaculture industry.
Coogan said the U.S. is the only developed coastal country in the world without a significant aquaculture industry. The MARA Act would do multiple things aimed at changing that. It would create demonstration farms to be studied for their impact on the ocean and most effective methods. It would establish the Office of Aquaculture within the NOAA and designate it as the regulatory agency for permitting these projects rather than a hodgepodge of disparate government agencies. And it would commission studies to evaluate how the industry is doing and its impact.
In late June, Coogan and a group of fish farmers, fishermen, and seafood chefs traveled to Washington, D.C., to advocate for the legislation. The bill has been introduced and is being considered by the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. Congress members returned to the Capitol this week after a six-week recess.
“The path to a responsible open ocean aquaculture industry in the U.S. must have its foundations in science, research, and community engagement,” Maddie Voorhees, with the Coalition for Sustainable Aquaculture and the Environmental Defense Fund, said in a statement to the Bulletin. “This bill is an important step toward harnessing scientific innovation and sound environmental practices to meet our seafood needs while protecting marine ecosystems.”
Proponents of aquaculture point to the state of the world’s oceans, which are being depleted through overfishing. This has caused serious consequences for both the environment and the fishing industry. That’s especially true in coastal New England. Coogan noted at one point the Northeast “was the fishing capital of the world.”
“Cape Cod is called Cape Cod for a reason,” Coogan said. “They said you used to be able to walk on the backs of cod, and there were cod the size of a grown man.”
There were also abundant haddock and tuna, among others. However, now it’s almost entirely lobster because ground fish — natural predators of lobsters — were overfished.
Coogan sees aquaculture as a way to mitigate overfishing, both reducing damage to the ecosystem and allowing traditional fishing to be sustainable. He sees aquaculture not as a complete replacement to fishing, but a supplement.
“When I was introduced to aquaculture as a means to produce seafood, it seemed like a pretty straightforward concept,” he said. “Just an equation. If you’re pulling less fish out of the ocean and producing more in a more controlled environment, then you can alleviate the stress of wild fisheries and have a lot more control on what you’re producing locally.”
However, aquaculture has historically faced pushback from the fishing industry, which sees it as a threat.
In Alaska, for example, where fishing is a tentpole of the economy, fin fish farming is outlawed, with opponents of aquaculture saying the state needs to be able to market its industry as “wild caught.” Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy faced intense pushback from fishermen last month when he proposed lifting the ban, floating on social media, “Why not do both (fishing and farming) instead of importing farmed salmon from Scotland?” the Anchorage Daily News reported.
Coogan, on the other hand, thinks support is growing for aquaculture.
“We’ve been waiting for something like this to happen for quite a while, and it’s sort of happening in conjunction with a lot of other really good things for aquaculture,” he said. “So it seems like it is sort of a turning point.”
The MARA Act will need to be approved in committee before it can be considered by the full Senate.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/steelheadtrout.png,,,2025-09-03 05:56:20.209205

Santiago/Getty Images)More police agencies, from big-city departments to federal agencies, are lowering education standards for new recruits — a sign of how much the profession is changing as it struggles to recruit and retain officers.
This year, at least two major city agencies — the New York Police Department and the Dallas Police Department — have cut some education requirements for new recruits.
In February, the NYPD reduced its college credit requirement for police academy entry from 60 credits to 24. Following a new policy approval in June, the Dallas Police Department began allowing applicants with only a high school diploma or GED to qualify if they also have three consecutive years of full-time work experience.
Police agencies nationwide are loosening education requirements in an effort to address years of staffing shortages. The changes also come as President Donald Trump has drawn more attention to crime and public safety by deploying the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, and signaling plans to expand federal enforcement efforts in Chicago and other cities. (A federal judge on Tuesday ruled Trump’s mobilization of U.S. Marines and the California National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles this summer violated federal law.) Trump also has taken over the District of Columbia’s police department.
Stigma still keeps police from seeking mental health care, study finds

Reports of violent crime nationwide have been decreasing since 2022. Some communities, though, are still facing higher rates of certain crimes, including homicide.
The changes in New York City and Dallas are part of a yearslong trend of police departments easing college requirements, a shift that includes Boise, Idaho; Chicago; Louisville, Kentucky; New Orleans; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Memphis, Tennessee; and Bellingham, Washington. Even some state police agencies, such as the Kentucky State Police and the Pennsylvania State Police, have followed suit.
But these changes in education requirements aren’t limited to local and state forces. The FBI — which for decades required a four-year degree — will no longer mandate one for new recruits starting in October. New recruits also will receive just eight weeks of training, down from the previous 18-week standard, according to The New York Times.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also has loosened standards as the Trump administration seeks to expand immigration enforcement. The agency removed its five-week Spanish-language training requirement. Translation needs would instead be met through unspecified technology, The Intercept reported.
ICE has paired these changes with aggressive incentives, including signing bonuses of up to $50,000, as much as $60,000 in student loan repayment and retirement benefits.
These changes reflect a broader challenge in policing: Agencies are still struggling to recruit and retain officers amid increased public attention and shifting workforce expectations.
“The demand exceeds the supply, and what’s happened is the environment for being a police officer has changed,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a national nonprofit think tank on policing standards. “The expectations have never been higher.”
Resignations and retirements rose sharply after 2020, when nationwide protests put law enforcement under closer public scrutiny following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. Additionally, some officers are leaving big-city departments for smaller agencies. At the same time, some experts say, police agencies are competing in a tight labor market in which shift jobs may be less appealing than positions with regular hours, higher pay or remote work options.
In recent years, the push for better-educated officers has been rooted in research suggesting that college graduates are less likely to use force and perform better on the job. But some say that strict education mandates can shrink the applicant pool and shouldn’t be the sole measure of what makes a good officer.

“College education, in the greater scheme of things, is advantageous. It’s necessary, but not sufficient,” Wexler said, noting that agencies should also weigh a recruit’s work history, maturity, judgement and other characteristics.
Agencies of all sizes also have adjusted other standards to attract more applicants — raising or lowering minimum age limits, loosening tattoo policies, scaling back fitness tests and waiving exam fees.
In some departments, these changes have sparked a surge in applications, but they haven’t always translated into higher staffing levels overall.
Following the NYPD’s announcement in February that it was changing its education requirement, daily applications jumped from an average of 53 to 231, according to a news release. In early August, the agency swore in 1,093 recruits — its largest incoming class since January 2016.
The New Orleans Police Department nixed its college education requirement in 2015 and saw a surge of 7,440 applications just two years later.
But hiring never kept pace: The department brought on about 100 recruits a year, and far fewer after 2020, according to the city’s hiring dashboard. In 2024, the department received 1,575 applications and hired just 35 recruits.
A report from the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s office released late last year found that between 2019 and 2023, the department lost nearly 27% of its policing staff.
Solving the staffing crisis
Staffing shortfalls have been a long-standing challenge for law enforcement agencies, stretching back well before 2020. But in recent years, hiring has improved in some parts of the country.
The latest Police Executive Research Forum survey, based on responses from 217 agencies across 39 states and the District of Columbia, suggests staffing trends are uneven.
As of Jan. 1, sworn staffing was up slightly from the year before but still 5.2% below 2020 levels, according to the survey. Large departments saw modest growth in 2024 but still employ 6% fewer officers than in 2020, while medium and small agencies have not just recovered but now surpass 2020 levels.
“This period we’re in now, and we have been in for the last few years, is the most challenging time to hire a police officer,” Wexler said.
Stigma still keeps police from seeking mental health care, study finds

In recent years, state legislatures also have looked into the education requirements for police. In 2023, for example, Oregon lawmakers considered a bill that would have required at least two years of higher education for departments with fewer than 50 officers and a bachelor’s degree for departments with more than 50. It would have applied to police, corrections, parole, probation and reserve officers, but the bill stalled in a Senate committee.
More recently, lawmakers in California are considering a bill that would, starting in 2031, require incoming officers to obtain a policing certificate, associate degree or bachelor’s degree within 36 months of graduating from a police academy. Incoming officers could also meet the requirement through prior military service or out-of-state law enforcement experience.
The proposal has received widespread support from many law enforcement agencies and groups in the state, including the California Police Chiefs Association, California State Sheriffs’ Association and the Peace Officers Research Association of California.
The sheriffs’ association praised the legislation, writing in a statement that it offers a range of acceptable experiences — “enhancing academic rigor” — without burdensome requirements that could hurt agencies’ recruiting goals.
Police education requirements are often set by individual departments or local jurisdictions, rather than written into state law. Across the country, most local law enforcement agencies require only a high school diploma or GED, though officers with a college degree may have more opportunities for promotions and higher pay.
“Educational standards across law enforcement agencies vary considerably,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University.
Some agencies also have created pathways for new officers to earn college credit through completing the police academy program and offer tuition reimbursement for those who want to pursue advanced degrees.
But La Vigne told Stateline that in-service training, organizational structure, leadership and accountability mechanisms within a department also play a key role in shaping a well-rounded officer.
“Those factors, I think, override anything as simple as ‘We’re requiring or removing education as a threshold for employment,’” La Vigne said. “Educational requirements alone are not the biggest factor.”
What makes a good cop
What makes a good police officer has long been debated, with discussions often centering on the role of education, training and personal qualities.










Having a college education by itself doesn’t mean you will be a better police officer.


– Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Research Executive Forum


Some argue that, rather than lowering education requirements, departments should improve people’s perceptions of the police by becoming more involved in the community, especially at a time when heightened scrutiny has made the job less appealing to some.
“It’s trying to fix the problem assuming that the way things work now is the way things are supposed to be,” said Jim Nolan, a sociology professor at West Virginia University and a speaker with the nonprofit Law Enforcement Action Partnership. Nolan previously served as a police officer and as an FBI unit chief. “It’s the approach to policing that’s wrong.”
Some research suggests that college-educated officers use force less often, face fewer complaints and are disciplined less frequently than their peers without a degree. Some policing experts say a college education may give officers a broader perspective on a range of issues while also strengthening critical thinking and teamwork skills.
Research also suggests that college-educated officers are stronger writers, which can lead to clearer investigations and casework, according to a 2017 report on higher education in policing.
But some experts still caution that the research is not conclusive and argue that education alone isn’t enough to determine what makes a good police officer.
“Having a college education by itself doesn’t mean you will be a better police officer,” said Wexler, of the Police Executive Research Forum.

More than 5,110 NIH grants have been impacted, totaling $4.52 billion lost, according to Grant Witness. 1,290 grants have been reinstated. 
The United States Supreme Court recently allowed NIH to terminate $783 million in grants tied to diversity initiatives.
NIH ended hundreds of grants linked to DEI studies earlier this year after a series of Trump executive orders. Two separate groups of plaintiffs went to federal court in Massachusetts to challenge the termination of the NIH grants and a federal judge ruled in their favor, but U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the Supreme Court to intervene. 
Ohio’s affected grants, according to Grant Witness.

Case Western Reserve University has nine grants affected, including one that could be possibly reinstated.
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center has two grants affected.
Kent State University has one grant affected.
Ohio State University has 18 grants, including six that could be possibly reinstated and one with frozen funding.
The Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital has three grants affected.
The University of Cincinnati has six grants affected, including one that could be possibly reinstated.
The University of Toledo has one grant affected.

The Ohio Capital Journal reached out to all affected universities and hospitals, but most of them did not respond by deadline. 
“We have not experienced the sweeping reductions in funding that have been proposed for some other institutions,” Ohio State University Spokesperson Ben Johnson said in an email. “When you look across our entire portfolio, we have not had a significant number of grants canceled. However, each cancellation is significant to the researchers involved and we are working to support those individuals.”
Ohio State’s research portfolio totaled $1.6 billion last year and about $775 million of that was federal funding, he said. 
The University of Toledo acknowledged a NIH grant was terminated and university spokesperson Tyrel Linkhorn said there were no layoffs associated with the termination. 
In addition, Ohio University has been notified of two NIH sub-awards totaling $13,040 that have received stop-work orders, university spokesperson Dan Pittman said. 
“Ohio University leaders will continue to assess evolving guidance from federal agencies and provide additional details and guidance as needed; during this time, we encourage all (OU) researchers to continue their efforts to explore research opportunities and to pursue funding,” he said in an email.
The types of NIH grants affected in Ohio range from studying the long-term effects of COVID, vaccine hesitancy in rural communities, inflammatory bowel disease, bisexual adolescents’ and young adults’ risk for depression and suicidal ideation, minority women’s mental health and creating healthy habits for heart health, among others. 
“The cuts to the NIH funding … are going to severely reduce the amount of research that universities in Ohio are able to engage in,” Sara Kilpatrick, executive director of the Ohio Conference of the American Association of University Professors. “And this, of course, is a problem nationwide, but this is a great concern for our research institutions in the state of Ohio.” 
This will hurt local economies and Ohio’s economy as a whole, she said. 
“I think that anybody who understands the kind of economic engines that our universities are has to be able to see the way that this is going to severely undermine the research missions of our universities,” Kilpatrick said.

As if the agony of his horrific injury weren't enough, I’ve also been forced to wage another relentless battle—this one against a cold, indifferent private health insurance industry that treats my son like a number instead of a life worth fighting for. 
The post A mother’s plea: Fix the broken continuum of care for brain injury survivors  appeared first on[...]","NEARLY TWO YEARS ago, my son Aidan’s life — and, as a result, our family’s life — changed forever.  
A devastating car crash left Aidan with multiple severe brain injuries. He is now 20, unable to speak or walk and dependent on a feeding tube. 
After 10 surgeries and nearly 80 days in a surgical intensive care unit, Aidan was discharged from an acute care hospital to rehabilitation for the first time in March of 2024. But since then, there have been setbacks: seizures, bowel obstructions, four more hospitalizations, and [multiple additional] surgeries with complications.  
Our world has shattered. Every moment is a battle — watching him struggle, fearing what the future holds, clinging to hope while drowning in uncertainty.  
But as if that agony weren’t enough, I’ve also been forced to wage another relentless battle—this one against a cold, indifferent private health insurance industry that treats my son like a number instead of a life worth fighting for.  
We, as members of any health insurance plan, are a good bet for this system as long as we remain healthy. When life deals us a cruel blow, however, like it did to Aidan, it’s as if we are losses to be cut.  
While he fights for every inch of progress, I’m fighting just to get him the care he desperately needs. While Aidan has made strides and continues to make progress, he currently requires two people just to reposition him or change him. He cannot consistently follow directions, leaving medical professionals unsure about his cognitive abilities.  
Yet, despite Aidan’s obvious need for specialized rehabilitation, his ongoing care has been denied by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care innumerable times, and for the third time we have escalated to the appeal level. Neither of the two physicians at HPHC who have been responsible for denying approval for services for Aidan is identified as being certified or specializing in traumatic brain injury. 
Because I am an employee of the Commonwealth, my coverage falls under the purview of the Massachusetts Group Insurance Commission, which adjudicates coverage disputes for state employees, and it has ruled in our favor on two separate occasions.  
As Aidan’s mother, I have fought tirelessly to ensure he receives the treatment he needs to not just survive but to have a chance at recovery. What I’ve encountered is resistance and a fragmented system that has left me terrified for Aidan’s future.

Since the accident on December 20, 2023, Aidan has been shuttled between Lahey Hospital and Medical Center in Burlington, Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Charlestown, RiverRidge Neurorehabilitation Center in Kennebunk, Maine, and, as of May 5, the Neurobehavioral Rehabilitation Program at CareOne in Holyoke.  
Each facility has provided vital treatment, but the moment insurance deems Aidan’s recovery insufficient, they deny his coverage and the pressure begins to discharge him. Without access to robust, ongoing rehabilitation, progress Aidan has fought so hard to make could be lost.  
Standing beside the bed of my critically injured child in December of 2023, I never imagined that once it was clear that Aidan would survive, the most terrifying part of this journey would be the disjointed and ill-defined care available for him.  
It’s hard to describe both the disbelief and fear I experienced hearing medical professionals say to me, on the one hand, “The system is broken” and, on the other hand, “maybe you should focus on the now and not on what’s next for Aidan.” 
Aidan’s current inability to reliably follow directions limits his outpatient therapy options. The state’s only pediatric inpatient rehabilitation hospital has denied him, saying he’s not a good candidate. Neither of the state’s two pediatric skilled nursing facilities have units that treat traumatic brain injury (TBI) or acquired brain injury (ABI).  
Aidan is covered by both my private health insurance and, since his accident, by the state’s Medicaid program, MassHealth. The Commonwealth offers two waiver programs for individuals with brain injuries—the Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) and Moving Forward Plan (MFP) waivers—which provide a wide range of services, including home health aides and various therapies.  
We applied for the MFP waiver, which is more appropriate given Aidan’s age. However, these waiver benefits cannot be used in skilled nursing facilities, even if we were able to bring in outside occupational or physical therapists. 
At the same time, because Aidan is considered a pediatric patient until age 22, adult rehabilitation centers with TBI/ABI programs are legally unable to admit him without a waiver. With advocacy from the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services and MassHealth, the Holyoke Neurobehavioral Rehabilitation Program agreed to take Aidan and applied for that waiver. 
As for homecare, while the MassHealth waivers will help, they would only provide about half of the 24/7 level of support Aidan requires. We can supplement these hours with the Massachusetts Personal Care Assistant program, which provides funds and other resources to hire personal care assistants that allow disabled individuals to stay in their community, but care providers may not show up on certain days with little or no notice. Reliant on my job and its insurance benefits, becoming a full-time caregiver myself is not an option—which is true for most loved ones of brain injury survivors. 
At the root of this crisis is a broken continuum of care for traumatic brain injury and acquired brain injury patients. These injuries require long-term rehabilitation. Research and experience have shown that even those initially deemed unlikely to recover can make significant progress with the right support. But progress takes time—far longer than insurance companies or current care models will allow. 
Without this continuum, survivors like Aidan are often sent home without adequate support or placed in nursing homes that don’t offer the life-changing therapies that are critical to their recovery. Many more are living in the community with insufficient help. 
For Aidan, in his current state, this fragmented system means no future guarantee that he can access therapies he desperately needs. 
State lawmakers have the power to increase access to post-acute rehabilitation in ways that other states have previously done without increasing costs. The supports for brain-injured patients must be shored up to ensure that no one is denied the chance to recover due to systemic shortcomings. This requires: 
Expanding Sub-Acute Rehabilitation: All TBI and ABI patients should have access to facilities equipped to meet their unique needs, regardless of their age or progress rate. Recovery from severe brain injury is a lifelong process, and long-term rehabilitation leads to better outcomes, reducing the overall burden on the health care system. Massachusetts was home to one of the first sub-acute brain injury rehabilitation facilities, and like so many of the hospitals in the state, it was world renowned. It closed in 2001. 
Establishing a Dedicated Care Coordination System: When Aidan was rushed to Lahey after the accident, the hospital administrators acted quickly—helping me secure legal guardianship, initiate MassHealth coverage, and begin the disability application process. But one critical support was missing: a complex care manager.  
This role should be an automatic part of the response to catastrophic injuries. A care manager could guide families from the very start, helping them navigate the maze of eligibility rules, paperwork, and services, and ensuring their loved one receives appropriate therapies and support at every stage of recovery. Although the state recently assigned us a complex care manager, I wasn’t aware of this service until nine months after the accident—and now they have taken us on because an administrator from another state office contacted them directly on our behalf.  
Addressing Gaps in Skilled Nursing Facilities: More facilities must be equipped with the staff and expertise to care for and provide the necessary therapies for TBI and ABI patients. Only a handful of adult skilled facilities in the state have this expertise, while none of the pediatric facilities do. Additionally, here in Massachusetts and across the country, there is an urgent need to address the critical shortage of certified nursing assistants and personal care assistants. 
Managing Aidan’s care often leaves me sleepless and overwhelmed. I spend countless hours worrying and curating information about available resources. Medical professionals are compassionate, but openly acknowledge the system is broken. Accepting this would mean giving up on Aidan and condemning him to a life of lost potential – something I cannot do. 
Nearly two years ago, I sat by my son’s hospital bed, holding his hand and willing him to survive. Today, I fight for him to live a life beyond survival. He deserves that chance. All brain injury survivors do.

Criminal defense lawyers say that’s because the state is intentionally deprioritizing much-needed changes, citing the lack of legislative action, as well as the underfunding of the public defender system, and an appeal filed by the state earlier this year seeking to block the temporary release of indigent defendants until they are provided legal representation.
Of the more than 35 bills related to indigent defense that the Legislature considered this session, only five became law. Gov. Janet Mills signed two of the bills while three more became law without her signature. Four additional bills were enacted by the Legislature but held by Mills to either veto within the first three days of the next session in January or let them become law without her signature. 
The governor vetoed one bill that aimed to clarify when an indigent defendant is entitled to counsel at the state’s expense. The laws that did pass, for the most part, did not enact any sweeping changes to the criminal justice system, three experts told the Maine Morning Star.
Meanwhile, there are still almost 300 people without attorneys as of August 27, almost 45 of whom are currently in jail, according to a Maine Morning Star analysis of court data.
State commission, lawmakers declare ‘all hands on deck’ effort to address indigent defense crisis

“Overall, I would say it was a disappointing session. I understand, in light of the budget constraints everybody was under, that they felt they were limited in what they could do,” said Jim Billings, executive director of the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services.
“But what left an especially sour taste in our mouths after the session concluded was that there was $150 million left over that they had not calculated correctly,” he added, referring to the $152 million surplus that Maine ended with at the close of the fiscal year on June 30, “and despite having a civil rights lawsuit still pending and a court order saying we’re violating the U.S. Constitution, we received very little in the way of new resources.”
Billings announced last month that he would be stepping down from his post in October.
Some defense attorneys argued that Mills is partly the reason for the Legislature’s lack of progress and funding for the public defense system.
“We have a governor who, through her cohorts, has made it very clear that they are not going to support any real, true criminal legal reform. We have a Legislature that has not been able to address this issue, or will not address this issue,” said Tina Nadeau, executive director of the Maine Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. “So anything that could have a wide impact on the people that we serve … has not had any positive reception.”
Mills’ office denied this claim, touting the recent establishment of the state’s first public defender offices and increasing the commission budget from approximately $20 million to $45 million per year. In 2023, Mills also signed into law a raise for private attorneys that the commission contracts with from $80 to $150.
“Despite having significantly more money, the number of rostered attorneys has not increased to required levels, and the system continues to struggle to find lawyers to represent indigent defendants,” Mills’ spokesperson Ben Goodman said.
Insufficient funding persists
However, Maine’s public defender offices are new and the 33 employed public defenders can’t take on all the indigent defendants’ cases, so the bulk of cases are still contracted out to private criminal defense lawyers. There are between 35 and 50 rostered attorneys out of a list of 300 that take on a majority of cases, with others working for the commission part-time. Those lawyers charged about 325,000 total billable hours last year, which Billings said amounted to about $48 million — exceeding the annual budget allocated to the commission.
“They’re not facing the reality that for a time period, we’re going to be paying for two systems, so it’s costing us over $56 million this year for a partial public defender system,” he said. “It’s going to take some patience and some amount of time for the public defenders to start absorbing the billable hours that were all going to the rostered attorneys before we start to see some savings.”
Because of those costs, the commission will have no funds left to keep paying rostered attorneys for the last quarter of the fiscal year, starting April 2026, unless the Legislature approves an additional $13 million before then, Billings said.

Those lawyers, which include Nadeau and Jim Howaniec, a longtime criminal defense lawyer and former mayor of Lewiston, are expecting major disruptions. 
“The rubber is going to hit the road come April 1, when people are still going to get arrested, but the criminal defense lawyers aren’t going to be paid,” Howaniec said.
Lawmakers on the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee were caught between two competing realities this session, said co-chair Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland): “The need for [Public Defense Services] to have additional funding and the lack of a surplus of resources for the Legislature to appropriate.”
Both Nadeau and Howaniec pointed out that the state also has $1.03 billion in the state’s Budget Stabilization Fund, also called the “rainy day fund,” which could be tapped for short-term relief. 
“The state of Maine has been sued for violating the Sixth Amendment. Is it not raining yet?” Nadeau asked.
Asked about the commission’s pending budget shortfall, the governor’s spokesperson said she would evaluate its budget and “work with the Legislature in the next legislative session to consider what needs may be reasonable —- and what the Commission itself can do — to continue to address this issue.”
“In the meantime, the Governor has said publicly that lawyers who represent indigent defendants should be confident they will be fully paid for their work,” Goodman added.
Goodman also cited Maine Superior Court Justice Michaela Murphy’s March 2025 order that said the public defender offices are not taking on enough cases despite being staffed. He also pointed to the governor’s suggestion that the commission remove limits on the number of cases that private contracted lawyers could take on.










We are building a long term solution and there is no quick fix to this.


– Jim Billings, executive director of the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services


However, Billings said in March there were only five public defenders responsible for training and taking on cases, and 1,000 defendants waiting for counsel. At that time, the offices were not fully operational with many positions still vacant, and there were many entry level and out-of-state attorneys with no Maine experience. 
“The state of Maine has simply not dedicated the necessary resources to solve this problem, and it cannot be fixed on the backs of five people,” he said. “We are building a long term solution and there is no quick fix to this.”
Legislative progress
One of the bills that became law without the governor’s signature this session, LD 1101 sponsored by Carney, funded eight new positions within the commission, five assistant defenders and three support staff. Carney said she hopes the law can support public defenders to take on cases that might be hard to find contracted defense lawyers for.
Michael Kebede, policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said it was “very good” that the Legislature was able to fund this bill “in a legislative session where funding was very scarce.” 
“These positions are primarily responsible for providing indigent legal services to criminal defendants and parties in child protective proceedings, and that’s essentially the source of the crisis,” Kebede said. “There aren’t enough such people, and so this bill just creates more of the jobs that we need to solve the indigent defense crisis.”
Billings, however, said while the law created the new positions, they were not ones that the commission had requested. He also criticized the provision allowing the judicial branch to appoint attorneys not vetted or supervised by the commission, which he said was a step backward.
Broader reforms lacking
Even with adequate funding, the lack of broader reforms to the criminal justice system, which would decrease the number of people requiring legal defense, remains an issue. Hundreds of defendants who can’t afford attorneys are still facing the consequences of a harsh criminal code, Nadeau and Howaniec said.
“The problems that I see in the court system are racial, they’re economic, they’re political, but the bottom line is, the amount of focus on ‘getting tough on crime’ is disproportionate to making sure that people have an adequate criminal defense system,” Howaniec said. 










The problems that I see in the court system are racial, they're economic, they're political, but the bottom line is, the amount of focus on ‘getting tough on crime’ is disproportionate to making sure that people have an adequate criminal defense system.


– Jim Howaniec, criminal defense attorney


Carney said lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee shared this concern. “We are prosecuting things as crimes that shouldn’t be crimes under Maine’s criminal code, and by doing so, we’re unduly burdening both the judicial system and also the defense services,” she said.
But most of the reforms that would change the criminal code were either rejected by the committee, or were carried over to the next session. 
Lawmaker hopes to alleviate attorney backlog by changing how Maine punishes bail violations

Some of those include bills ensuring access to speedy trials for defendants, allowing people to be released on parole, decriminalizing small amounts of drug possession, limiting how many years younger people can be sentenced, diversifying the jury pool and getting rid of charges filed against someone out on bail who violates their conditions of release — Maine’s most common criminal charge.
That bill, LD 179 introduced by Rep. David Sinclair, an attorney from Bath, would have removed the crime of violating conditions of release. Maine is one of only six states with such a charge that serves as a separate class E crime, punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
In 2024 alone, there were over 5,400 such charges filed in Maine courts, Frayla Tarpinian, a former prosecutor who oversees Maine’s first public defender office, said in a statement to the committee. In comparison, she said the second most common type of charge was 662 cases of drug possession.
Sinclair told Maine Morning Star in February that he believed removing the separate charge for violating conditions or release would help alleviate the state’s indigent defense system. 
However, that bill was ultimately opposed by the committee. Carney said while some agreed with the principles underlying the proposal, arguments that such a charge is an important tool for protecting survivors of domestic violence ultimately swayed their vote.
A related bill, which was one of the only ones signed into law this year, allows prosecutors to determine whether to reduce certain class E crimes to civil violations.
Maine is far from alone in struggling to pass broader reforms, said Abbe Smith, a law professor and director of the Criminal Defense and Prisoner Advocacy Clinic at Georgetown University. 
“Everybody wants to be known as tough on crime, concerned about public safety, and I think opposition to commonsense reforms often plays on that fear of crime,” said Smith.
She added, “criminal defendants have no constituency. Nobody really cares about the quality of representation, except some lawyers and those who find themselves in the system.”
Indigent defense crisis in courts


Over the past few years, Maine’s indigent defense crisis has not substantially improved, with hundreds of people sitting in jail without attorneys over the years, Nadeau and Howaniec said. 
This January, the Kennebec County Superior Court ruled the state’s failure to provide timely counsel to defendants who can’t afford an attorney a constitutional crisis, and in March said the state must create a plan to address it.
Murphy, the judge, also agreed to consider releasing indigent defendants who have been jailed without legal counsel for at least 14 days, and to temporarily dismiss charges against defendants without representation for more than 60 days after their initial court appearance.
But the state appealed that decision and hearings on individual cases that could have started in June were paused until October when the case will go before the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. As a result, no defendants were released or had their charges temporarily dismissed, according to the ACLU. 
“It’s such a problem that the brakes have been completely pumped on the most fundamental remedy for this ongoing crisis of people not having representation,” Nadeau said. “The real violation, from the state’s perspective, is these folks would be getting away with something, and how dare they. Because the state doesn’t think the people who are without counsel deserve a remedy.”
Next steps
Several other reforms will be considered when the Legislature reconvenes in January.
These include LD 1941, which would reestablish parole, and LD 449, which proposes conditional discharge for certain defendants. 
Carney said she doesn’t know whether it is possible to make the changes proposed in LD 449 to the state criminal code, although it is “trying to get at that same concern that we’re spending more resources charging and prosecuting people than we need to spend in order to achieve the rehabilitative purpose of the criminal code.”
Another carried over bill that Carney said could improve judicial efficiency is LD 340, which would establish different time limits for criminal trials. However, both Nadeau and the Maine Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers oppose the legislation because they say it is not adequate.
Another bill that could get taken up again next session is LD 338, which would expand jury pool diversity. That legislation was passed by both chambers but is being held by the governor. 
Howaniec said the lack of diversity in juries increases the inequity of Maine’s judicial system.
“There’s obviously a disproportionately larger number of minorities charged with crimes because there’s a correlation between poverty and crime,” Howaniec said. 
Carney agreed that the underlying policy is important and said it may be worth looking into how current jury pools are determined.

(Photo by Michael B. Thomas/Getty Images)As Planned Parenthoods in the state and across the country navigate federal budget cuts, workers at an Ohio affiliate are fighting for the future of the organization.
Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio announced on Aug. 4 that staffing reductions were on the horizon, as a result of the cuts to Medicaid in the federal budget bill, and specific cuts that directly impact Planned Parenthood.
The greater Ohio affiliate announced the finalized reduction on Friday, with a total of 20 staff members losing their jobs. Of those 20, 17 were union members under Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio Workers United, the newly formed union under the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) Local 98. Three other employees unaffiliated with the union also lost their jobs.
A press release announcing the staffing reductions said the cuts amount to more than $1.1 million in savings. Staffers were notified of layoffs throughout last week.
“We did everything we could to avoid layoffs,” said Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio president and CEO Erica Wilson-Domer, in a statement with the announcement.
PPGOH Workers United is in their first ever negotiations for a bargaining agreement, having been voluntarily recognized by Planned Parenthood as a union at the beginning of 2025.
Since the announcement of funding cuts, the union created a letter-writing campaign for members. The call for letters acknowledged that budget cuts from the federal side “have been devastating” and that “hard decisions have to be made in light of these cuts,” but asked leaders to commit to a 25% reduction in salary.
“We don’t believe in advocating for salary cuts when it is unnecessary,” the union stated. “However, it has been made expressly clear in our negotiations that cutting a critical number of care-providing staff is management’s only solution to its budget crisis, and we don’t believe in cutting front-facing roles before all other options have been exhausted.”
The call for letters also stated that Planned Parenthood management in the greater Ohio affiliate had confirmed in mid-August that no plans were made to cut pay for the senior leadership team.
“We’ve lost some really important players,” Clarie Randall, an organizer at the OPEIU Local 98, told the Capital Journal.
Those that survived the layoffs continue to believe that their jobs and the clinics they work for are important to the communities they serve, and they plan to fight to keep them open.
“This is my community, I live in this community, I’ve raised my child in this community,” said Sarah Fernandez, who has been a health care assistant in Mansfield for three years. “I’m not planning on leaving, so I really need my community to be a safe and flourishing place.”
Wilson-Domer said overall cuts brought by the Trump administration amount to an annual loss of $10 million for the affiliate. Without a staffing reduction, the greater Ohio branch would “cease to exist, leaving over 50,000 patients without access to birth control, gender affirming care, abortion and a myriad of other essential services,” according to the affiliate leader.
A lawsuit has been filed by the national Planned Parenthood Federation of America to push back against Medicaid cuts, and the judge presiding over the case said Medicaid reimbursement should continue as the lawsuit goes forward.
The potential loss of Medicaid funds and the uncertainty in support for the work she does is “terrifying” for Fernandez, and adding tension in union negotiations and questions about transparency between affiliate leaders and workers has been disappointing.
“It’s terrifying to think that I might not be able to do what I do forever,” Fernandez said. “It feels like it’s much less about patient care and more like ‘we need to stay afloat.’”
Randall said bargaining agreement negotiations had been “amicable” until August, when staff were notified of the layoffs.
“It’s just been really disheartening, and I think morale is down,” Randall said. “It’s going to be harder (to provide care) because with fewer people there’s more jobs to cover, and workers are going to be spread thin.”
Wilson-Domer said the affiliate “has been engaged in nearly a month of good faith” negotiations with the union “regarding the necessary reduction in force and in consideration of various proposals.”
“This is a process that takes time,” Wilson-Domer said in a statement to the Capital Journal. “We understand that this is a stressful process for staff.”
She said the union has been informed that “overall director level and above compensation” has been cut by about $2 million.
“The impacts of a total $10 million funding loss unfortunately cannot be solved entirely through cutting executive compensation,” Wilson-Domer said.
The most recent tax filing for the non-profit (called a 990) is from 2023, in which Iris Harvey was still president and CEO, at an annual salary of $318,703. Wilson-Domer was chief strategy and transformation officer at the time, making $206,616 annually. Chief Medical Officer Adarsh Krishen was reported as making $177,022 per year and Chief External Affairs Officer Abigail Smardon was listed at an annual salary of $167,578.
Wilson-Domer reiterated that even with the staffing cuts, the organization “will continue to offer all of the services it currently does at our health centers.”
“This reduction does not include any health center closures,” she told the Capital Journal. “As long as our doors are open, PPGOH remains committed to providing high-quality, affordable and timely health care to all our patients.”
In Mansfield, Fernandez said as they await decisions about Medicaid funding and the true impact of local layoffs, struggles have to be expected, even as workers strive to keep providing the consistent service for those seeking birth control, STI screenings and gender affirming care, among other things.
“I think it’s really going to have to be a push of community members coming together and saying we need this clinic to stay open,” Fernandez said.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Ohio’s new House minority leader, Dani Isaacsohn, says teaming up with the Republicans is essential to getting Democratic priorities accomplished.
Democrats are hopeful that new leadership can score them some wins as they prepare to head back to the Statehouse soon.
“Our focus as a caucus every single day is going to be ‘How do we serve the people of Ohio by making their lives better, making it more affordable, easier to access opportunity, more stability, more safety in their communities and their neighborhoods?'” Isaacsohn said.
The 36-year-old Cincinnati lawyer is the new face of the House Democrats, being voted to replace former Minority Leader Allison Russo, who stepped down in June to prepare for her secretary of state campaign.
Along with Isaacsohn, state Rep. Phil Robinson (D-Solon) is the assistant leader, state Rep. Beryl Brown Piccolantonio (D-Gahanna) is the whip, and state Rep. Desiree Tims (D-Dayton) is the assistant whip.
Isaacsohn has risen to the top of the party since joining the legislature in 2023. He had been the whip since 2024 and was the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.
Isaacsohn is known for bipartisanship, a strength he says will help Democrats stay relevant in the GOP-controlled supermajority.
“Nothing gets done without working together across the aisle,” the leader said.
While in the legislature, his focus has been on affordable housing. He helped make changes that provided relief to homeowners, earning him praise from leaders across the aisle.
“Dani Isaacsohn… very passionate about bridging the gap on Ohio’s housing challenges,” state Sen. Michele Reynolds (R-Canal Winchester) said.
Former lawmaker and current chair of the state’s property tax reform working group, Bill Seitz, emphasized the Democrat’s ability to find answers on property tax rates.
“There is a solution which Senator Blessing, Representative Isaacson have come up with,” Seitz said, adding that their proposal of a circuit breaker is the “best solution.”
Despite Isaacsohn’s positive relationship with the GOP, he will face challenges. Republicans do not need any Democratic votes in order to pass legislation.
“We would like to have 99 votes and that’s, that’s just typically is not possible,” House Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) said regarding the state’s operating budget.
The most impactful vote each General Assembly makes is the state’s massive two-year budget, one that, this year, didn’t get a single Democratic vote. Isaacsohn said he will work to help get the minority party into the decision-making room.
“We’re really focused on delivering results for the people we serve, and to do that, we have to work across the aisle,” Isaacsohn said.
The leader stayed in touch with Huffman over the summer break, he said, talking about topics like redistricting and the legislative calendar. The lawmakers are set to come back the week of September.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Kansas House Democrats made a recent stop in Hays on their statewide “fight back” tour. The event drew an impressive crowd of more than 100 people who overflowed into the various alcoves and hallways of the Glassman Bird Law Firm to listen to our representatives.
The mission for the evening, according to the webpage dedicated to the “fight back” tour, was as follows: “This tour isn’t just about conversation, it’s about mobilization. Together, we will strategize, organize, and take action to protect our democracy and advance a vision rooted in equity, opportunity, and justice for all Kansans.”
I was encouraged by the turnout, but I felt that the representatives who were present were unprepared to address the “protect our democracy” component of their mission statement.
The event began with questions about schools, property tax and appraisal processes but invariably turned toward national politics when a young woman voiced concerns about the deployment of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., and her fear of martial law being declared nationwide.
Rep. Stephanie Sawyer Clayton, D-Overland Park, reassured the questioner that martial law was unlikely to be declared in a red state like Kansas.
“I’m not pleased with what’s going on at the federal level, but I do not think that we will see martial law in Kansas. Lord have mercy, I hope I’m right on that, but instinctually I don’t think we will,” Clayton said.
I was annoyed. Our democratic representatives had been travelling around the state on a self-titled “fight back” tour for which they had printed banners and posters and even made a webpage. But when asked about the threat of right-wing authoritarianism in our country their response was simply to hope that it doesn’t happen in Kansas? Is crossing your fingers really the best way to “protect democracy”?
I raised my hand to tell Sawyer Clayton that her response to the question was not at all comforting. In turn she asked me what I thought she should do about martial law while adding that she was “open to suggestions.”
A good faith interpretation of her response would see it as fulfilling one of the objectives of the “fight back” tour — to organize and strategize as a community. But it felt to me like a teacher arriving to class and asking the students, “So, what would you like to do today?”
If House Democrats are truly interested in organizing toward the lofty goal of protecting democracy, they must come to these types of meetings with more than an openness to suggestions. They must have a plan!
My frustration only deepened at the end of the evening. Just as I was leaving, Rep. Mike Amyx, D-Lawrence, shook my hand and thanked me for coming and offering my input. I told him how surprised I was that they had not been corresponding or strategizing with Democrats in other states about how to counter the increasingly authoritarian maneuvers of the right.
He gave me a platitude about my generation being “agents of change” and encouraged me to make my voice heard through calls and emails. I don’t recall exactly what I said in response, but it was something along the lines of, “I’m literally in front of you right now.”
It is frustrating that Democrats in Kansas and across the United States continue to warn of “democracy in peril” in their tweets, speeches, and event promotions, while still delivering canned statements and maintaining a business-as-usual politics that fails to match the gravity of their rhetoric and of our political situation.
Kansas Democrats recently sent a letter to Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall asking for congressional oversight on the Department of Homeland Security. But only 17 of 37 Kansas House Democrats and five of the nine Kansas Senate Democrats signed the letter. This falls far short of the unity that is required to meet the challenges ahead. Sending the letter is a good start, but it’s the kind of thing that Kansas Democrats should be doing weekly if not daily.
Kansas Democrats need to begin thinking seriously about worst case scenarios. What would they do if the National Guard were deployed in Kansas? Would they file a lawsuit? Break quorum? Protest — and how? What if Trump were to blackmail Kansas universities as he has done to Harvard and Columbia? What if one of their constituents were arrested for writing an op-ed that criticizes Israel?
These are not abstract hypotheticals. Trump has recently ordered the mobilization of more National Guard troops from 19 states and is signaling his intention to send troops into Chicago in the same manner that he has done in D.C.
The representatives on the “fight back” tour are decent, intelligent people who truly have Kansans’ best interests at heart. That was clear to me. My point in writing this is not to disparage their character but to point out that they have a serious blind spot when it comes to being prepared for authoritarianism.
They, along with Democrats across the country, might be caught in what the political philosopher David Runciman calls the “confidence trap.” Each time a democracy overcomes a crisis it gains confidence that it will do the same in the future. Eventually, a crisis may arrive where citizens and politicians will fail to do the things that got them through the crises of the past because they believe implicitly that they will pull through.
Our democracy may have weathered the storm of Trump 1.0, but its second iteration is already far more extreme and unrestrained. If we want to make it through, Kansas Democrats need to stop being complacent and get activated. This means developing contingency plans, speaking to lawyers and working to develop a united front among all Kansas Democrats.
On a personal level, they should be reading literature from our Founding Fathers or resistance fighters like Nelson Mandela who put their lives on the line for freedom and democracy. Because in addition to collective action, they should be asking themselves how far they are personally prepared to go if our democracy is what’s at stake.

Now he’s ordering soldiers into our streets for the fourth time as president to viciously target some of the most vulnerable members of our society — despite abundant evidence that prosecuting homelessness only makes it worse.
The cost of this cruel power grab is borne by taxpayers like you and me.
Previous reporting found that National Guard deployments cost the U.S. government $530 per Guard member, per day. So the price tag of deploying 2,091 troops to D.C. is well over $1 million per day — and the number of troops will likely continue to grow. And with no deadline for the D.C. deployment, those costs could add up for months or even years.
This militarized spending comes at the expense of federal programs — like public housing — that actually do prevent crime and improve health and education outcomes.
Using those figures and other publicly available data, I calculated that the daily cost of operating public housing for all 5,616 people who are unhoused in D.C. on any given night is one-quarter the daily expense of deploying the National Guard. If the Guard remains deployed for three months, it would cost more than operating public housing for the entire unhoused population in D.C. for an entire year. 
That’s also true in the states whose GOP governors are voluntarily sending National Guard troops to the capital. Across those six states — Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Ohio, South Carolina, West Virginia — some 30,000 people are unhoused. The daily cost of operating safe shelter for all 30,000 would be less than one day of the D.C. occupation.
In fact, it’s true in almost every state, I learned.
The daily expense of deploying troops to D.C. is more than four times the daily cost of operating public housing for Georgia’s unhoused population, five times for Nevada’s unhoused population, and 15 times for all unhoused people in Wisconsin.
If you want numbers for your own city, county, state, or congressional district, you can use the National Priorities Project’s trade off calculator at NationalPriorities.org to learn more about what taxpayers in your area are paying towards militarism — and the services we could be enjoying instead.
Trump’s decision to hyper-militarize our streets is transpiring on the heels of the MAGA budget bill, which cuts food and medical services for millions across the country to further enrich billionaires and war profiteers.
Deploying troops in our nation’s capital, rather than investing in what makes communities safe and prosperous, is yet another attempt to scapegoat struggling people — especially communities of color — to advance a draconian agenda in service of billionaires, war profiteers, and white supremacy.
Government spending on straightforward solutions that help poor and working-class people faces constant political backlash. But providing affordable housing to end homelessness in D.C. would be far cheaper than deploying troops — and would do far more to improve the city’s security.

Federal immigration officials in Washington state arrived on the scene of the largest wildfire in the state last Wednesday and arrested two firefighters who had been working to contain the blaze.
Wildfire veterans say it’s nearly unprecedented for federal agents to conduct immigration enforcement near the front lines of an active wildfire. Some fear the raid could reverberate throughout the wildland fire community, making it more difficult to fully staff the crews putting out blazes at the peak of fire season in the West.
“There’s a lot of brown bodies out there on the fire line,” said Bobbie Scopa, who had a 45-year career as a firefighter and now serves as executive secretary with Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of wildfire professionals.
Scopa noted that President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has swept up even some workers who are in the country legally.
“When the rumble from this goes around, we’re going to have contractors unable to put out as many crews as they were,” she said. “We don’t know what the requirement is not to get shipped off by ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. Even if you’re a citizen and you look the wrong way, you could still get picked up.”
Trump’s cuts to federal wildfire crews could have ‘scary’ consequences

On Wednesday morning, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents pulled aside two crews of firefighters that had been working for companies contracted to help fight the Washington fire. The Bear Gulch Fire, spreading through rugged terrain in and around Olympic National Park, has burned nearly 9,000 acres.
“They were told they were going to cut firewood,” said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, a nonprofit industry group. “The people that were supposed to meet them never showed up, and eventually immigration showed up instead.”
Many contract crews rely heavily on immigrant labor.
“[Immigrants] make up a huge portion of forestry and fire, they’re an integral part of this industry,” Polhamus said.
Now, wildland fire veterans fear that the immigrants who have been protecting communities from fires could make fire camps a target for immigration officials who are trying to meet deportation quotas. And more high-profile raids on fire crews could cause many in the workforce to reconsider their profession.
“If you’re a migrant worker and this starts happening, are you going to keep on doing that and risk getting picked up?” Scopa said. “If [immigration authorities] keep visiting fire camps, we will definitely have fewer contract crews.”
In a news release, U.S. Border Patrol said the operation was the result of an investigation by the federal Bureau of Land Management. Federal agents, the release said, found discrepancies on the rosters provided by contract fire companies. Immigration officers arrested two people who were in the country illegally, the release said, while removing 42 additional firefighters from the fire scene. The release said the government has terminated its contracts with the companies.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., a member of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, was one of the companies whose workers were checked, Polhamus said. The company was able to show that its firefighters all had legal H-2B visas, he said, which allow foreign nationals to fill temporary, nonagricultural jobs. Still, the company’s crew was demobilized and sent home, which he said was allegedly due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet. The company has not yet gotten official word from the feds about its contract, Polhamus said.
Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

Neither Table Rock Forestry nor the other company targeted by the raid responded to requests for comment.
The Border Patrol statement said the operation did not interfere with firefighting operations. Tom Stokesberry, public information officer with California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, which oversaw the fire crews until Thursday, said the team was aware of the Border Patrol raid. Incident management teams deploy across the country to help coordinate the response to large fires. He would not comment on whether the raid affected wildfire operations.
Polhamus, along with many others in the wildland firefighter community, said it is widely believed that the same incident management team called immigration authorities to investigate another Hispanic crew last year. The raid this week took place on the California team’s last day in charge of the fire, hours before a Washington team took command.
While most fire crews with government agencies hire only U.S. citizens, officials also contract with private companies to help fight many wildfires. Those companies often hire workers on H-2B visas or immigrants who are working to earn their U.S. citizenship.
The effects of workers being detained could go well beyond those individuals, experts said. If a crew loses two or three members, it may no longer meet the specifications it needs to fulfill its contract. That could result in the entire crew being grounded — without pay — until replacements arrive.
“We utilize thousands and thousands of contract firefighters,” Scopa said. “It absolutely could impact our ability to manage fires if we’re losing crews.”
While firefighting contracting companies have varying opinions on the hiring of workers without legal status, Polhamus said, there’s consensus throughout the industry that conducting an immigration raid at the scene of an active wildfire was dangerous and irresponsible.
Washington Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove, who heads the state’s lead wildfire response agency, issued a statement that the state is still gathering details on the Border Patrol operation.
“[T]he Trump administration’s crude and inhumane approach to immigration enforcement has intentionally and unnecessarily stoked fear and mistrust among members of the public —including firefighters putting their lives on the line to protect our State,” he said in the statement.

Both the nonprofit and the concepts of released time religious instruction have expanded in recent years. (Photo courtesy of LifeWise Academy.)In the past month or so, federal courts have dealt a string of blows to conservatives’ push for the biblical Ten Commandments to be posted in public schools.
Yet as states lose over required religious displays, many are working on another route to faith-based education by allowing kids to attend off-campus religious instruction. This year, Iowa, Montana, Ohio and Texas passed laws guaranteeing parents the right to have their children excused during the school day for free, off-campus religious instruction, often called “released time.”
Those four states are the latest of at least 12 that require school districts to offer released time religious schooling upon parental request, including: Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wisconsin.
The released time approach may be more likely to pass constitutional muster than other government-imposed religious efforts, experts say, by shifting influence off school grounds and under the direction of faith-based groups rather than public school teachers, and by making it free to students.
A 1952 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Zorach v. Clauson allows for released time religious instruction as long as it’s off school property, privately funded and parent permitted.
Eyeing a friendly Supreme Court, Republicans push for the Ten Commandments in schools

“Not every family has access to private or parochial school, but for many generations families have been able to take their students out of school for a portion of the day for religious education if they choose,” said Jennifer Jury, a program advocate for LifeWise Academy, an Ohio-based Christian nonprofit founded in 2018.
The organization has been active in expanding its reach and lobbying lawmakers for stronger legislative support. This school year, LifeWise expects to serve nearly 100,000 public school students across 1,100 schools in 34 states, Jury said.
The off-campus gatherings work the same way in most states: With parents’ approval, public school students sign out of school during a lunch, recess or study hall block. Students will either walk or ride one of the distinctive red LifeWise buses to a local church or a program-leased community building in town.
And depending on state limitations for the religious instruction, for either a half or full hour, kids will learn about the Bible. When the allotted time is up, students go back to their public school to finish the day.
In some states, students can earn academic credit for the off-campus instruction, which has been more controversial.
In Montana, for example, legislation that would have required school districts to develop policies for academic credit was amended to “authorize” a district to allow credit, after pushback from the state’s school boards and school administrators associations.
“School districts should have the autonomy to determine which external coursework aligns with the academic frameworks and whether such courses should be eligible for credit,” Rob Watson, who represented the two groups at the legislature, said in his comments to a House committee in February. He noted the groups did not oppose the released time policy itself.
Despite the changes, only one Democrat in the legislature voted “yes.” Montana GOP Gov. Greg Gianforte signed the bill into law in May.
Supporters had touted the academic credit option as a way to entice homeschooling families to consider public schools. In her interview with Stateline, Jury noted similar programs that accommodate Jewish, Muslim and Mormon faith-based teaching for public school students.
“Whether a person is religious or not, the Bible is widely recognized as one of the most influential books in history,” Jury said. “A lot of our Western culture was born out of ideas that come from the Bible, like the fact that every person is created equal, that we are to love our neighbor.”
 Identical bill language

The conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, known as ALEC, in August adopted model legislation about released time policies that state lawmakers can propose.
Public schools would be required to allow dismissal for religious instruction under new bill

ALEC’s proposal would allow from one to five hours per week of off-campus religious instruction and would require school districts to award academic credit if the course meets certain criteria. Districts would have to assess instruction based on secular standards and would not be allowed to test for particular religious content, according to the model legislation.
Nearly identical language had already appeared in several state bills, including in North Carolina and West Virginia this year and in Mississippi in 2023. In North Carolina, LifeWise Academy registered with the secretary of state’s office in 2024, as reported by NC Newsline, and a released time bill was introduced in February. It was sent to committee but never moved ahead.
The bills in Mississippi and West Virginia also stalled.
Legislation that does become law earns praise from groups such as Alliance Defending Freedom, one of the nation’s most active legal organizations opposing abortion rights and same-sex marriage.
Statements from Greg Chafuen, senior counsel for the nonprofit’s Center for Public Policy, say the new released time laws respect “parents’ educational decisions” and ensure “parents are in the driver’s seat when it comes to their kids’ education.”
An Indiana law lets high school students leave school for religious instruction each week for an amount of time equal to one elective course. Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee laws allow students to earn elective credit for released time religious instruction, though it cannot replace a “core curriculum” class. School boards can set standards for when such programs qualify for credit.
LifeWise operates in each of those states.
 Ten Commandment displays

Jury, of LifeWise Academy, said her organization wants off-campus religious options for public school students to be available in all 50 states.
“It’s important to note this is an option, and parents are the ultimate decision-makers in enrollment,” she said.
“We would love to see every student in the United States have the option to attend a program like LifeWise if they want to and if their parents want them to.”
A lack of parental choice might be what trips up state efforts to post the Ten Commandments in classrooms.










This is an option, and parents are the ultimate decision-makers in enrollment.


– Jennifer Jury, a program advocate for LifeWise Academy


After Louisiana last year became the first state in recent decades to require that the Ten Commandments, a central tenet of the Judeo-Christian tradition, be displayed in school classrooms, bills followed in at least 15 other states. Two states — Arkansas and Texas — enacted laws.
But for now, courts have blocked the mandates in all three states. In Texas, U.S. District Judge Fred Biery warned the displays “are likely to pressure [children] into religious observance” and undermine parents’ rights.
In Arkansas, U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks called the state’s requirement to post a specific version of the Ten Commandments “plainly unconstitutional.”
The law “is not neutral with respect to religion,” he wrote. “By design, and on its face, the statute mandates the display of expressly religious scripture in every public-school classroom and library.”
He also noted that the law “requires that a specific version of that scripture be used, one that the uncontroverted evidence in this case shows is associated with Protestantism and is exclusionary of other faiths.”

Created to describe the Nazi’s systematic extermination of 6,000,000 Jews, “genocide” has a high evidentiary threshold in law. It’s not merely a descriptor for war or humanitarian crises but presupposes an extreme level of barbarity. 
Given these facts, it is disturbing to read opinion pieces in various publications, including the July 15 Mirror op-ed ‘In search of moral clarity (again)’,” that promote unsubstantiated Hamas claims, use ‘‘Palestinian genocide’ as accepted fact, and rely on alarmism, for example, by drawing a parallel between Israel’s 20-month defensive war and the Rwandan genocide, a minimally reported horror that saw 800,000 tortured, raped, and killed within four months.
The Gaza Health Ministry is part of the vast and successful propaganda machine that is integral to Hamas’ power. We should carefully evaluate pro-Hamas claims and make every effort to avoid oversized rhetoric like invoking the Rwandan genocide. 
The mainstream media, having published some inexcusably flawed articles, also bear responsibility here. For example, a precipitous and reckless BBC news articles accused Israel of a late-2023 rocket attack on Gaza’s Al-Ahli Hospital. In fact, both U.S. and French intelligence identified a Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket failure for the destruction and casualties. When outlets get it wrong, as they often do  when  competing for “clicks,” especially when relying on sources within Gaza, they do not correct or retract but merely “update” the existing article. The “updates” do not receive attention. Instead, the media often pass the corrections off as a “changing landscape” issue rather than a deficient reporting and sourcing issue.
We see the same incomplete reporting on Hamas’ Gaza Health Ministry death figures. The Associated Press has finally, but not sufficiently, massaged its boilerplate language to try more fully to explain the data.
The Henry Jackson Society published a report identifying multiple anomalies and caveats in the Gaza death data. At the time of the report, Palestinians and AP claimed 40,000 deaths from military operations in civilian areas. They did not identify which dead were terrorists, and they purposefully concealed that Hamas is using schools, hospitals and even U.N. buildings for military command and operations. Hamas has turned civilian infrastructure into legal military targets. In fact, the Jackson Society researchers could attribute more than half of the 40,000 to battlefield deaths, friendly fire incidents involving Islamic extremist munitions (like Al-Ahli Hospital), and deaths unrelated to the war.
It bears repeating that Israel has made unprecedented efforts to avoid killing civilians and been consistent in its war aims to recover the hostages and end Hamas control in Gaza. On the other hand, Hamas and its Palestinian supporters publicly proclaimed their intent to kill civilians and eradicate Jews from Israel, planned the October 7 attack on Israeli civilians for 17 years; and are still holding Israeli hostages. By definition alone, the genocidal entity is Hamas.
I was dismayed that the author of the op-ed suggested we should relitigate the 108- year-old Balfour Declaration as though Israel was some sort of gift to the indigenous Jewish people. The Balfour Declaration was a long-fought for starting point to return Jews to their ancestral homeland. For 3,000 years Jews have lived in what’s now Israel. To suggest it started with Lord Balfour is an argument that fundamentally denies Jewish self-determination. After all, the Balfour Declaration is rooted in World War I and the fall of the Ottoman empire. Borders changed, territory was apportioned to the Arabs, Jews, and many other groups. Yet, I’ve never heard the charge of colonialism levied at anyone except the Jews. Funny about that.
Finally, while I’d like to believe in the best of humanity, according to the latest Palestine Center poll, the “overwhelming majority” of Palestinians don’t want Hamas to disarm. Despite Hamas’ own video evidence, 90% don’t believe Hamas men raped, brutalized, and killed civilians on October 7; most believe the anti-Hamas uprisings in Gaza are contrived; and half don’t support the protests against Hamas’ brutality. 
Over the past 100+ years, the Palestinians have insisted on maintaining perpetual refugee status, working toward elimination of Israel, instead of permanently settling in their own sovereign state. The world has logged tens of thousands of diplomatic hours and billions of dollars working towards a two-state solution, which the Palestinians have consistently rejected. 
In return, Palestinians and their leaders have given the world only violence, terrorism, and 75+ years of intransigence. It’s something to think about when people tell you they “stand in solidarity with Palestinians.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-03 04:01:55+00:00,CT Mirror,Bike recycling program no match for regressive pro-car CT,Shelley Buchbinder,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/03/willimantic-bike-recycling-program-no-match-for-regressive-pro-car-ct/,"Real change to challenge regressive car-centric urban landscapes requires public transit that is accessible, reliable, and affordable.","I co-founded the Willimantic-based Bikes for Windham bike recycling program in 2023. The program started small by collecting, checking, and distributing bikes to low-income adults and youth through the basic needs nonprofit WAIM. 
I was excited to be awarded a CT Department of Transportation (CT DOT) Active Transportation microgrant in 2024. With the $ 5,000 grant, we could distribute locks and helmets and purchase a set of repair tools that we’d been borrowing from volunteers. This felt like a win after news that several bikes had been stolen. These bikes are a form of transportation for many people, especially those unhoused or marginally housed, even in the dead of winter. The recycling program’s impact was visible in the increased bikes around Willimantic.
Like many small New England cities and towns with pre-car footprints, Willimantic has a dense, walkable core. I live in the Victorian Hill Section, which is rated “Very Walkable.” Willimantic is the most walkable part of Windham County. While the Willimantic Hill Section is “Very Walkable”, it’s rated as “Somewhat Bikeable.” 
There are no protected bike lanes and no lights on the Airline rail trail, which runs through the center of Willimantic and connects two public housing developments to downtown. Even without infrastructure, biking requires resources like maintenance. Willimantic’s only bike shop, Pedal Power, closed in 2024. Biking requires physical ability, preference, and tolerance to winter ice and summer heat.  Biking without bike lanes, lights, or other support isn’t for most people. And many opportunities exist outside of a reasonable bike commuting distance.  Willimantic is dominated by cars and their associated infrastructure, ranging from parking lots to garages.
Public resources allocated to car investment far exceed those allocated to alternative transit programs, such as the CT DOT microgrants. While there are no protected bike lanes in Willimantic, a parking garage opened in 2022 with 290 parking spots at a reported cost of $12.5 million, with $6 million reimbursed from the state. The garage has eight free electric vehicle (EV) chargers, which disproportionately support wealthier residents.  
A 2024 Gallup poll found that households with incomes over $100,000 are three times more likely to own an EV than households with incomes between $40,000 and $99,000 and seven times more likely than households with incomes under $40,000. These public subsidies are not equitable. As a community college professor with an EV, my parking and charging can be free, while people bike without lanes, and people stand waiting for buses without benches or shelters. This is a regressive pro-car system.
Beyond EVs, wealthier people are more likely to own cars in the U.S., except for public transit-dense cities like New York City and Boston. Public investment in cars, parking, and road subsidies is regressive, benefiting wealthier individuals. 
Due to the lack of other affordable and accessible alternatives, cars are highly desirable for lower-income people. People with cars are more likely to find and keep a job, and are also more likely to have access to food and healthcare. However, cars can be traps for low-income people. The total cost of owning a car can exceed $ 1,000 per month, which includes the costs of the vehicle, insurance, taxes, gas or electricity, maintenance, and repairs. According to a 2025 Bankrate report, the majority of Americans struggle to pay $1,000 in unexpected expenses, such as a car repair, and can be destabilized or take on debt. 
Car costs can be so disruptive to family well-being, and social service agencies are taking notice. A Minneapolis Social Worker became a mechanic and started Lift Garage, providing low-cost repairs. WAIM offers emergency assistance for car expenses that dwarf the bike program.  Beyond repair costs, car costs can be predatory. Racialized minorities, on average, pay more for cars through higher rates for car insurance, car loan denials/predatory loans, and police tickets to drivers.
While getting, insuring, and maintaining cars are a challenge for lower-income people, life without a car on the eastern side of the state can be dangerous.  A lack of access to reliable and affordable transportation can be a barrier to healthcare access.
Generation’s Federally Qualified Health Center primarily serves uninsured and underinsured patients in Eastern Connecticut, with a center located in Willimantic. A study by Generations found that 35% of their patients missed at least one health appointment due to transportation issues; and 67% of their patients reported lacking reliable transportation due to not owning or being unable to use a car.  Without access to a car, public transportation options are limited.  Under 4% of Connecticut commuters use public transportation to get to work. In smaller cities, options are more limited. Willimantic’s Windham Regional Transportation District (WRTD) has no direct connection to CT’s FastTrack regional bus service or CT Rail and Metro North train service.
While I appreciate the CT DOT microgrant’s support of a small bike recycling program in Willimantic, it highlights the need for a progressive transportation agenda to improve transportation access. 
There are efforts to make Connecticut more public transportation-friendly. The CT House Bill 5390, “Work, Live, Ride,” was reintroduced in 2024  to incentivize dense, walkable infrastructure in transit-oriented districts by allocating funds to build more housing connected to public transportation. 
While public transportation is more comprehensive in denser areas like Hartford or New Haven, what could make transportation more accessible to lower-income individuals in Willimantic and cities across Connecticut? There could be a massive reinvestment in affordable public transportation. The state could establish regional rail between all population centers, as they were connected during the industrial era, and implement fare-free buses within population centers, similar to the ones introduced during the pandemic that increased ridership. 
Baltimore’s Charm City Circulator is a free bus service downtown, but excludes many poorer outlying neighborhoods.  I believe many lower-income people would benefit from these changes. I asked my community college students in Willimantic if they’d like affordable, reliable public transportation over a car, and most of them enthusiastically said yes. It took decades to disinvest in and dismantle most urban streetcars and trains, with public investment in highways and other infrastructure enabling car-driven, segregated suburban sprawl. It will take years of transportation being affordable and reliable for people to depend on to change where they live, work, attend school, and perhaps even get rid of a car.
Intercity trains and intracity buses would entail a shift in urban development and substantial public investment, as seen across Western Europe and around the world. Public transit is a public investment and not a market service. Rider fees don’t cover operational costs. Rising fares in public transit-dense New York City only cover about 25% of operational costs. Bike infrastructure and recycling programs like the one at WAIM can be part of an accessible alternative. Real change to challenge regressive car-centric urban landscapes requires public transit that is accessible, reliable, and affordable.

The Harwood Planning and Zoning Board and City Council voted in favor of the $3 billion Applied Digital data center that seeks to meet the growing demand for artificial intelligence computing. 
The Planning and Zoning Board recommended rezoning a 320-acre area southeast of Harwood from agriculture to light industrial. The City Council then approved a first reading of the zoning change and a building permit for MBN Engineering of Fargo that will work on the project. A second vote by the council is required to finalize the zoning change and the building permit. The votes would likely come at the October meeting.

Harwood Mayor Blake Hankey said the zoning change and data center would help insulate Harwood from development from the north side of Fargo. 
“I’m hoping that’s going to stop Fargo from coming into our backyard,” Hankey said.
Hankey said Fargo is attempting to annex the site that is between Harwood and Fargo, which he believes is illegal. But, if the site were to become part of Fargo, Harwood residents would have to deal with the potential negatives, such as noise and traffic, without the tax benefits, Hankey said. 
The Harwood City Council also formally voted to oppose Fargo’s annexation. Fargo city leaders voted unanimously last month to approve resolutions to annex land north of the city that includes the data center site, The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead reported. The annexation would need approval from Harwood leaders.
Harwood resident Darlene Meyer said she had come around the idea of the data center being built nearby, in part because of Fargo’s intentions. 
She called the Harwood government’s actions “the biggest decision in the history of Harwood.”
After the unanimous vote from the Planning and Zoning Committee, several people in the crowd called out “shame.”  
Texas-based Applied Digital last month announced the project that the company says would add 200 to 300 jobs and tax revenue for the town of about 900 people.
Harwood resident Deb Moug said her research led to some of the negatives of data centers, such as high power consumption and impact on the quality of life. She cautioned leaders to take more time on making decisions. 
“I think people are too anxious to jump on the AI bandwagon without really thinking this through,” she said. 
Some members of the public called for an environmental impact study.

If built, the Harwood center would be Applied Digital’s third project in North Dakota, with its largest data center at Ellendale, a town of about 1,100. 
The Harwood project received a cool reception at a community meeting organized by Applied Digital on Aug. 25. 
Tuesday’s City Council portion of the meeting started with Hankey cutting short comments from a Harwood resident who wanted to criticize how Applied Digital approached the city. Hankey tried to limit the comments to specific to the zoning change and not the Applied Digital business model. 
As residents shouted at the mayor, he asked to have one person removed. Some others left  voluntarily. 
Later in the public hearing, however, Hankey and others made comments about Applied Digital.
After the hearing and before the vote, Applied Digital CEO Wes Cummins and Executive Vice President Nick Phillips took several questions about topics such as traffic flow and utility rates. 
They said they would work with local officials to minimize truck traffic through Harwood. Cummins said there would not be noticeable surges in traffic when workers start and end shifts. 
“It’s a significant number of jobs, but not an overwhelming number of jobs,” he said. 
Phillips also said a recent off-peak rate increase by Cass County Rural Electric Cooperative, which will provide power to the center, is not related to the project. 
They reiterated how North Dakota’s cool climate allows for more energy-efficient data centers than warmer states. 
In announcing the project, Applied Digital said it hoped to break ground yet this month, but Cummins said the company would have to wait for final approval from the city. 
“It’s as soon as we can make it happen,” Cummins said. “We love the weather here for what we do, but it does create some problems for construction.”

Wes Moore (D) and his wife Dawn Moore watch the final moments of the 2024 General Assembly session from the Senate gallery. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A quiet international birthday trip for Gov. Wes Moore’s wife got splashed across a British tabloid over the Labor Day holiday.
A shirtless Moore and his wife Dawn were photographed over the weekend lounging on a yacht owned by George Clooney, the actor and political benefactor, according to The Daily Mail, which broke the story.
The Daily Mail headline had all the bold-typeface subtlety and nuance to be expected from a tabloid from across the pond: “Damning photos burn top Dem’s 2028 plans to the ground as he’s busted half-naked on kingmaker George Clooney’s luxury yacht in ITALY… while his ‘hellhole’ state faces crime apocalypse.”
The publication reported that Clooney and his wife had been in town for a film festival. The couple left the Moores with access to their Lake Como villa — valued at an estimated $100 million.
The trip — described as a personal vacation to a personal friend’s residence — was not listed on Moore’s public schedule.
“The Governor paid for a trip to celebrate his wife’s 50th birthday,” David Turner, Moore’s communications director, said in a statement Tuesday.
Moore did not temporarily leave Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller in charge while he vacationed, according to the governor’s office.

	“The governor was not temporarily unable to perform his duties and therefore did not appoint the lieutenant governor to serve as acting governor in his stead,” Turner said in his statement, in response to questions about Miller’s role. Turner included a link to relevant sections of the Maryland Constitution addressing when a lieutenant governor would assume the duties of the governor.
Republicans made hay of the trip, which drew a sharp attack from the White House.
“The crime crisis ravaging your city is no problem at all when you can jet off to an Italy yacht vacation,” Abigail Jackson, deputy White House press secretary, posted on X. “Unfortunately for residents of Baltimore, this isn’t their reality. Yet, Wes (wannabe President) Moore insists there’s no crime problem and he doesn’t need help!”
Moore and President Donald Trump (R) have been trading barbs over the last week over the state of crime in Baltimore, with Trump hinting again Tuesday that he might send federal troops into Maryland though he did not say when.
The visit also raises questions about Moore’s political future.
Clooney has built a name for himself in politics hosting fundraisers including one for Joe Biden’s failed re-election bid. The Daily Mail said Clooney has expressed some support for a presidential bid by his recent house guest.
In an April interview on CNN, Clooney praised Moore, calling him “a proper leader.”

(Photo by Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission on Tuesday advanced stricter regulations than the board adopted earlier this summer, leaving some advocates feeling more concerned.
All five commissioners voted to amend the emergency regulations that have been in effect since June 29 but were set to expire by the end of September. The new regulations, which would still allow the commission to begin licensing registered medical cannabis establishments by a voter-mandated Oct. 1 deadline, is contingent upon Gov. Jim Pillen’s approval. He approved the first rules in June. Tuesday was the commission’s fourth meeting since June, the first that all commissioners attended.
The revised regulations would, for the first time, set extensive testing and security requirements and establish a “Recommending Health Care Practitioner Directory” for in-state physicians to recommend medical cannabis. If approved, the rules would remain in effect for up to 90 days.

Practitioners participating in the program would have to take 10 hours of continuing education on medical cannabis and complete two hours annually to stay in compliance. Physicians would need to prescribe specific dosages and potency levels. After that, a patient or caregiver could purchase the recommended medical cannabis amount at a specific dispensary only once every 30 days.
Under the regulations, patients or caregivers could purchase up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis in a 30-day period, which is about 142 grams. But they could purchase no more than 5 grams of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) from the same dispensary within a 90-day period. Delta-9 THC is the part of cannabis most associated with a “high.”
The amended requirements maintain a statewide limit of no more than 12 medical cannabis dispensaries, arranged by judicial district. That would mean one dispensary each in Douglas County (584,526 residents), Lancaster County (322,608 residents), Sarpy/Cass Counties (217,202 residents) and Buffalo/Hall Counties (112,979 residents), according to 2020 census data.
The rules would still prohibit dispensaries from selling smoking or vaping products and edibles of any kind. While the earlier rules would have allowed the sale of non-sugarcoated gelatinous cubes, the revised rules would not. Oral tablets with a “thin layer” of flavoring to make the products swallowable would now be allowed.
Under current law, a patient or qualified caregiver with a recommendation from any health care practitioner can legally possess up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis, in any form. But without licensing, cannabis can’t legally be purchased in Nebraska yet.
2024 ballot measures
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, the nonprofit that led the successful 2024 ballot measures to legalize and regulate medical cannabis, said Tuesday’s vote should leave Nebraskans “outraged.”

About 71% of voters in November approved legalization, and about 67% created the Medical Cannabis Commission and “exclusively” vested in it the authority to regulate the drug.
Among Eggers’ frustrations was the board’s decision to limit the number of cultivator licenses and products manufacturer licenses offered to four each. The earlier emergency regulations and state law set no limit.
Eggers told the Nebraska Examiner that commissioners “didn’t just ignore” their voter-mandated regulatory authority, “they shredded it.”
“By approving rules that pile on new barriers and unlawfully restrict forms of cannabis, they are dismantling what the people demanded at the ballot box,” Eggers said in a statement. “This is a direct assault on patients, families and the democratic process itself. Nebraskans voted for access to medicine. 
“Instead, the commission delivered defiance, obstruction and betrayal.”
Confusion over draft regs
The new proposed set of emergency regulations was released quietly late Tuesday morning. The timing left advocates scrambling to understand the changes between an early 20-page set of rules to the new 46-page document.
That’s if the public knew the regulations were ready for review at all, or if they could decipher what the commission intended by releasing two versions of draft regulations: a “Version A” (with 46 pages) and a “Version B with highlights” (47 pages) to be considered at the 1 p.m. hearing.

The commission did not explain the competing drafts before the public comment period, and many advocates told the Examiner they thought “Version B” was the set they should review, given the “highlighted” label and a limited time frame.
Among the major differences: “Version B” would have allowed up to 21 dispensaries rather than 12, with more dispensaries allowed in more populous areas. It also appeared to permit vaping and created a framework of vertical licensing, or the ability for someone to apply for multiple types of licenses.
However, those changes, endorsed by multiple testifiers across the commission’s initial meetings, fell mostly on deaf ears, with only Commissioner Bruce Bailey of Lincoln voicing public support. 
Public weighs in
Eggers, at one point Tuesday, thanked commissioners for listening to Nebraskans about the higher dispensary limit, not yet knowing the board was preparing to go in another direction.
She said limiting cultivators was “counterintuitive” and could break the supply chain “from the start.”
Cody Jester of Fairfield echoed Eggers’ concerns and said he was interested in cultivation. He said he had tried to work with local officials and his local health department, a requirement the first regulations outlined. But the new regulations adopted Tuesday removed that step. Jester said it could take months to grow medical cannabis but that farmers were ready.

Josh Egle from Banner County said he appreciated the commission establishing a lottery system to review licensing applications. But he suggested a hybrid lottery-merit system that could bring in quality candidates but also allow the participation of locals wanting to get involved. 
Denise Wegener of Omaha said the quickest alleviation for her is smoking or vaping marijuana, which she said has given her her life back from a debilitating health condition.
“We’re not just Joe Schmo out here recreationally getting high for fun,” Wegener said. “We’re using this as medication to heal our bodies.”
Several people also again encouraged the commission to view them as patients. Lia Post of Springfield, for instance, told the commission to not listen to Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers and U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., who urged lawmakers not to pass a medical cannabis legislative bill this spring.
That bill, backed by Eggers, Post and other 2024 petitioners, sought to give commissioners more funding, time and support. It fell 10 votes short, leaving the regulatory board to act on its own, with limited funds.
“I’m so glad my life is now in the hands of this Pete Ricketts-Jim Pillen-Mike Hilgers firing squad. Yay,” Post told the commission. “More people who want me and patients like me to die.”

Bill Hawkins of the Nebraska Hemp Company also lambasted the commission for the new health care practitioner directory that would exclude out-of-state recommendations.
“Patients’ rights are still in effect,” said Hawkins, who is again leading a petition effort to legalize recreational marijuana. “There is nothing in the law that says a patient with a recommendation — from any state, any ailment — [has] to buy your poison pill from your dispensary.”
Cultivators and vaping
Bailey echoed the public’s support for more cultivators and for vertical licensing, suggesting more for cultivators, possibly six. He cautioned that one cultivator’s supply chain failure, or a bad crop year, could ripple and cause costs to skyrocket. He also said the growing limit didn’t make sense, adding: “I can’t imagine buying a farm and telling me I can’t grow corn because my neighbor’s growing.”
“You got the funnel upside down,” Bailey said. “We want competition in this world. That’s what free enterprise is about.”

Commissioners Monica Oldenburg of Lincoln and Lorelle Mueting of Gretna said they worried about oversaturation compared to other states. 
But Bailey contended that without competition, Nebraska could create a black market opposite to the commission’s intent and that many cultivators wouldn’t grow product if there wasn’t demand.
Bailey also led the charge to allow vaping products, a stance that Oldenburg, an anesthesiologist and commission chair, and Mueting, an addiction prevention specialist, resisted. The two women had expressed their stance when Pillen appointed them in May.
“Nobody will say that vaping is medicine,” Oldenburg said. “And when I’ve talked to every physician that I know and I ask them this, they really do look at me like I have three heads, like I’m making a funny joke.”
Legal threats
After the back and forth, commissioners entered a closed session for more than an hour to discuss what they described as “strategy for imminent litigation.” 
The commission is currently being sued to overturn the voter-approved laws, with a former state senator mainly arguing the state laws contradict federal law against marijuana. A Lancaster County judge dismissed the case. It is being appealed.

At the same time, Hilgers and his office have threatened to sue the commission when it begins licensing, which could come as early as the commission’s meeting on Sept. 30. He has advanced a similar argument that the voter-approved laws are preempted by federal law.
After emerging from the executive session, Mueting suggested about six changes, roughly what Bailey had suggested, including the change capping cultivators at four, for instance. But commissioners didn’t discuss why they were proposing those specific changes over others.
Mueting also updated a separate regulatory effort to establish a seed-to-sale tracking system without state funds. She said a company Metrc, a cannabis compliance tracking system and software firm, had voiced interest in exploring a self-funded model in which businesses would pay into the Nebraska system instead of paying the commission.
Without legislative approval, the commission can’t accept any fees, fines or funds. In the meantime, the commission will partner with the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, of which Bailey is chair, to share up to $150,000 to cover the cannabis board’s operating expenses. 
‘Knock-down, drag-out process’
The commissions also plan to cooperate in asking lawmakers for sufficient funds next session after lawmakers refused to give the Medical Cannabis Commission its own line item in the state budget.

The commission will prioritize cultivator licenses first. Applications meeting the commission regulations can be emailed to mcc.contact@nebraska.gov or mailed to the Liquor Control Commission between Sept. 4 and Sept. 23.
Despite legal threats and legislative inaction, Eggers and others said voters have given the commission a clear mandate.
“This doesn’t have to be a knock-down, drag-out process, but there is a clear law that was passed,” Eggers told the commission. “I would appreciate, and the patients here and the patients in this state would appreciate you adhering to what the voters passed.”
The Medical Cannabis Commission is scheduled to meet next at 1 p.m. Sept. 30.

(File photo by Josh Kurtz/Maryland Matters)The developer of a planned Maryland offshore wind farm insisted Tuesday that a related steel manufacturing facility in Sparrows Point will move forward, despite the federal government withdrawing a $47.4 million grant for the project last week.
The Sparrows Point Steel Marshalling Project was one of a dozen projects targeted by the U.S. Department of Transportation Friday when it withdrew $679 million in previously approved grants for port and rail infrastructure improvements in support of wind power projects across the country.
In announcing the cuts, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said they were part of a Trump administration effort to slash funding for “doomed” offshore wind farms.
The administration of President Joe Biden “bent over backwards to use transportation dollars for their Green New Scam agenda while ignoring the dire needs of our shipbuilding industry,” Duffy said in a statement Friday. “Thanks to President Trump, we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”
But US Wind, the Baltimore-based wind farm developer behind the Sparrows Point project, was defiant Tuesday. It said the $400 million project planned for nearly 100 acres on the site of the former Bethlehem Steel mill “will continue to move forward, ultimately bringing hundreds of manufacturing jobs to the Baltimore region.”
The company added that steel manufactured on the site would also fuel the shipbuilding industry.
“There continues to be a robust market for steel components for the energy and shipbuilding industries, and US Wind is confident that just as steel has been a key part of the region’s past, Sparrows Point Steel will be an important part of Maryland’s industrial future,” wrote Nancy Sopko, US Wind’s vice president for external affairs, in a statement.
Trump administration plans to revoke federal approval for Ocean City wind farm

The facility is expected to fabricate steel components for wind turbines, including towers and monopiles. In 2023, US Wind inked a “long-term partnership” deal with Haizea Wind Group, a company that focuses on turbine design, manufacturing and assembly, with facilities in Spain’s Basque Country and in France.
Later that year, US Wind announced it had won the grant funding from the federal government for the Sparrows Point project. It said the influx of cash would “help transform the site into a sustainable working waterfront by supporting extensive upgrades needed for large offshore wind components to be staged and transported to offshore wind project sites along the East Coast.”
Duffy said the funding revocation came after a “review of all discretionary grant programs with obligated and unobligated projects” turned up the wind projects “not aligned with the goals and priorities of the administration.”
President Donald Trump has made his intentions clear from the start, beginning with a January executive order pausing new offshore wind leasing activities in federal waters. A group of 18 Democratic attorneys general challenged the order, and the case is set for a hearing in Boston on Thursday.
In a statement Friday, the Oceantic Network, an offshore wind industry group, argued that the port projects defunded by the Trump administration would serve multiple industries, including defense, citing upgrades to the Port of Davisville in Rhode Island and Virginia’s Fairwinds Landing, which were expected to be multiuse sites.
“The Trump administration is weakening our country’s national security and destroying good-paying jobs by pulling critical funding designed to update our aging maritime infrastructure,” said Oceantic CEO Liz Burdock.
US Wind’s own wind farm, planned to be off the coast of Ocean City, has faced its own roadblocks of late.
US Wind won the final federal permit for the Ocean City project in the waning days of the Biden administration, but Trump’s Interior Department indicated in a court filing last week that it intends to revoke the major federal permit for the project that was years in the making.
The Town of Ocean City, which has mounted an aggressive campaign against the US Wind project, had filed a lawsuit targeting that very permit. The federal government argued the town could pump the brakes, since Interior was planning to withdraw the permit anyway.
Ocean City’s mayor and council have also challenged an air pollution permit issued to US Wind by the state of Maryland — one of the last permits that the wind company needed in order to begin construction. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency also weighed in on that state-issued permit, arguing in an unconventional letter that the document should go through an EPA appeals process — as opposed to state courts. Ocean City, accordingly, filed appeals in both places.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Maryland joined 21 states and the District of Columbia on a brief in support of federal labor unions who are suing to block President Donald Trump’s executive order canceling collective bargaining agreements with dozens of federal offices.
The friend-of-the-court brief, filed Friday with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, argues that Trump’s order violates the affected workers’ First Amendment rights and retaliates against them for not adhering with the president’s agenda.
“Federal workers constitute one in ten Maryland jobs, serving our communities in roles such as nurses at veterans’ hospitals, environmental scientists, agricultural inspectors, and administrative support specialists,” Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a statement Tuesday.
“These dedicated public servants deserve a voice in the workplace,” Brown’s statement said. “Without the right to collectively bargain, they risk losing the protections, fair wages, and safe working conditions they need to support their families and serve the public effectively.”
President Donald Trump issued an executive order on March 27 that said labor agreements were being canceled “to enhance the national security.” The agencies targeted ranged from the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security to the Bureau of Land Management and the Federal Communications Commission, according to guidance at the time from the Office of Personnel Management.
Two more agencies cancel union contracts, as FEMA, USCIS end collective bargaining

Trump expanded that list on Thursday with another executive order that added NASA, the commissioner of patents in the Patent and Trademark Office, the National Weather Service and the U.S. Agency for Global Media — which oversees Voice of America — among other agencies.
“The agencies and agency subdivisions set forth in … this order are hereby determined to have as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work,” Trump’s order said.
The American Federation of Government Employees — one of six federal unions that had sued to block Trump’s original executive order — said after Thursday’s order that it will continue to fight.
“AFGE is preparing an immediate response and will continue to fight relentlessly to protect the rights of our members, federal employees and their union,” AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a statement.
U.S. District Judge James Donato issued a preliminary injunction June 24 that blocked implementation of Trump’s order, noting that a White House fact sheet published with the original order called out “hostile Federal unions” that “have declared war on President Trump’s agenda” and are “‘fighting back’ against Trump.”
But the 9th Circuit lifted that injunction, on Aug. 1, saying that Trump’s order “on its face … does not express any retaliatory animus. Instead, it conveys the President’s determination that the excluded agencies have primary functions implicating national security.”
Since then, federal agencies have moved swiftly to end labor agreements with their workers, reclaiming office space from the unions and canceling arbitration and grievance hearings, among other actions.
The Center for American Progress estimates more than 1 million federal workers, representing about 81% of federal labor union membership, are affected by Trump’s executive order
Besides Maryland, other jurisdictions signed on to the brief include the District of Columbia and the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)In 2012, Alaska State Troopers arrested Fairbanks pilot Ken Jouppi and seized his aircraft after charging him with bootlegging for shipping beer into the dry community of Beaver.
Now, after 13 years of legal disputes, the state’s decision to seize Jouppi’s airplane could be headed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Institute for Justice, a libertarian-leaning nonprofit public interest law firm, last week asked the Supreme Court to consider overturning an Alaska Supreme Court ruling from April. That ruling declared that the state’s decision to seize Jouppi’s plane was not an excessive fine for bootlegging.
The “petition for a writ of certiorari” — a formal document asking the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the issue — was filed last week, an official with the Institute confirmed on Tuesday afternoon.
The odds are against Jouppi — the Supreme Court takes only about 1% of the cases it receives. If cases filed with a fee waiver are excluded — those usually come from prisoners representing themselves in a last-ditch appeal — the acceptance rate is 5% or less.
Now 85 and retired, Jouppi was a longtime air taxi pilot in Fairbanks when he planned to ferry a passenger and her groceries from that hub city to Beaver, a village in the Interior.
Before takeoff, an Alaska State Trooper noticed a six-pack of beer visible in the baggage. Beaver had outlawed the sale, consumption and importation of alcohol in 2004. Troopers searched the plane and found three cases of beer — two Budweiser, one Bud Light — intended for the passenger’s husband, the local postmaster.
Jouppi was indicted on bootlegging charges, convicted, and sentenced. His sentence included three days in jail and a fine. State prosecutors asked that he be required to forfeit his plane, but the trial judge declined.
The state appealed that decision, and the Alaska Court of Appeals ruled in 2017 in the state’s favor. The Appeals judges sent the case back to the trial court, which again refused to order the plane’s forfeiture, citing the U.S. Constitution’s excessive fines clause.
The state again appealed, and in 2022, a full decade after the original crime, the Court of Appeals partially ruled in the state’s favor. 
The appeals court ordered additional proceedings by the trial court, but both Jouppi’s attorneys and state prosecutors instead asked the Alaska Supreme Court to take up the issue, which it did last year before issuing a written opinion in April.
“We hold, as a matter of law, that the owner of the airplane failed to establish that forfeiture would be unconstitutionally excessive,” wrote Justice Jude Pate on behalf of the court, which ruled unanimously in the state’s favor.
Pate and the court said that Alaska legislative debates showed that state lawmakers placed a high priority on punishments for bootleggers, and thus the seizure of an airplane was not excessive, even though a relatively small amount of beer was involved.
“Alcohol abuse in rural Alaska leads to increased crime; disorders, such as alcoholism; conditions, such as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder; and death, imposing substantial costs on public health and the administration of justice. Within this context, it is clear that the illegal importation of even a six-pack of beer causes grave societal harm,” the ruling states. “This factor strongly suggests that the forfeiture is not grossly disproportional.”
In their request for the U.S. Supreme Court to examine the case, Jouppi’s attorneys argue that the federal justices should decide whether courts should consider the seriousness of an offense in abstract, or if they should take into account a specific defendant’s circumstances.
The Alaska Supreme Court “examined the gravity of the defendant’s offense at a stratospheric level of abstraction,” they argue, when justices should have taken into account the circumstances.
The Alaska justices relied on a federal decision from the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Jouppi’s attorneys note, but Alaska is within the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Judges for the 9th Circuit have considered the Excessive Fines clause of the Constitution and concluded that it is critical to “review the specific actions of the violator rather than by taking an abstract view of the violation.”
Because of those two differing interpretations of the Constitution, Jouppi’s attorneys say, the case is ripe for the U.S. Supreme Court to consider.
No date has been set for a court conference to determine whether Jouppi’s case will be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
If the court declines to consider his case, the Alaska Supreme Court decision will stand.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/supremecourtoct92024_0-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-02 20:57:10.422624

(Ciattarelli photo by Amanda Burns/Spadea photo by Hal Brown)New Jersey Republicans say radio talk show host and failed gubernatorial candidate Bill Spadea’s return to the airwaves may risk the GOP’s chance to win the governor’s race in November.
Spadea, who resumed his morning talk show on New Jersey 101.5 on Tuesday, prefaced his return by saying he will not endorse Republican Jack Ciattarelli’s gubernatorial bid. Spadea was one of three men Ciattarelli defeated in June’s GOP primary.
Assemblyman Brian Bergen (R-Morris) said he’s concerned that Spadea’s on-air presence will be a “total drain on the Republican Party.” Bergen did not support Spadea’s campaign for governor.
“It’s less about the act of not endorsing Jack,” Bergen told the New Jersey Monitor. “It’s a lack of support for Republicans, the Republican Party, and a Republican gubernatorial candidate in general.”
Former state Sen. Ed Durr is a Republican who briefly campaigned for the GOP nomination for governor before dropping out of the race in March. When Durr ended his gubernatorial campaign, he said he did so to boost Spadea’s chances. Now, he said he wants to see Spadea work to elect Ciattarelli.
Durr joked that Spadea may have his eye on running for governor again in four years, and to do that, “he needs to get Jack out of the way.”
“He’s actually actively participating and campaigning against him, and I think that’s shameful,” Durr said.
Spadea took a break from hosting his four-hour morning show in January amid complaints from some of his GOP rivals, including Ciattarelli, that New Jersey 101.5 was providing Spadea with an improper campaign advantage. His show on Tuesday was light on politics, though he did take a jab at Republicans who supported a Democratic push to allow undocumented immigrants to obtain New Jersey driver’s licenses. Ciattarelli has recently said that if elected, he would ban issuing licenses to undocumented drivers, though in 2021, he expressed support for the idea.
“Criminal aliens are rampant among us, sneaking in to get a driver’s license because some weak Republicans — you know who — and complicit Democrats, you also know who, allow this and push for it,” Spadea said Tuesday.
Bergen, who is seeking reelection in November, stressed he didn’t want to overstate one person’s significance, but said Spadea’s anti-Ciattarelli messaging bothers him because Bergen believes the governor’s race may be won by a “tiny amount of votes.”
“The only way that we won’t get what we want here is if we choose not to put the full effort forward to do it,” Bergen said. “And someone like Bill Spadea — or replace his name with anybody else that’s going to work to disrupt that or complicate that — I have a problem with at this time.”
Ciattarelli is facing Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill in November in the closely watched election, one of just two gubernatorial races nationwide this fall. The two are vying to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who can’t seek a third term in November.
While Sherrill is leading in the polls, Republicans note that many poll respondents remain undecided. Ciattarelli came within three points of unseating Murphy in 2021 despite polls showing Murphy with a much larger lead.
Spadea on Friday said he would not back Ciattarelli because Ciattarelli is “wrong for New Jersey.”

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)State and local education officials welcomed students back to school by announcing more than $111.3 million in land investment revenue will be distributed to schools for the 2025-2026 school year — the largest ever yearly distribution in the state program’s history. 
“I’m proud to share that the Permanent State School Fund has grown from about $50 million in 1994 to $3.7 billion today,” Utah State Treasurer Marlo Oaks said during a news conference Tuesday at Whittier Elementary School in Salt Lake City. 
“This remarkable growth is a result of careful stewardship, prudent administration of trust lands and investment assets, and the foresight of those who established the trust system to support Utah’s education programs now and for years to come,” he said. 
The record $111.3 million distribution comes after Utah voters last year approved a constitutional amendment, Amendment B, which increased the amount that can be distributed from the Permanent State School Fund, an endowment created at statehood to support public schools. 
Approved by voters, Amendment B changed the Utah Constitution to increase the limit of the annual distributions from the fund to public schools from 4% to 5% of the fund. Last year, before the amendment, schools received about $106 million under the 4% distribution cap. 
Amendment B

That 1% change, however, means “beginning in the fall of 2026, schools will have access to even more resources to support students in the classroom, while the fund itself continues to grow for future generations,” Oaks said. “Amendment B helps us to better meet the needs of children today without sacrificing the needs of future students.”
The $111.3 million in LAND Trust funds will support more than 647,000 students in 1,019 schools statewide, distributed on a per-pupil basis, according to the Utah Land Trusts Protection & Advocacy Office. 
“Utah’s School LAND Trust Program is unlike anything else in the nation,” said State Superintendent of Public Instruction Molly Hart. “While other states have school trust lands, Utah has set the gold standard in managing these assets into a $3.7 billion Permanent State School Fund that directly improves education outcomes and learning in every K-12 public school throughout Utah.”
Hart said she’s personally seen how the annual distribution has grown — from $29 million when she first arrived in Utah in 2012 to $111 million for this year’s distribution.

She called that “simply remarkable.” 
“What makes this program so successful and powerful is that the decisions are made locally by school community council members and land trust councils that are made up of principals and teachers and parents and grandparents who know their students best,” Hart said. “This ensures that every single dollar is strategically invested where it will make the greatest impact.”
Utah — one of the fastest growing states that’s also known for large families — struggles to keep pace with education needs. For the 2026 fiscal year, roughly 38% of the state’s $30.8 billion budget went toward public and higher education, according to the state budget. 
However, the state consistently ranks among the lowest in the nation for per-pupil spending. 
Salt Lake City School District Superintendent Elizabeth Grant told Utah News Dispatch the School LAND Trust program makes a “huge difference” by helping provide much-needed funding for schools. 
“Utah schools are very good at making due with what they have, the funding that they get,” she said. “So we use the dollars well.”

How does Utah’s school land trust system work?
Four agencies make up Utah’s School and Institutional Trust System. The Trust Lands Administration manages about 3.3 million acres of trust lands in Utah, granted by Congress at statehood in 1896 with the requirement that revenue earned from the sale or lease of the land be placed into permanent endowment for public schools. The revenue is generated from activities like energy development, real estate and grazing. 
The School LAND Trust program, housed in the State Board of Education, distributes annual investment earnings directly to local schools and empowers communities to decide how best to meet their needs through land trust councils that decide how to spend the money. 
The Utah School & Institutional Trust Funds Office is made up of an independent team of investors tasked with investing the revenue in the Permanent State School Fund to grow the endowment. And the Utah Land Trusts Protection & Advocacy Office ensures the fund’s beneficiaries’ interests — primarily school children — are protected and represented.

How much are schools getting?
Alpine School District — Utah’s most populated — got the biggest distribution, more than $13 million. Davis School District got $10.6 million; Granite and Jordan school districts received more than $8.7 million each; Nebo School District got more than $6.6 million; and Washington District got $5.6 million. Those are just some of the top earners due to their large school populations. 
Salt Lake City School District received more than $3 million in this year’s distribution for more than 19,000 students. Included in that disbursement, Whittier Elementary in Salt Lake City got more than $77,000. 
As part of Tuesday’s celebrations, Oaks presented Whittier Elementary Principal Vanessa Jordan with an oversized check. 
Whittier Elementary school community councils chose to use the $77,000 to support building literacy skills for young students. 
“This year, our land trust funds will provide funding for a part-time certified teacher (and a) paraprofessional who will both support literacy intervention for kindergarten, first grade, and second grade students,” Jordan said. 
Here are some more examples of how schools across the state plan to use their distributions this year, according to state officials: 

Desert Canyons Elementary in Washington County School District plans to use the funds to hire and train paraprofessionals who support reading and math instruction. 
Canyon View Middle in Emery County School District is looking to provide specialized literacy-focused teacher training, technology to identify learning gaps, and an instructional coach. 
Sky View High in Cache County School District intends to expand access to concurrent enrollment, AP classes, and ACT prep with an aim of raising graduation rates and boosting college readiness.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Montana Public Service Commission President Brad Molnar has run into roadblocks in a bid to see documents he said he’s entitled to review — including pushback from a fellow commissioner who does not want to “burden” NorthWestern Energy, the state’s largest energy provider.
Molnar, most recently elected in November 2024, is seeking records in two separate matters before the Public Service Commission.
He wants records related to an internal investigation into allegations he’s been “unprofessional” in his conduct.
Molnar also wants to see NorthWestern Energy contracts related to wildfire mitigation. He said he wants to ensure the utility does not inflate those costs or overcharge customers.
The requests for information by Molnar follow the 2025 approval of House Bill 490, a wildfire mitigation bill.
Separately, they also follow his own announcement in July that the PSC had hired an outside firm for as much as $10,000 to investigate complaints against him in a case that’s since made its way to the Governor’s Office.
Molnar told the Daily Montanan he had a spat with a utility official over his access to the wildfire mitigation contracts.
He said he requested the monopoly company file a motion for protection if it considers any of the information in the contracts to be a “trade secret.”
If granted, such protection would allow commissioners to view the documents but require them to guard the information from public disclosure.
However, in an email obtained by the Daily Montanan Commissioner Annie Bukacek said the Public Service Commission doesn’t have the capacity to review the information Molnar requested.
In the email to the associate general counsel for NorthWestern, Bukacek also said she doesn’t want to add too much work for the utility.
“His (Molnar’s) requests add to your time and therefore the cost of NorthWestern doing business if you have to file a motion for protection of proprietary information,” Bukacek wrote. “I want to make it clear that this commissioner does not support the added burden of Commissioner Molnar’s request. I am not asking for a response from you.”
Conduct the people’s business ‘in the light of day’
Regarding the internal investigation, Molnar has admitted he might lack finesse in his communication at times but has said the concerns raised were better addressed with a conversation than a costly bill to taxpayers.
The PSC also hired a law firm at a rate of $250 an hour.
However, in a complaint to Gov. Greg Gianforte, Commissioner Jennifer Fielder said Molnar is undermining the investigation, and she requested the governor suspend Molnar including for threats of retaliation — an allegation his lawyer has described as “inflammatory.”
Fielder sent the letter on behalf of the PSC “response team” investigating the allegations. In Montana, the governor has the authority to remove a member of the Public Service Commission.
But Molnar has said the accusation he’ll retaliate is confusing.
“I don’t know who brought the complaint yet. I don’t know what I’m accused of. I don’t know who the witnesses are,” he said. “How do I take retribution?”
Molnar also said Fielder wrote him a letter that said his press conference about the investigation could be considered retaliation.
“I said, ‘How is holding a press conference decrying the lack of due process retaliation?” Molnar said.
In a response to the governor, Molnar’s lawyer said Gianforte should have immediately rejected the complaint by Fielder.
Molnar also said he has been denied in his attempt to learn more about it. He learned of the complaint Fielder filed only after general counsel for the governor provided it.
A policy manual identifies the positions typically on the PSC “response team,” including the president.
Molnar told the Daily Montanan he wanted to know who is part of the “response team” handling his investigation and how the complaint to the governor came about.
In an email last Tuesday from the law firm the PSC hired to provide legal advice in the investigation, lawyer Amy Christensen requested Molnar’s lawyer, Matthew Monforton, ask his client to “discontinue” asking PSC staff for information regarding the complaint to the governor.
Wednesday, Monforton told Christensen her directive was “as misguided as it is improper.”
“Commissioner Molnar was duly elected by the people — not appointed by you, not beholden to your ‘Response Team,’ and certainly not subject to your attempts to muzzle him,” Monforton wrote.
Monforton said Molnar has the authority and constitutional obligation to access documents, he won’t be subject to “procedural gamesmanship,” and he will fulfill his elected mandate to ensure “the people’s business is conducted in the light of day, not in the shadows you prefer.”
“Let us be crystal clear about what you are defending: a clandestine complaint dispatched to the governor seeking the suspension of a duly elected official,” Monforton said.
In an email Tuesday, PSC Executive Director Alana Lake said the agency has not yet heard from the Governor’s Office about its complaint, a request Gianforte “take action to allow the investigation to move forward in a lawful manner.”
However, Lake said such requests take time to review “and undergo careful consideration.”
Lake said she could not share details of how the “response team” decided to submit a complaint to the governor given confidentiality requirements in policy, but she said it is “working diligently to ensure the investigation can proceed in a lawful and fair manner.”
The PSC has a work session scheduled Wednesday on the complaint.
‘Why is this even private?’
In the 2025 session, the Montana Legislature adopted HB 490, which requires certain entities such as electric cooperatives and utilities to file wildfire mitigation plans and receive some protection against civil liability for wildfire damages.
The bill requires mitigation plans to include information about inspections and maintenance programs, estimated costs of improvements and upgrades, and other information.
The PSC is charged with approving NorthWestern Energy’s plan. The bill said plans can be approved if they are found to be “in the public interest” and reasonably balance implementation costs with risks of potential wildfire.
Molnar told the Daily Montanan he wants to understand the actual wildfire mitigation costs, having heard estimates of anywhere from $7 million to $70 million.
He said one way to find out is to look at how much NorthWestern Energy is spending on vegetation management currently, including with its own crews.
Molnar said if he can see how much they have spent in the last couple of years, he will understand how much is fair for the PSC to approve in any upcoming case.
“Why is this even private? My god. You’re cutting grass. You’ve been doing it forever,” Molnar said. “From the day you became a utility, you’ve been trimming around your power lines.”
He said NorthWestern Energy told him he could view the documents on site, but he said he wanted to distribute copies to other commissioners. So he said he requested the utility send the documents to him — either email them as a public record or ask for an order of protection.
“They’re so used to having their own way,” Molnar said.
In an email obtained by the Daily Montanan, Bukacek said she disagreed with the “tone, tenor and abject idiocy” expressed by Molnar in his meeting with NorthWestern. She also said she did not believe HB 490 requires NorthWestern to provide the information Molnar requested.
Molnar told the Daily Montanan he wants to see the information to do his job as a regulator — unlike Bukacek, he said.
“If there was such a thing as treason in the Public Service Commission, she would be saying, ‘I regret I have but one life to live for the utilities that I regulate,’” Molnar said.
On Aug. 25, NorthWestern filed a motion requesting an order of protection for the contracts, arguing public disclosure would harm its ability to negotiate with vendors and get the best deals for its customers.
The PSC has yet to take action on the motion, but Molnar said he would not fight a protective order.
At the PSC meeting Tuesday, energy transition engineer Nick Fitzmaurice with the Montana Environmental Information Center also expressed interest in ensuring customers don’t pay too much for wildfires.
Fitzmaurice said the law gives the PSC the authority to appoint a “technical master” with expertise to review the wildfire mitigation plan, and it should do so for a “robust review.”
“This will be essential to protect Montanans from the risks of utility-sparked wildfire and to ensure we are not on the hook for damages should NorthWestern’s measures be insufficient to prevent the utility’s infrastructure from igniting a wildfire,” Fitzmaurice said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Molnar1-1024x677.jpg,,,2025-09-02 20:57:10.422624

Some cities are ramping up efforts to ticket and tow vehicles that shelter homeless Californians.


For months, cities around the state have ramped up enforcement against people sleeping in tents on the street. Now, some are focusing on a new target: People who live in vehicles. 
Wayne Gardiner, 58, watched his home of 20 years roll onto the back of a flatbed tow truck in San Jose on a recent Monday afternoon. Then he realized he’d forgotten something inside.
He threw open compartments in the bottom of the RV as fast as he could, looking for the pressure-washing tools he uses for cleaning jobs to make extra money. As the RV rose up onto the truck, about to head off to a junk yard, Gardiner found the black backpack full of tools and pulled it out. 
Then he stood back with his rottweiler, Buddy, and some of his possessions in green trash bags at his feet, and watched the truck drive away. He held his emotions in check.
“If I get myself involved with that, I’ll be a wreck,” Gardiner said. “I gotta let it go.”
San Jose is towing vehicles from different areas of the city in a new effort to rid the streets of lived-in vehicles. Last month, it started clearing its largest homeless encampment – a makeshift city in Columbus Park, where Gardiner and hundreds of other people had been sleeping in cars, RVs and tents. 
San Francisco passed a new policy this summer banning large vehicles from parking on any city street for more than two hours — effectively making it illegal to live in an RV on the street. 
Even smaller cities, including Carlsbad outside of San Diego, and San Mateo in the Bay Area, have adopted new policies targeting people living in cars and RVs. 
The issue has attracted the attention of state legislators as well. Assembly Bill 630, which cleared another legislative hurdle Friday, would make it easier for certain cities to dispose of RVs parked on their streets. 
“We have stories from people who have inoperable RVs that are parked in their neighborhoods, under freeways, that they know are ground-zero for drugs, for prostitution rings, for other criminal activities that are happening there,” said the bill’s author, Assemblymember Mark Gonzalez, a Los Angeles Democrat. “So what we’re trying to do is address this issue head-on.”
The push comes as rows of RVs and lived-in cars line streets in cities across the state, frustrating voters and creating issues with trash, waste water and traffic visibility. The number of lived-in vehicles on San Francisco’s streets has risen over the past year — from 474 in July 2024 to 612 in June 2025, even as the number of tents dropped from 319 to 165, according to the city’s count.
Vehicle homelessness can be more difficult for cities to manage than tent encampments. People often are reluctant to give up the safety and security of their RV or car in exchange for a temporary shelter bed or short-term housing. And many cities have nowhere to store RVs, and nowhere for them to park legally.

Advocates for the rights of unhoused Californians say doling out punishment to deal with the issue will make the homelessness crisis worse. When cities tow lived-in cars and RVs, their owners often can’t get them back because they can’t pay the towing and storage fees, said Eleana Binder, public policy director for GLIDE, which serves San Franciscans living in homelessness and poverty. They end up with nowhere else to go.
“It does increase street homelessness, because people are right on the edge,” she said. “For a lot of people, a vehicle is their only asset, their last step before street homelessness.”
Tickets and tows
Ordinances that regulate homeless encampments often target people sleeping in tents, not vehicles. As a result, police have used parking ordinances to try to clear vehicle encampments by giving tickets and either towing or threatening to tow. But that approach doesn’t take into account the fact that the cars and RVs are people’s homes. 
In some places, new policies that specifically address people living in cars and RVs try to address that problem by providing services as well as tickets and tows.
Gardiner, who watched the city of San Jose tow his home, was luckier than many. The city paid him $2,000 for his RV, as part of a pilot program intended to convince people to give up their vehicles and move indoors. He also got a free hotel room, where the city told him he could stay for up to a year.
Gardiner was one of several hundred people living in San Jose’s largest encampment — a sprawling collection of RVs, cars and tents scattered across a rutted, dirt field in Columbus Park and spilling onto surrounding streets. City crews began clearing the camp in August, and have towed 78 vehicles and moved 128 people indoors, according to the city.
The city estimates 370 people lived at Columbus Park when the operation started, but advocates say it was more. And not everyone has been offered the $2,000 buy-back program, a motel stay or other help. 
Valerie Vallejos, who lives in her van at Columbus Park while she studies cosmetology at San Jose City College, said she was visiting her children in Stockton when outreach workers came to the park offering people services. Now she’s trying to get on the list, hoping to get a housing placement or at least a reprieve from threats of towing. So far, she’s had no luck. 
“I’m going to keep coming back out until I get something,” she said. “It’s my only option. What else can I do?”
San Jose is cracking down in other places, too. Officials launched a pilot program earlier this year that bans oversized and lived-in vehicles in certain parts of the city. The city first posts signs and puts up flyers warning people to move their vehicles, then tows if people don’t move. Since January, the city has towed 19 RVs and trailers and 45 other vehicles, according to its online dashboard. But many vehicles return after the enforcement blitz. To date, the city has completed enforcement in 38 “tow-away zones,” where there were a total of 1,175 cars and RVs. Ninety days after that enforcement, 671 vehicles had returned to those locations.

It’s kind of scary, you know,” said Vallejos. “It’s just sad. It’s just sad.” Photo by Florence Middleton for CalMatters
“It’s a start,” said San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan, who acknowledged that towing won’t magically make street homelessness disappear. But he said even forcing RVs to move temporarily can help mitigate the problems the city has seen in long-standing encampments, such as methamphetamine labs, fires and the accumulation of dilapidated, abandoned vehicles.
“This is about providing relief to neighbors and small businesses that have had permanent RV encampments for years on end,” Mahan said.
Since the beginning of the year, San Jose has enforced three “tow-away zones” in the blocks around Barnard Avenue where 51-year-old Esmeralda Herrera lives in a parked trailer with her elderly dog, Kiba. She lost her job as a janitor for the Santa Clara County school district during the COVID-19 pandemic, and then a rent increase drove her out of her apartment.
Herrera is on a waitlist for affordable housing, but she hasn’t seen any progress, she said. In the meantime, Herrera said she bounces all over the city, moving to a new block every time the police threaten to tow her trailer. She’s afraid to leave for job interviews, because she worries that when she gets back, the trailer and her beloved dog will be gone. 
“I don’t know what I would do,” she said. “I don’t want to be in the street.”

‘Public road is not permanent housing’
San Francisco is set to begin enforcing its new RV parking rules this fall. Like San Jose, it plans to pay people to give up their RVs. In addition, people can get a temporary reprieve from towing if they agree to work with a case manager on a housing plan. But only people who have been on the city’s radar since May 2025 are eligible.
“I’m really worried that people are going to end up slipping through the cracks of the permit program, or losing their permit and getting towed,” Binder said. “And for so many people, getting towed means ending up on the streets. That’s my biggest fear: That we’ll see people suffering and more people ending up on the street that weren’t before and don’t have to be.”
In March, Carlsbad expanded its camping ban to include sleeping in vehicles on public property — an infraction that carries a $100 penalty for a first offense, a $200 penalty for a third offense, and a $500 penalty for subsequent offenses. Since the change, the city has issued 34 vehicle camping citations and 77 oversized vehicle parking citations, and towed 12 vehicles, said Mandy Mills, the city’s director of housing and homeless services.
The city received a $3 million state grant to help people living in vehicles move indoors, both by paying for temporary housing subsidies and funding the salaries of two outreach workers to connect people with housing. 
In San Mateo, sleeping in a vehicle on public streets has been illegal since the 1990s. But it wasn’t enforced. In June, City Council voted to start giving people tickets after they refused two offers of shelter.
“The public road is not permanent housing,” said City Manager Alex Khojikian. 
Gonzalez’s bill was intended to help cities like San Mateo clean up their streets. The bill cleared the Senate Appropriations Committee on Friday with a last-minute amendment that limits its scope to Alameda and Los Angeles counties. 
The bill would give cities in those counties more freedom to dispose of abandoned or inoperable RVs. Under current law, a city can trash abandoned RVs valued at $500 or below, but anything more valuable is sold at auction. Someone else can buy that RV and return it to the street, Gonzalez said. 
Gonzalez’s bill would raise that threshold to $4,000, allowing cities to more easily junk RVs and get them off the street for good.

You have to take the deal because they’re gonna take it anyways,” he said. “I have to just let it go.” Photo by Florence Middleton for CalMatters
While Gonzalez says his legislation wouldn’t target RVs in which people are currently living, the bill doesn’t define what makes a vehicle “abandoned.” Opponents, including the California Public Defenders Association, worry that will allow cities to tow too broadly, and remove much-needed shelter from California’s homeless population. 
A separate piece of legislation, Senate Bill 692, would have lowered a different threshold cities have to meet before they can tow “abandoned or inoperable” vehicles. The bill, by Oakland Democratic Sen. Jesse Arreguín, is dead for this year, but may move forward again next year, as Arreguín says he will continue to work with stakeholders on amendments.
In the meantime, in San Jose, Herrera will continue bouncing around the city’s streets with her dog.

In a decision that drew immediate pushback, the Montana Public Service Commission voted unanimously Tuesday against declaring the constitution requires it to consider the adverse impacts of climate change in its work.
The PSC also disagreed it must consider climate in a set of statutes outlined in a petition filed in February 2024 by more than 40 Montana businesses and organizations.
For one thing, the order said making such a declaration would exceed the authority of the Public Service Commission. It said the PSC exercises powers granted by the Montana Legislature, and it is “an administrative agency.”
“It is well established that the Montana Constitution does not allow administrative agencies to issue declarations interpreting the Constitution,” the order said.
The decision elicited quick criticism from the Montana Environmental Information Center and other organizations that petitioned the PSC to consider climate costs including health detriments in its regulation of gas and electric utilities.
“It’s frustrating that this process has dragged on for so long at the PSC just for it to continue avoiding its legal obligation to consider climate change,” said Nick Fitzmaurice, MEIC energy transition engineer.
He said the Montana Constitution is clear, and the state Supreme Court decision in Held vs. Montana “reaffirmed that our right to a clean and healthful environment includes a right to a stable climate.”
He said the MEIC and its fellow petitioners would be exploring their options for how to ensure the PSC “upholds its obligation to protect customers and their utility bills” by considering climate change.
The Supreme Court affirmed in December 2024 that Montanans have a constitutional right to “a clean and healthful environment” in the historic Held decision.
The majority found a law limiting analysis of greenhouse gas emissions during environmental reviews violates the Montana Constitution’s right to a clean environment and stopped the state from acting on it.
But PSC chief legal counsel Lucas Hamilton said that doesn’t mean Public Service Commissioners can make the declarations the MEIC and others want them to make.
Hamilton said “a long line” of Montana Supreme Court cases says that constitutional questions are properly answered by district courts, not administrative officers, like the PSC.
And the right to a clean and healthful environment isn’t the only right that comes up in utility cases, Hamilton said.
“The right to a clean and healthful environment appears alongside other, equally important inalienable rights in the Montana Constitution,” the order said.
For example, Hamilton said Montanans also have the “right to pursue life’s basic necessities,” and the PSC handles questions that address multiple rights.
“In the context of utility service, utilities often provide the means for pursuing life’s basic necessities, right? This is water service. This is sewer service. Heat and light that keeps life going on in a cold state like Montana in certain months of the year.”
The Public Service Commission regulates monopoly utilities, including NorthWestern Energy.
The groups calling on the PSC to consider the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions had argued it has “the most consequential role” on climate impacts given it could promote or discourage investments in fossil-fuel infrastructure.
The groups argued that taking climate into consideration would benefit customer bills, help children who suffer from the effects of bad air, support businesses, such as ski hills, and boost the Montana economy and recreation culture.
In a statement provided by the MEIC, Bridger Bowl Ski Area’s Hiram Towle said the PSC’s decision “further delays a true financial analysis of energy in Montana.”
“As a business responsible for stewarding natural resources, we prioritize protecting the land and maintaining stable operations for current and future generations,” said Towle, general manager. “Climate change and its impact on utility affordability, reliability, and the environment, poses a serious threat.”
In a statement, lawyer Barbara Chillcott, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center, said the PSC should meet its responsibility to the public including the safety of children from wildfires, floods and drought.
“The PSC lists its functions as ensuring ‘ratepayers have continued access to utility services that are affordable, reliable, and sustainable for the long-term,’” Chillcott said. “By its own definition, the commission must take a hard look at how any of its decisions can help blunt the worsening effects of climate-fueled hardships that Montanans are suffering.”
At the meeting, PSC President Brad Molnar and Commissioner Annie Bukacek praised staff for their work on the order — for “brilliant” work and “arduous” effort, Bukacek said.
Molnar said he appreciated the tightly written order by staff, especially because he believes the decision will end up in court.
“I will remind all that this is one step,” Molnar said.
The group had also requested the PSC adopt rules to consider climate costs in the future, and that portion of its petition is pending.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/600x200-PSC.jpg,,,2025-09-02 19:57:11.552465

(Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries photo)Hunters and competitive shooters will get a break on a variety of purchases this weekend during the Second Amendment Weekend Sales Tax Holiday, which runs Friday through Sunday.
Items that qualify for a break on sales taxes are firearms, ammunition and specified hunting supplies, including archery items, hunting apparel and certain types of knives, according to the Louisiana Department of Revenue (see all exemptions). Binoculars, hearing protection, range finders, decoys, hunting stands and blinds also qualify.   
The tax exemption only applies to consumer firearm purchases and not commercial or business transactions. The break also doesn’t apply to animal feed, hunting dogs, off-road vehicles and vessels such as airboats, which were allowed under previous versions of the sales tax holiday.
All sales tax holidays were suspended in 2018 when Louisiana was dealing with a budget shortfall. The return of the 2nd Amendment Sales Tax Holiday last year ended that reprieve, but lawmakers have refused to add any more exemptions.  
Louisiana first approved a 2nd Amendment tax break in 2009 and most recently amended its guidelines in 2023.
An annual back-to-school sales tax holiday was proposed in this year’s legislative session, but it was never brought up for consideration in committee. 
Louisiana previously offered a sales tax holiday for hurricane preparedness, but it also predated the seven-year pause on all such suspensions in 2018. 
The liberal-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy issued a research brief in July that found sales tax holidays will cost states a combined $1.7 billion in lost revenue this year. It called the incentive “poorly targeted and too temporary to meaningfully change the regressive nature of a state’s tax system.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Shotgun_Shooting1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-02 19:57:11.552465

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) In the 15 years since the Jordan River Commission was established, the river that cuts through Salt Lake County has undergone a major transformation. 
What started as a scattered trail system through a weak riparian ecosystem, interrupted by tracts of industrial land, is now a 50 mile paved trail that spans much of the Wasatch Front. More than 25 new access and portage ramps have been constructed for boaters, while the Legacy Nature Preserve offers about 2,000 acres of protected habitat. 
Someone can now ride a bike from Provo to Ogden, spanning three counties and 16 towns, while the Jordan River Water Trail allows boaters to access most of the river, which stretches from Utah Lake to Farmington Bay. 
“Great cities have great rivers,” said Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson. “And I’m proud of this river and the cities in my county that have stepped up.”

Wilson spoke during a media event Friday, commemorating the 15th anniversary of the Jordan River Commission, and kicking off September’s Get to the River festival, a monthlong celebration that includes a beer garden at the Fisher Mansion, educational lectures, nature walks, art exhibits and more. Events are hosted from Saratoga Springs to North Salt Lake. 
Despite the progress, sections of the Jordan River Trail continue to be a hotbed for homeless encampments, drug activity and environmental degradation, prompting Salt Lake City Police to issue a partial closure this year to address public safety concerns. That closure was lifted in July, though officers are still patrolling sections of the trail in Salt Lake City.

The Jordan River Commission started in 2010 with an agreement among local stakeholders and governments — now, more than 40 partners have signed on, including local, state and federal agencies, businesses, nonprofits and all 16 cities and three counties along the river, a major milestone for the commission. 
“More communities signed on, more partners joined in and the progress went faster than anyone could have imagined,” said Cory Rushton, a former West Valley City councilmember and former Jordan River Commission governing board chair.
That progress is on display at the Legacy Nature Preserve, an effort spearheaded in part by the Nature Conservancy along the river in North Salt Lake, Wood Cross and Bountiful. The 2,000-acre preserve was once an industrial area, littered with debris and trash and criss-crossed by access roads. 
Crews removed more than 9,000 tires when cleaning up the site, which had been used as erosion control. 
Now, the area is returning to its original state — a lush riparian corridor lines the river and the preserve’s ponds and wetlands, providing habitat for birds and other animals. The preserve is closed to the public, but boaters can experience it from the river. 
“All of these different habitats allow an amazing assortment of birds and other wildlife to use the legacy preserve as a place to rest, nest and migrate through,” said Andrea Nelson, a community engagement manager for The Nature Conservancy in Utah. 
The preserve is just one example of the river corridor’s transformation over the last 15 years which, according to Don Shelton, is a result of the Jordan River Commission’s dedication to its mission. 
“It’s just remarkable to me what has been able to be accomplished by a group that does not have any land use authority, does not have any statutory authority, but has persuasion, vision and persistence,” said Shelton, a South Jordan councilmember and current Jordan River Commission governing board chair.

Saira Draper, an Atlanta Democrat, speaks in front of former CDC employees and allies at the Georgia State Capitol on Sept. 2, 2025. Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is in turmoil following the ouster of the agency’s director, a series of high-profile resignations, and an attack on its headquarters that killed a police officer, said former CDC staff Tuesday.
The former employees, including ex-deputy director for program and science and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Deb Houry and former director of the National Center for Emerging Zoonotic and Infectious Diseases Dr. Dan Jernigan — who both resigned Thursday — described the current environment at the CDC as a “death” where science is currently being sidelined by political ideology. Houry and Jernigan joined Georgia House and Senate Democrats at the State Capitol Tuesday to discuss the current climate at the CDC.
“You can almost see this as death by a thousand cuts: we’re cutting staff, we’re cutting resources, we’re undercutting science,” said Jernigan.

Jernigan said during a roundtable discussion before talking to the press that there has been an overall lack of transparency between the Trump administration and the CDC, saying that he has seen a shift in the CDC’s operations. Whereas past administrations, regardless of their political leanings, worked with scientists to let data guide policy, Jernigan said the current approach appears to start with a predetermined ideology and then attempts to find scientific justification to support it.
“I recognize you really can’t get politics completely out of public health. [Public health is] really a priority here. What are you putting first? And we’re asking that science go first before the policy development, and not starting with an ideology and then backing into the science,” Jernigan said.
The former CDC employees also tied the current political climate to the recent shooting at the CDC campus, which they said was fueled by years of misinformation about vaccines. Abby Tighe, who was fired from the CDC in May and is a founding member of Fired But Fighting, a coalition of terminated CDC employees and allies, said it’s “tragic to not have a stronger condemnation of this act of violence” and warned that without officials speaking out against the attack, she fears attacks on the scientific community could continue to happen.
“That could look like more attacks, and with the vaccine misinformation being the driver for this, who’s to say that this won’t lead to attacks at pediatricians’ offices or pharmacies or all of these places where vaccines are given and professionals who work in the vaccine space exist,” Tighe said.
CDC employees on Thursday were told they have to return to the office by Sept. 15, according to an email obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, just over a month after nearly 200 rounds of ammunition hit six separate CDC buildings. The building is still being repaired, but Lynda Chapman, chief operating officer who sent the notice, stated in the letter that an “alternative on-campus space” will be provided to those whose office “remains impacted.”
Houry said she left the agency because she “could no longer fight on the inside.” She expressed deep concern over decisions that she said were not being made based on data and science, as well as the loss of talented staff. She said that while she was tasked with sunsetting certain programs during her time, she did her best to archive data so that it could be “resuscitate[d]” if funding is restored.
“If there’s a surveillance system that doesn’t have funding or people, we cannot produce that data. But as we were facing sunsetting a lot of those programs, [we] did what we could to preserve it because we are hopeful that at some point we’ll be able to rebuild our agency,” Houry said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PXL_20250902_160405061-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-09-02 19:57:11.552465

Republican first selectmen are running as challengers in Oxford and Plainfield after losing their party endorsements, one with a twist: The GOP in Plainfield snubbed their incumbent in favor of a Democratic predecessor.
The Democratic primaries are in Bloomfield, Bridgeport, Chester, Hamden, New Britain, New Haven, New London, North Haven, Norwalk, Stamford and Stratford.
The GOP races are in Greenwich, Griswold, Haddam, Oxford, Plainfield, Sterling, Thomaston, Voluntown, Waterbury and Wolcott.
Bridgeport has contests for Democratic nominations for four council seats, including two held by politicians who were targets of elections complaints relating to the absentee ballot scandal in the 2023 mayoral race, Aidee Nieves and Maria Pereira.
Nieves, the council president, was endorsed by the Democratic Town Committee. Pereira is seeking renomination as a challenger.
Warring Democratic factions in the Hartford suburb of Bloomfield are continuing a long-running feud with full slates of endorsed and challenging candidates for council, school board, town plan and zoning commission, and library trustee.
Most of the primaries are for scattered down-ballot offices, not mayor or first selectman. There are no mayoral primaries this year in Stamford or New Haven, the two largest cities with mayoral elections in November.
In the eastern Connecticut town of Plainfield, Republicans endorsed Paul Sweet, a former Democratic first selectman, over Kevin M. Cunningham, the Republican incumbent. Cunningham is waging a primary against Sweet.
Cunningham is facing complaints of mismanagement.
The Day of New London reported a week ago that the local police union passed a vote of no confidence in the offices of the first selectman and finance department over repeated errors in paychecks.
The neighboring communities of Sterling and Voluntown also have GOP primaries for open first selectmen seats. Myron “Jack” Joslyn, the endorsed candidate in Sterling, is challenged by Kimberly Gunn and Frank M. Bood. Brian Muschiano is the endorsed candidate in Voluntown, challenged by Christopher A. Wilson.
In Oxford, a Naugatuck Valley community hard hit by flooding a year ago, First Selectman George Temple lost the GOP endorsement to his former protege, Jeffrey Luff.
Hamden, where Democratic Mayor Lauren Garrett is not running, has a five-way Democratic mayoral primary. The council president, Dominique Baez, is the endorsed candidate. She is challenged by Peter Cyr, Lushonda D. Howard, Walter L. Morton IV, and Adam Sendroff.
There is a two-way race in Norwalk for the Democratic nomination to succeed Mayor Harry Rilling, a Democrat. The council president, Barbara Smyth, is the endorsed candidate; Darlene Young, a council member, is the challenger.
In Wolcott, two Republicans are vying for the right to oppose Thomas G. Dunn, an unaffiliated candidate who has been unopposed in four consecutive races. The endorsed candidate is James Paolino; the challenger, Paul D’Angelo.
In Stratford, two Democrats are seeking the nomination and the right to oppose Republican Mayor Laura Hoydick. The endorsed candidate is David Chess; the challenger, Linda Manos.
Chester’s Democratic first selectwoman, Cynthia Lignar, was endorsed by the her town committee, but faces a primary challenge from Joe Cohen, a public affairs consultant and former Hartford Courant reporter.
Primary day is Tuesday, Sept. 9. Polls will be open from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m. 
Hours for early voting generally are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., with extended hours of 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 2 and Thursday, Sept. 4.

(Photo submitted by the campaign.)The mayor of one of Pennsylvania’s largest cities announced her candidacy for Congress on Tuesday.
Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, said she’s seeking her party’s nomination for the 8th Congressional District in 2026 in an effort to challenge U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R-Luzerne).
“I’m running for Congress because people here deserve a lot better than a rich kid, disrespecting our hard work and proud legacy,” Cognetti said in a campaign ad. “We can stand tall against a Washington that takes advantage of working people and make it work for us. People deserve a future they can believe in and a government that works as hard as they do, always.”
Bresnahan was elected to Congress last year by defeating Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright by roughly 1.5 points. The freshman lawmaker is currently one of four GOP incumbents in Pennsylvania that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) is aiming to flip in 2026.
Cognetti was elected mayor of Scranton in 2019 as an Independent after Democratic incumbent Mayor Bill Courtright resigned from office after pleading guilty to federal bribery, conspiracy, and extortion charges. Her victory in 2019 made her the first woman elected mayor of Scranton and she secured re-election in 2021 as a Democrat. Earlier this year, she cruised to victory in the Democratic Party primary and is running for re-election in November.
In her campaign launch video, Cognetti also criticized Bresnahan’s stock trades as a member of Congress.
Cognetti is the first Democrat to enter the race in the 8th Congressional District and announced that she has the support of Cartwright, Lieutenant Gov. Austin Davis, and U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio (D-Allegheny).
“By jumping into a congressional race before even wrapping up her re-election bid for mayor, Paige Cognetti is showing voters exactly where her true priorities lie,” National Republican Congressional Committee Spokesman Reilly Richardson said.

(Screen capture from Sarnecki's campaign announcement video)TOPEKA — Businessman Philip Sarnecki said he was weary of Republicans losing Kansas campaigns for governor to Democrats, she he decided to try to fix the problem himself.
He said he was joining a group of candidates seeking the Kansas Republican Party’s nomination that was dominated by “career politicians.” The GOP list included former Gov. Jeff Colyer, Senate President Ty Masterson, Secretary of State Scott Schwab and Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt.
The 2026 campaign will decide who replaces term-limited Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. She’s been governor since defeating Republican Kris Kobach  in 2018. In her 2022 campaign for reelection, she beat Republican Derek Schmidt.
“President Donald Trump won Kansas in a landslide the last three elections, but Republicans keep losing in Kansas,” Sarnecki said in a campaign announcement Tuesday. “That is over. We’re going to win and we’re going to win big.”
Sarnecki, who lives in Johnson County, is retired after 30 years in the financial services industry. He was managing partner of Northwestern Mutual, which had offices in 18 states.
He vowed not to “play by the old political rules. I can’t be bought. And, I refuse to let Democrats rewrite Kansas’ future.”
Sarnecki said that as governor he would support Trump, help create good-paying jobs, lower taxes for individuals and businesses, expand parental rights in education and shrink government red tape so businesses had more opportunity to grow.
In addition, Sarnecki blamed “poor Republican leadership” for high corporate income taxes and property taxes.
He said there wasn’t enough affordable housing for young Kansans. Employers, he said, were irresponsibly advancing diversity, equity and inclusion policies in the workplace.
“This is what the career politicians in Kansas have brought us: Incompetence and losing,” he said.
Democrats running for governor include state Sens. Ethan Corson and Cindy Holscher, both of Johnson County.
“Today’s Democratic leaders are lost souls,” Sarnecki said. “They can’t figure out the difference between illegal immigration and legal immigration. They can’t figure out the difference between criminals and victims of crime.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Philip-Sarnecki-for-governor-1.png,,,2025-09-02 18:57:04.196966

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas public libraries will receive their usual allotments of state funding for the first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year, a Department of Education attorney told the new State Library Board during its first meeting Tuesday.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders appointed six new members to the board in August and has yet to appoint a seventh and final member. Gubernatorial appointed boards are allowed to meet before receiving Senate approval, and education department attorney Daniel Shults said Tuesday’s meeting was strictly organizational.
The Arkansas State Library is under the umbrella of the Department of Education but operates independently, and the board’s primary responsibility is to disburse state funds to local public libraries. The new members did not vote on library funding or any other matters and will be able to vote and set policy after being confirmed, Shults said.
Sanders signed a law in April mandating the removal and replacement of the previous State Library Board members, three of whom she had appointed since taking office in 2023. The law required her to call a meeting of the new board by Wednesday at the latest.
The overhaul came after the previous board clashed for more than a year over whether it should withhold funding from libraries that do not restrict minors’ access to “sexually explicit” content. Both state and local elected officials have tried to regulate public library leadership, funding and content for the past few years.
Act 903 of 2025 required the seven new board members to draw lots determining how their terms will be staggered, ending between one and seven years from now. Subsequent appointees would serve seven-year terms, the usual length of time library board members serve.
Challenges to public library funding throughout Arkansas meet frustration, some resistance

The six members drew the following terms:

One year for Clay Goff of Beebe
Three years for Sydney McKenzie of Rogers and Jack Fortner of Yellville
Five years for Emmaline Pilkington and Annette Bailey
Seven years for Lynlee McMillan and the board’s to-be-appointed seventh member

The new board unanimously selected Goff as chairman and McKenzie as vice chairman. Goff previously chaired the White County Regional Library System’s governing board for 11 years, and McKenzie is the only previous State Library Board member reappointed so far, having joined the board in January.
McKenzie and Pilkington are both married to Republican members of the state House of Representatives. Fortner is a former Republican representative who served four terms before declining to run for reelection in 2024.
McMillan is Sanders’ director of constituent services. Bailey and her husband are the co-founders of Mountain Home’s Twin Lakes Baptist Church.
Shults and other Department of Education officials led the new board through an overview of its responsibilities and regulations Tuesday.
In response to a question from Fortner, State Librarian Jennifer Chilcoat said the board doesn’t “have governing control” over public libraries. Besides funding libraries, the board is also responsible for appointing the State Librarian.
McMillan asked Education Secretary Jacob Oliva what the state’s priorities are for the board. Oliva said literacy is a priority for the department. Sanders’ signature legislation of 2023 was the LEARNS Act, an education system overhaul that included literacy coaches in elementary schools.
“We know that a strong, robust literacy program grounded in phonics, phonemic awareness, fluency and vocabulary leads to better comprehension,” Oliva said. “Libraries can have part of that same conversation if they’re working with their families and their parents and making sure that we have access to a great, rich literacy environment.”
The Senate meets quarterly to confirm gubernatorial appointments, and its most recent meeting was Aug. 15. The State Library Board’s next meeting will be Nov. 14.

They are now voting on new agreements that would get them pay hikes. (Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Thousands of state government and community college employees in Washington are considering a new pact that would secure raises they lost out on in July when state lawmakers did not fund their contract.
Nearly 5,300 members of the Washington Public Employees Association didn’t get a 3% pay hike other state workers received July 1 because they failed to approve their two-year deal in time for lawmakers to account for it in the state budget.
Now, association members are voting on a revised accord that, if ratified and funded by the Legislature next year, would boost their salaries 3% retroactively and provide a year’s worth of back pay.
The ratification vote began Aug. 22 and will end Sept. 14. Union officials said they would wait to see the results before commenting.
By law, public sector unions in Washington must approve a new contract by Oct. 1 to be considered by a governor for funding in the ensuing two-year budget.
The 2025-27 budget funded multiple contracts that provide pay hikes of 3% on July 1 and 2% next July. These agreements contain other salary-related changes including raising the starting wage for state workers to $18 an hour.
But Washington Public Employee Association members overwhelmingly voted down a tentative agreement with the pay hikes last fall. Association negotiators derided the proposal as a pay cut, saying it would not allow worker salaries to keep pace with rising costs. They also warned then that rejecting the accord would put them in “uncharted territory.”
Those affected work at 14 community colleges and in nine state agencies. Among them are the Department of Natural Resources, Department of Revenue, the Liquor and Cannabis Board and Department of Agriculture.
Negotiators for the association and the Office of Financial Management did resume talks last winter and eventually reached a tentative agreement in March containing virtually the same economic terms as those turned down. Union members ratified it April 3, just three weeks before the legislative session ended.
Since session ended, the union bargaining team was engaged in “one of the most difficult negotiation periods” in the association’s history before reaching the tentative agreement now getting voted on, according to a post on the association website.
“While we didn’t win everything we fought for, significant gains were made — and harmful proposals were defeated,” officials wrote online.
State government and community college employees are voting on separate agreements. Both would take effect July 1, 2026, and cover the second year of the biennium. Each offers a path for workers to get the 3% doled out this year plus a 2% wage hike next year.
The primary difference concerns who is eligible to receive back pay.
Under their deal, those working in state government would receive the 3% pay bump awarded in July plus retroactive compensation – even if they are no longer working for the state on July 1, 2026. According to the union, the state wanted to limit back pay to only those employees on the payroll as of July 1, 2026.
But not every community college employee is assured back pay under their tentative deal.
Those employed on July 1, 2026, would receive the 3% bump and retroactive pay. Anyone who is laid off, loses their job due to a disability or retires would also be eligible. But those who leave on their own before the start of the contract would not.
“The bargaining team hoped to secure retroactive funding for everyone,” officials wrote on the union website, “but we ultimately reached a point where the state was unwilling to move.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-02 18:57:04.196966

Keith Brooks (left) and Education Secretary Jacob Oliva present the LEARNS Act to the House Education Committee on Feb. 28, 2023. (Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas lawmakers continued to express concern Tuesday about a newly effective law that prohibits students who don’t meet the state’s third-grade reading standard from being promoted to fourth grade. 
The new provision, which goes into effect this fall, is part of the LEARNS Act, a 2023 law that overhauled the state’s K-12 education system. 
The discussion followed Education Sec. Jacob Oliva’s presentation of 2025 state test scores to a joint meeting of the House and Senate education committees Tuesday. Oliva said students that score a Level 1, the lowest level, during the 2026 assessment will be reviewed but not automatically retained because the law allows for “good-cause exemptions.” Oliva told Sen. Stephanie Flowers, D-Pine Bluff, those exemptions could apply to students with disabilities.
Arkansas’ rising 3rd graders will be first to be held back under new literacy standards

The goal of the review, he said, is to have a discussion about students who have “very limited understanding” in third grade. 
“If they were to go on to fourth grade without significant supports, they’re going to continue to struggle,” Oliva said. 
Options can then be considered, he said, such as enrolling in a summer program, offering high-impact tutoring or testing for a learning disability. Education officials would also consider if the student has already been retained or if they’re an English language learner, he said. 
“There’s a lot of factors that go into making that decision,” Oliva said. “It’s not saying that they automatically have to be retained. That may be the best decision for that child, but what it’s saying is that if a student does get promoted at a fourth grade without demonstrating a high level of understanding in literacy, there’s some provisions that also have to be in place.”
Only 35% of students are reading at grade level, according to the Arkansas Department of Education.
Asked by Sen. Frederick Love, D-Mabelvale, how many students scored a Level 1 in 2025, Oliva estimated around 10,000 students would be at risk. However, he noted that estimate includes students like English language learners, who may be exempt from retention. The goal of the new law, he said, is not to retain all of those students.
Arkansas education overhaul rules still a work in progress, officials say

“We do not intend to add student parking at middle school, that is not the goal of third-grade promotion,” Oliva said. “It’s to make sure that we are identifying skills that need support early, intervening, doing our job to mitigate that number as much as we can.”
In response to Flowers questioning whether each individual student would be reviewed, Oliva said he’s not sure if the education department will be at that level this year. Because it’s a new provision, they’re “still trying to figure that out,” he said. 
Oliva also assured Flowers that the rules have been promulgated and the department is “making sure we can clarify that as much as possible” by sharing information through training and webinars.
Rules implementing this new provision were added to the Right to Read Act Rules, which became effective July 1, 2024. ADE Chief of Staff Courtney Salas-Ford told the Advocate in late July that the department was drafting additional information to assist districts with implementation. 
The intent was to add that information to the Right to Read Act Rules, but the department’s legal team was reviewing the information to determine whether a rule revision was necessary, Salas-Ford said.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)WEST COLUMBIA — More than half of South Carolina’s third- through eighth-grade students still can’t do math on grade level, even as reading scores reached all-time highs, according to state standardized testing data released Tuesday.
State Superintendent Ellen Weaver and teachers’ advocates have attributed much of the improvement in reading scores to a shift in how students learn to read. State officials are hoping for similar results in math after launching a training program in the subject this spring.
By 2030, the Department of Education wants three-quarters of all students performing at or above grade level in both subjects. Three districts met that bar in reading: York 4 (Fort Mill), Anderson 4 (Pendleton) and Anderson 1 (Williamston). But none have reached it in math. Fort Mill comes close at 70% proficiency.
The results of SC READY end-of-year tests taken last spring that, overall, 44% of third- through eighth-grade students statewide could do math as expected for their age, while 60% could read on grade level. That’s the highest percentage overall since students began taking SC READY tests 10 years ago, according to department data.
A score of proficient or above indicates a student is ready for the next grade’s work.
“We know that we have challenges in math, and we’re not going to sugarcoat those challenges,” Weaver said.
Improvements in reading
Three years ago, the state began using the LETRS program — short for Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling — to train teachers in phonics, the strategy of sounding out letters and rhyming sounds to teach children how to read. That was a change from “three-cueing,” which teaches children to use context surrounding the word to figure out its meaning.
Every kindergarten through third grade teacher in the state is expected to complete the two-year program by the end of this school year, according to the state education department.
“It’s all part of the big package that has taken a number of years to put together and to align, but now we are beginning to see the dividends of that alignment,” Weaver said during an announcement of the scores at J.C. Lynch Elementary School in Florence 3 (Lake City), which showed big leaps in improvement.
There, the number of students scoring proficient for their grade jumped 10 points to 55% in reading and 13 points to 46% in math.
About half of SC’s 3rd to 8th graders can read on grade level. Math scores are worse.

Reading scores have surpassed those from before the COVID-19 pandemic. This year’s reading scores are the best since students started taking SC READY tests in 2016, according to department data.
In 2021, just 42% of test-takers overall could read on grade level.
“Our reforms are working, and together we will keep pressing toward our 2030 goal, so every child has the opportunity to succeed and thrive,” House Education Chair Shannon Erickson, a Beaufort Republican, said in a statement.
Better reading scores could translate to better scores across the board, said Dena Crews, president of the South Carolina Education Association and an elementary school literacy coach. Reading comprehension skills can help students not just in English class but in cases like parsing out word problems in math, she said.
“Reading is the foundation, really, for everything,” Crews said.
Hopes for improved math scores
Math scores have steadily increased in recent years, but students remain slightly behind where they were in 2019, the last full year of school before the pandemic disrupted learning. All state-standardized testing was suspended in 2020. In 2021, just 37% of students received a score in math showing they were ready for the next grade’s work.
Beginning in January of this year, teachers in 10 of the lowest-performing schools in math started receiving training in best practices. The state also sent math coaches to help students and updated instructional materials, said Abbey Duggins, a state deputy superintendent overseeing academics.
During this fall semester, that will expand to 140 schools, Duggins said. So far, specialized instructors are in about half of those, she said.
“Our goal here in South Carolina is that no kid says, ‘I’m not a math kid,’” Weaver told the state Board of Education during its Tuesday meeting.
Legislators initially spent $10 million on the program, called the Palmetto Math Project, last year. They provided the same amount this year.
Similar to the reading program, which started as a pilot in 2022, the Department of Education will evaluate what works and what doesn’t work in those original districts before expanding the most effective methods statewide, Duggins said.
Math and reading are such different subjects to teach that finding a similar training program to help boost scores has been tricky, Duggins said. The department has settled on OGAP, the Ongoing Assessment Project, which outlines the ways in which students most easily learn different mathematical concepts, Weaver said.
Zearn Math, an online math program with lessons and activities used nationwide, will also expand into South Carolina schools, according to the education department.
The department has also changed the math curriculum to put geometry ahead of algebra, which will introduce students to more concrete ways of learning math before moving into the more abstract realm of algebra, Duggins said.
“If we can just find the way to build in to our teachers’ toolboxes, enhance what they already know about math instruction and take it to the next level, we know that we will start seeing the same results in that math space,” Duggins told the state Board of Education.
What the data says
Older students performed worse than younger ones. Eighth grade students performed the worst in both subjects: 32% of students could do math on grade level, and 56% were reading as expected.
Third graders performed the best. More than 56% of third graders were doing math on grade level, and 62% were reading on level, according to the data.
“That is incredibly concerning to me as a high school teacher, because I know what’s coming for those students when they hit high school,” said Patrick Kelly, a lobbyist for the Palmetto State Teachers Association.
Math skills, especially, tend to build with each class, so a student struggling in one math class is more likely to continue struggling in each of the coming years, Kelly said.
The change in instruction for third graders likely led to the improvement for younger students more than older ones, according to the department. Last year’s third graders were kindergarteners the year teachers began the new training program.
This year, the first kindergarteners whose teachers completed the program entered third grade. Officials are hoping to see scores improve even further as teachers use what they learned in their classrooms, Weaver said.
Fort Mill, which has the state’s lowest poverty rate at 22%, saw the highest reading score in the state, with 82% of students meeting grade level. About 70% of students in the district considered the suburbs of Charlotte, North Carolina, could do math at grade level, according to department data.
The state’s poorest district, McCormick County — where nearly all students live in poverty — saw major gains in its scores. English scores improved by 14%, with 52% on grade level. Math went up nearly 6%, to 26% proficient, according to department data.
That “proves that poverty is not a life sentence — all children have the potential to learn and thrive, and that is exciting,” Senate Education Chair Greg Hembree, a North Myrtle Beach Republican, said in a statement.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4234-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-02 18:57:04.196966

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson announced her candidacy for U.S. Senate Tuesday, hours after U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst publicly announced she would not run for reelection in 2026.
In a statement announcing her run, Hinson aligned herself with President Donald Trump, saying she will be the president’s “strongest ally” in the Senate and will work to support his agenda on issues like immigration and border security, supporting Iowa agriculture and “returning common sense to classrooms.”
“The America First agenda is working for Iowans,” Hinson said. “I’m running for Senate because there’s more work to do, and I am prepared to win and deliver.”
Hinson, currently representing Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District, has been considered a top GOP contender for the U.S. Senate seat amid speculation and reports on Ernst leaving the race. Ernst officially said she would not run for reelection Tuesday, saying it was “no easy decision” to not seek another term but that she planned to focus and “give back” to her family.

In her announcement to run for the spot, the Republican representative thanked Ernst for her military and public service.
“Service defines Senator Joni Ernst — from serving her country in uniform to fiercely fighting for Iowans in the U.S. Senate,” Hinson said. “Her story — from Red Oak to the Senate, is a powerful example of the American dream. Our country and state are better off because of Joni’s selfless service — I lead a heartfelt thank you from every Iowan.”
There are two other Republicans who are also campaigning to become the GOP Senate nominee — former state lawmaker Jim Carlin and Joshua Smith, who previously ran as a Libertarian candidate for the state Senate.
Multiple Republican U.S. Senators, including Katie Britt of Alabama, Jim Banks of Indiana and Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma endorsed Hinson as she entered the race.
“She’s proudly pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, and is working hard to cut the long-unchecked waste, fraud, and abuse that’s run rampant in Washington,” Banks said in a statement. “There is no doubt she is the conservative fighter we need in the Senate to advance President Trump’s agenda and keep America on the right path.”
Hinson has represented northeast Iowa in the U.S. House for three terms since she defeated incumbent U.S. Rep. Abby Finkenauer, a Democrat, in the 2020 election. Before her time in Congress, Hinson worked as a TV news anchor for Cedar Rapids’ KCRG, in addition to serving in the Iowa House.
Her move to run for Senate means the 2nd Congressional District will be without a Republican incumbent. Multiple Democrats — state Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque,  Clint Twedt-Ball, the founder of the nonprofit Matthew 25 and Kathy Dolter, the former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College — have announced their campaigns, but there are currently no Republicans who have entered the field.
Though the 2nd Congressional District is rated as a “solid Republican” seat by the Cook Political Report heading into 2026, Katie Smith, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said Hinson shifted to the U.S. Senate race as “her re-election prospects are doomed because Northeast Iowans see that she is more focused on serving billionaires than working for them.”
“Hinson knows what we know: there’s change coming in Iowa, Democrats will compete aggressively to flip this seat, and we will win because Iowans are ready to elect someone who actually puts them first,” Smith said.
But House Republicans’ campaign arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee, argued Iowans will elect the eventual GOP nominee in Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District.
“This is simple: Iowa voters trust Republicans to deliver real, commonsense results and have no interest in the Democrats’ radical agenda,” NRCC Spokeswoman Emily Tuttle said in a statement. “This seat will stay red.”
Democrat Bob Krause joins Democratic primary for U.S. Senate
Iowa Democrat Bob Krause has also entered the race for U.S. Senate, ending his campaign for Iowa’s 1st Congressional District.
Krause, the president of the Veterans National Recovery Center and a former state representative, made a video Monday announcing his bid to become the 2026 Democratic nominee for Iowa’s U.S. Senate seat. He is joining a crowded primary field — state Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs, Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris and former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Director Nathan Sage have also announced their campaigns for the position.
But Krause said he was the best candidate for the job because of his background in the state legislature, his work as a regional representative for the U.S. Secretary of Transportation in former President Jimmy Carter’s administration and his military experience.
“For 28 and a half years in the military, I pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States from all enemies, foreign and domestic,” Krause said in the video. “Today I see movements towards the ignoring of the Constitution, and I want to change that.”
Krause has run for Senate multiple times before — he sought to become the Democratic nominee in 2010, 2016 and 2022 — though he withdrew from the Democratic primary in 2022 after failing to gather enough signatures to make it onto the ballot. Krause said in a statement he is coming into the race with a “robust network of supporters across the state” from previous election cycles.
In May, Krause announced he was running for Iowa’s 1st Congressional District, currently represented by U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks. In a statement Monday, Krause said he was withdrawing from this race and endorsing Democrat Christina Bohannan for the Democratic nomination.
Bohannan, a former Iowa House member and University of Iowa law professor, was the 1st District Democratic nominee in 2024, a race she lost to Miller-Meeks with 47% of the vote to the incumbent’s 53% after requesting a vote recount. She announced she would run for the position again in June. Krause said in a statement Bohannan has “run before, possesses a strong work ethic and enjoys exceptional name recognition.”
Travis Terrell, a patient access specialist at University of Iowa Health Care, is also running to become the 1st District Democratic nominee, campaigning as a progressive candidate.

(Photo courtesy of Bernalillo County)In an executive order issued last week, President Donald Trump took aim at states and cities that no longer require people to pay bail to stay out of jail while they await trial. 
Specifically, Trump directed his administration to compile a list of any grants and contracts the federal government has with “cashless bail jurisdictions” that could be suspended or terminated. Cashless bail means judges have the option of releasing someone without having to pay bail so long as they are not dangerous or a flight risk.
New Mexico is likely to appear on that list, as it eliminated cash bail nearly a decade ago.
In interviews with Source NM, criminal justice experts said cash bail disproportionately holds poor people and people of color in jail; the vast majority of people released before their trials don’t go on to commit new crimes; and holding people in jail tends to increase crime, not reduce it.
Jonathan Ibarra, a public defender and president of the New Mexico Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, told Source NM Trump’s executive order is an opening salvo in the administration’s efforts to roll back bail reform across the country, one that is “more likely to punish poor people” because under a cash bail system, if a defendant has enough money, they could pay bail no matter how high a judge set it.
“That was a big problem with how bail was set up: it really became about keeping poor people in jail more than it became about keeping dangerous people in jail,” said Ibarra, a former district court judge.
Paul Guerin, deputy director of the Center for Applied Research and Analysis at the University of New Mexico, told Source the data doesn’t support the president’s assertions about bail reform encouraging defendants on pretrial release to commit more crime “because they know our laws will not be enforced.”
“If jurisdictions like Washington D.C., states like New Mexico or other local cities were required to go back to cash bail, we would see an increase in jail populations, people would stay in jail longer and they would not commit new crimes if we would have released them,” Guerin said.
Scott Hechinger, a civil rights attorney, former public defender and founder and executive director of media education nonprofit Zealous, told Source states and cities across the country that have reduced pretrial incarceration, such as New York, have preserved more people’s freedom, saved money by not incarcerating them and experienced no increase in crime as a result.
“What Trump is doing is just the most recent non-fact-based argument against what I would argue is the most successful criminal justice policy in the last half a century,” Hechinger said.
Ibarra said aside from the executive order being bad policy, as a practical matter he doesn’t know how Trump’s executive order could force New Mexico to reverse bail reform because it’s written into the state Constitution.
The state Supreme Court in 2014 ruled that cash bail violated New Mexicans’ constitutional right to pretrial release. Two years later, voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment to eliminate cash bail, while still giving judges the power to deny release to provably high-risk defendants.
Lawmakers and prosecutors in 2022 and 2023 proposed legislation that would have required defendants to prove they aren’t too dangerous for pretrial release. The bill ultimately failed after pushback from public defenders and criminal justice advocates who said, if the bill passed, they would challenge its constitutionality.
The bill’s opponents cited findings from researchers at New Mexico’s court system, the Legislature and UNM showing that most people facing felony charges who were released before their trials did not go on to get arrested for a violent crime.
A similar pattern holds in every jurisdiction in the U.S. that has intentionally reduced pretrial incarceration, Hechinger said.
He points to a 2021 meta-analysis of the connection between incarceration and public safety that found that almost every study over the past two decades had reached the same conclusion. 
Pretrial detention, especially of a poor person, can result in someone losing their home, children, job or vehicle, Ibarra said. Holding more people in jail may make the community slightly less dangerous in the very short term, he said, but in the long term, it means more people coming out of jail without the ability to help themselves and with a higher likelihood to then commit crimes. 
“Do we want their lives to have been completely ruined so they don’t have a choice but to go commit more crimes in order to feed themselves or house themselves?” Ibarra said. “Or do we want people to get out and be able to maintain what they had in order to become or remain contributing members of society?”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MDC-recruitment-video-screenshot-1024x576.png,,,2025-09-02 18:57:04.196966

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s beleaguered secretary of corrections has resigned.
Gov. Larry Rhoden told South Dakota Searchlight that Kellie Wasko delivered the letter announcing her Oct. 20 departure on Tuesday, though the letter is dated Sept. 1.
News of the secretary’s resignation after 3½ years on the job came less than a day after a group of 20 lawmakers in the House of Representatives signed a letter calling on Rhoden to “clean up his Department of Corrections” before a Sept. 23 special session. That’s when lawmakers will be asked to endorse construction of a $650 million, 1,500-bed men’s prison in Sioux Falls. 
The timing of the lawmaker letter was coincidental and “unfortunate,” Rhoden said.

“She had made up her mind, and she knew what she wanted to do,” the governor said. “She knew that this wasn’t getting better.”
Rhoden added that only one of the letter’s 20 signatories, Howard Republican Rep. Tim Reisch, had called him to express his concerns about Wasko in the past six months.
“I guarantee you, they all have my cell number,” said Rhoden.
The governor added that he had faith in Wasko in spite of criticisms of her management style and a wave of security incidents and controversies since 2023. 
Despite that confidence, Rhoden said he recognizes that Wasko’s resignation will make it easier to convince the Legislature to back the $650 million project.
“You’re always looking for the hurdles that are going to give people a path to ‘no,’ and to remove those hurdles and give them more reasons to say ‘yes,’” Rhoden said. 
Letter authors laud resignation
Reisch, the first lawmaker to call for Wasko’s resignation and a former corrections secretary himself, lauded the news as a step forward as the Legislature ponders a replacement for the oldest parts of the state penitentiary in Sioux Falls.
“I just hope it’s a transition to a better way of doing things,” Reisch said.
None of the 20 lawmakers listed on the letter hold leadership positions in the House.
But House Speaker Jon Hansen, the Dell Rapids Republican now running for governor, said Wasko “needs to be fired” on his campaign’s Facebook page Tuesday morning.
House Speaker Pro Tempore Karla Lems, R-Canton, is Hansen’s gubernatorial running mate. She said she wasn’t asked to sign the letter. Even so, she said Wasko’s leadership is “what I think rises to the top” of her list of concerns about an expensive new prison.
Resignation letter lists accomplishments 
Wasko, a nurse by training who spent years working in Colorado’s correctional system before coming to South Dakota in 2022 as an appointee of then-Gov. Kristi Noem, wrote that she’d spent the past few months discussing her decision with her family.
She’s leaving “to pursue other opportunities,” the letter says.
Tumultuous period at penitentiary culminates in warden’s departure

The two-page document has four paragraphs in total, reserving the bulk of its space for 22 bullet points listing “just a handful” of her accomplishments.
Among them are a 43% increase in correctional officer pay and a decrease in staff vacancies, creating a “comprehensive reentry program”  for inmates leaving state prisons, curing 300 inmates of Hepatitis C, creating an Office of Inspector General to investigate crime behind the walls and a reduction in escapes.
“I have worked diligently for the last 3½ years to improve the Department of Corrections and I know I am leaving it far better than I found it,” the letter says.
It also points to a change in the DOC’s “insolence” and discipline policy, which was “highly controversial” with previous secretaries and ended the practice of placing inmates in disciplinary segregation for talking back to officers.
“It was necessary, and we have successfully corrected the process,” she wrote, noting that a 2022 operations review recommended housing inmates in “the least restrictive environment necessary to maintain safe and secure facilities.”
Critics: New policies made for unsafe facilities
The letter from lawmakers stopped short of demanding Wasko’s resignation – it doesn’t mention her by name – but Reisch said changes like that are why he’s called for her ouster. 
“If inmates know what the rules are and that they’re enforced, the vast majority will comply with them,” Reisch said. “If word gets around that they’re not enforced, that word gets around pretty fast, and security goes by the wayside.”
Reisch said staff assaults are up, based on conversations he’s had with current correctional officers. The DOC’s annual statistical report for 2024 showed assaults on staff at a five-year low, but Reisch said that could be a matter of shifting definitions of assault since Wasko came to lead the agency in 2022. 
“A lot of the definitions can change,” said Reisch, who also suggested that some assaults aren’t logged.
Attorney General Marty Jackley told the Dakota Town Hall podcast in mid-February that his office had more than 100 open assault investigations involving inmates. 










You’re always looking for the hurdles that are going to give people a path to ‘no,’ and to remove those hurdles and give them more reasons to say ‘yes.’


– Gov. Larry Rhoden, about the Wasko resignation's potential impact on legislative support for a prison construction project


Corrections spokesman Michael Winder declined to offer the number of staff assaults to occur thus far in 2025, and said the definition of “assault” has not changed since 2022.
Not all lawmakers saw Wasko’s leadership as a sticking point. Sen. Majority Leader Jim Mehlhaff, R-Pierre, scolded the House members for the letter in a Tuesday interview with South Dakota Searchlight, arguing that it was improper to “inject other issues” into a discussion about replacing a prison he called “inhumane” and “a lawsuit waiting to happen.”
Mehlhaff, who served on the Project Prison Reset task force, said Wasko “has been treated more unfairly than any public official in the state,” noting that she came to the job after a scandal resulting in the removal of top DOC officials under accusations of misconduct and nepotism.
“She did not come on to a DOC that was a well-oiled machine,” Mehlhaff said. “It was a disaster.”
Money questions
Each of the House members who signed the letter voted in February for a bill to finalize funding for what would have been an $825 million, 1,500-bed men’s prison in southern Lincoln County.
That effort ultimately failed. In the wake of that failure, Rhoden established a Project Prison Reset task force to build consensus on the need, price and placement of a new facility to ease overcrowding at the state penitentiary in Sioux Falls.
The group voted to back a 1,500-bed facility on undeveloped land in northeastern Sioux Falls, and to cap the price at $650 million.
Governor announces $17 million deal for Sioux Falls prison site, subject to legislative approval

The $175 million distance between the first figure and the second was also cited as a concern in the letter. 
Rhoden released a Frequently Asked Questions webpage last week on the prison that claims the prison’s designers were able to hit that budgetary mark, in spite of those designers telling the task force it was “a tall order” at the group’s final meeting in July.
Mortenson recalls being told in February that the state’s $825 million proposal was the lowest number possible for a 1,500-bed prison. On the House floor, Mortenson was among the lawmakers to repeat the DOC’s assertion that delay would inevitably increase the prison’s price.
“The same people in the administration were telling us they’d already found all the cost savings they could six months ago, and we believed them,” Mortenson said. “Now it’s a much different story.”
Rhoden: There are answers
The governor said Tuesday that there are “quantifiable answers” to the lawmakers’ questions. On the cost savings, he said the new design trims the number of buildings from seven to five, and consolidates common areas for inmates.
“We save 150,000 square feet right there,” Rhoden said.  
That figure is not on the prison FAQ page, however. On the price drop, the page says “contractors and designers are preparing a specific plan to meet this budget, and more detail will be added when it is available, in early September.”
Rhoden said he intends to hold conference calls with lawmakers in the coming days and weeks to answer their questions in advance of the special session.
“I would really like to see this evolve into a type of deal where it’s almost a formality to vote, that everybody is informed and comfortable enough that they can just go in, have their discussion and vote up or down,” he said.

Assistant House Minority Leader Marty Overweg, R-New Holland, said there’s a decent chance that lawmakers will be won over – if their questions are answered. Overweg still wants to know why Nebraska is building a prison for millions less than South Dakota, for example, and said the governor’s office has yet to satisfy his curiosity. 
The FAQ page says South Dakota’s prison “will be designed and built to last 100 years, with durable materials, modern security, and full programming spaces – unlike other states that cut corners upfront, only to face higher costs later.”
Overweg, echoing a refrain from lawmakers like Reps. Lems and Hansen, sees value in putting the project out for bids again to make sure. 
“I don’t think there’s any urgency,” he said. “I think the special session is crazy. There’s no reason we couldn’t do this first thing at the start of the next session” in January.
He also wants assurances that the price lawmakers vote on is the price that will stick. The new women’s prison in Rapid City, currently under construction, came in at a final price of $87 million. Initially, Overweg said, it was pitched at a cost a lot closer to $30 million.

Article Summary

Gov. JB Pritzker said he expects ICE’s work in Chicago to look similar to recent federal action in Los Angeles. ICE operations are expected to begin later this week.
In an Oval Office news conference just before Pritzker spoke, President Donald Trump said ‘we’re going in’ when asked about sending the National Guard to Chicago. Pritzker argued Trump is waiting for a skirmish between law enforcement and protesters to justify the deployment.
Also on Tuesday, a federal judge in California ruled Trump had no legal basis to deploy troops to L.A.
Pritzker said information gathered from sources indicates Mexican Independence Day celebrations could be ICE’s target.
Trump cited Chicago’s violent Labor Day weekend as evidence the city needs National Guard intervention.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

Gov. JB Pritzker said Tuesday he expects Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to employ the same aggressive strategies they used in Los Angeles earlier this summer after President Donald Trump said he will deploy the National Guard to Chicago.
The information, Pritzker said, was not directly communicated to him, but rather gleaned from anonymous sources in the federal government, military and “well-sourced” news reports.  He said he’s been told members of the Texas National Guard are being readied for deployment to Chicago and many of the same federal ICE and Homeland Security groups that worked in L.A. are being relocated to Chicago.
Pritzker said Illinois State Police received a call from Customs and Border Protection Chief Gregory Bovino over the weekend confirming that ICE will ramp up immigration enforcement in Chicago at some point this week. But the call, Pritzker said, was more rhetorical than informational.
Bovino, who was recently described in a New York Times article as “the face” of Trump’s immigration policies, led immigration operations in L.A. which included aggressive and sometimes controversial tactics leading to claims of racial profiling, according to the Times.
“Any rational person who has spent even the most minimal amount of time studying human history has to ask themselves on one important question: Once they get the citizens of this nation comfortable with the current atrocities committed under the color of law, what comes next?” Pritzker said.
To what extent the effort will be aided by the National Guard is unclear. But just minutes before Pritzker took questions, Trump removed any doubt that he’d like to deploy the National Guard – even as a federal judge in California ruled Tuesday that his Guard deployment in that city was illegal.
“We’re going in. I didn’t say when we’re going in,” Trump said from the Oval Office, repeating that he wants Pritzker to call him and ask for help.
Naval Station Great Lakes in North Chicago will be the staging grounds for ICE, the Sun-Times reported. Pritzker said staging began at the base Monday.
The governor also said he believes the Trump administration planned to come to Chicago in September to target Mexican Independence Day celebrations.
“Let’s be clear: the terror and cruelty is the point, not the safety of anyone living here,” he said.
Chicago has one of the largest Latino populations in the nation, and 74% of that group are of Mexican heritage, according to a study last year by the University of Illinois Chicago. The city’s Mexican Independence Day parade is schedule for Sept. 14.
Pritzker encouraged residents to learn their rights and film ICE’s work.
“Authoritarians thrive on your silence,” he said. “Be loud for America.”
Pritzker also warned protesters to remain peaceful and said Trump plans to use skirmishes with ICE to justify sending the National Guard.
“If someone flings a sandwich at an ICE agent, Trump will try and go on TV and declare an emergency in Chicago,” he said. “I’m imploring everyone, if and when that happens, do not take the bait.”

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said he plans to take legal action if federal officials take unconstitutional actions, including in law enforcement duties.
“President Trump has been utilizing the notion that he and he alone can deal with crime in American cities, and his preferred tool in doing so is the American military,” Raoul said. “The problem with this approach is that it’s both bad strategy and illegal.”
L.A. deployment illegal, judge rules
A federal judge in California ruled Tuesday morning that Trump’s troop deployment to Los Angeles in June to fight crime violated an 1878 law prohibiting the military from carrying out domestic law enforcement. The judge wrote there is ample evidence to suggest Trump plans to continue violating the law, citing the president’s statements about Chicago.
Trump activated thousands of members of the National Guard without California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s permission to manage protests against aggressive immigration raids in the city. The judge ruled there was no evidence of rebellion or that local law enforcement was unable to manage the protests themselves.
The ruling provides Illinois with a legal precedent to lean on should Trump again try to deploy the National Guard in Chicago under the guise of managing protests and protecting ICE officials.
“I would love to do it now,” Trump said of Chicago. “We’re going to do it anyway. We have the right to do it because I have an obligation to protect this country.”
Raoul said no situations that would allow the president to deploy the National Guard in Chicago exists.
“The militia clauses of the United States Constitution give Congress sole authority to decide the circumstances that allow the president to federalize the National Guard,” Raoul said. “The 10th Amendment preserves states’ sovereignty to enforce state laws as they see fit.”
Labor Day weekend violence
Labor Day weekend was violent in Chicago. Fifty-eight people were shot and eight were killed in incidents across the city, which included three mass shootings.
The violence marked an uptick from last year’s Labor Day weekend when 22 people were shot and eight were killed.
Trump inflated where Chicago ranks on crime compared to other cities in his remarks Tuesday, comparing it to Afghanistan and again calling it a “hell hole.”
“The president’s absurd characterizations do not match what is happening on the ground here,” Pritzker said. “He has no idea what he’s talking about. There is no emergency that warrants deployment of troops.”
Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson blamed Trump for the city’s gun violence problems because Trump’s administration has withheld federal funding for violence prevention from the city. He added he welcomes more partnerships with federal law enforcement agencies.
Violent crime is down in Chicago this year, however. Chicago Police Department data through Aug. 24 shows crime is down 13% overall compared to 2024, including murders down 32%. Crime remains up 40% from 2021, however.

The crops continue to develop, with 63% of corn acres across the state now dented and 19% of soybeans coloring, for the reporting period of Aug. 25 through Aug. 31. 
Corn condition was rated at 84% good to excellent, the same as last week, while soybean condition at 77% good to excellent declined slightly from the week prior.

The report, written by U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, reported that the oat harvest in Iowa was “virtually complete” and farmers were nearly complete with their third cutting of alfalfa hay, with just 13% remaining. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said farmers will be busy this month bailing hay, chopping silage and “beginning to gear up for harvest.”
“Now is also a great time to plan for seeding cover crops and adding other conservation practices to fields after harvest,” Naig said in a statement. 
Naig also noted the cool, dry conditions across the state that led to a “gorgeous holiday weekend.” 
According to State Climatologist Justin Glisan, the state average temperature for the reporting period was 65 degrees Fahrenheit, which was more than 6 degrees below normal temperatures for the period. 
Several areas reported temperatures as low as 40 degrees during the period. 
While some eastern areas of the state had a couple inches of rain, the state average for the week was less than two-tenths of an inch, while the normal is 0.88 inch. 
Despite the less-than-an-inch of rain the past several reporting periods, soil moisture conditions remain adequate to surplus. Across the state, topsoil moisture conditions were 78% adequate and 12% surplus. Subsoil moisture conditions were similar with 79% adequate and 13% surplus. 
Soil conditions were driest in the southwest and southeast regions of the state. In those regions, around 30% of topsoil moisture was short, according to the report. 
According to the seven-day precipitation forecast from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the majority of the state is forecast to receive less than half an inch of rain this week.

Landers,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/harvard-along-with-every-organization-in-trumps-cross-hairs-needs-to-embrace-being-uncomfortable/,"
The Trump administration’s intrusive and illegal actions demand leaving the realm of comfort, taking risks, and enduring for as long as it takes and as uncomfortable as it becomes to preserve the principles of academic independence. 
The post Harvard — along with every organization in Trump’s cross hairs — needs to embrace being uncomfortable  appeared firs[...]","THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S attacks on Harvard University contort the government’s regulatory power to exert ideological control over higher education. Harvard is a prime target because of its prominence and its wealth. Even though continuing to fight entails immediate discomfort, Harvard must resist the urge to take refuge in any temporary and illusory settlement. 
Fundamentally, the government’s list of allegations against Harvard and other universities smacks of a recent law school graduate developing a checklist of hypothetical arguments. 
The administration has presented no evidence for most of its claims, and Harvard has taken corrective action on the few that have a modicum of merit. Any organization, however distinguished, can become better. But the idea that a preeminent institution of higher education is so corrupt that the federal government must execute a hostile takeover strains credulity.  
Nonetheless, Harvard is still negotiating in good faith with its arbitrary and capricious antagonists. Striking an agreement would be mistake.  
Whether the Trump administration will honor any such agreement is uncertain. Harvard’s own dealings with the administration indicate that officials generate an ever-escalating set of regulatory threats.  
The accusations of the moment seem to move to the next item on the law graduate’s checklist. Settlement when future claims could be made based on the administration’s vindictive and retaliatory whims does not serve Harvard’s goals: protecting academic freedom and remaining in control over the ability to select students, hire faculty, and teach and conduct research according to recognized standards and values. 
Standing up to this unlawful and extortionist effort to control private institutions is not a comfortable position for Harvard – or any university, law firm, media organization, or corporation also in the Trump administration’s sights. Surprisingly, many of the most privileged and wealthy organizations and people in the country seem unwilling to use their power and to make sacrifices necessary to reject authoritarian control.   
Harvard must embrace discomfort and follow the example of notable movements that overcame government wrongdoing. Official segregation at public universities like the University of Mississippi and University of Georgia ended because people like James Meredith and Charlayne Hunter-Gault pursued their education despite violent threats. The Washington Post and New York Times withstood the retaliatory threats of the Nixon administration to publish the Pentagon Papers, official documents exposing government lies about the conduct of the Vietnam War. Central European University in Budapest relocated to Vienna rather than capitulate to the coercive intrusions of Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán’s regime. And every law firm that has challenged the Trump administration’s sanctions has won in court, refusing to acquiesce in the silencing of advocates for the rule of law.  
Harvard should follow these examples. In this worthy crusade, Harvard can rely on the faith of thousands of alumni, students, and faculty who urge the university to stand its ground. 
Obviously, Harvard cannot relocate to another country to escape government intrusion. To steel its resolve, Harvard leaders need only recall the eternal shame of every institution that failed to desegregate voluntarily.   
During the “Red Scare” of the Cold War era, universities imposed ideological and viewpoint orthodoxy on faculty members, capitulating to federal and state government threats, costing many scholars their careers, and depriving students of valuable diverse perspectives. Universities have been apologizing for this cowardice and failure to defend academic freedom ever since. They should not make the same mistake in responding to the Trump administration’s abuse of federal regulatory power to impose its preferred viewpoints on higher education institutions. 
The harsh impact of lost funding and regulatory constraints on jobs, scholarly pursuits, and student opportunities cannot be discounted. Unlike many institutions, however, Harvard is in a privileged position to mitigate these effects. Of what use is power and prestige earned over the centuries if not deployed in the current circumstances? 
Authoritarian overreach requires a resolute response. Wealthy universities and their donors are accustomed to being comfortable.  
In an 1857 speech, Frederick Douglass said, “The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.” The Trump administration’s intrusive and illegal actions demand leaving the realm of comfort, taking risks, and enduring for as long as it takes and as uncomfortable as it becomes to preserve the principles of academic independence.

An adult and a juvenile pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder charges Tuesday in connection with the Aug. 11 beating in Burlington and subsequent death of a South Burlington resident.
Scott Kastner, 42, was allegedly the victim of a “frenzied mob style assault” by a group of people around 1:30 p.m. on Aug. 11, according to Burlington police. 
The attack began in an alley off Church Street and spilled on to City Hall Park. The victim was “savagely punched and kicked” while he was on the ground, causing a severe brain bleed that prompted emergency intubation and surgery at the University of Vermont Medical Center, according to court documents.

Kastner died five days later from complications due to blunt force trauma to the head, and the medical examiner preliminarily ruled his death a homicide, according to police. 
Originally from Pittsfield, Massachusetts, Kastner leaves behind four children, six siblings and his parents, according to his obituary.
Police arrested one of the suspects on Friday and another on Saturday. At least three other minors have also been charged in relation to the case, police said.
Isaiah Argro, 26, of Queens, New York, and a 16-year-old Colchester resident VTDigger is not naming, were ordered held without bail by Judge Timothy Doherty after arraignments Tuesday morning in Chittenden County Superior criminal court in Burlington. The juvenile was charged as an adult. 
A second-degree murder conviction carries up to a life sentence, with a presumptive minimum term of 20 years, according to the charge sheet filed by the Chittenden County State’s Attorney’s Office.
Argro, who also uses the last name Agro, allegedly punched Kastner in the head approximately 10 times, police wrote in court documents. He is being held at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans.
The teenage defendant allegedly hit Kastner in the head approximately six times and pointed a gun at him, according to court documents. 
The judge further ordered the defendants must not have contact with each other nor with a woman who was a witness, according to court documents. Argro has previous criminal charges in New York, police said.
Amid continued debates about safety downtown, the Burlington City Council last week passed a resolution that includes increasing police presence, among other measures, to help create a safer and more welcoming City Hall Park. It also passed  a companion ordinance for some less serious violations to be processed through a restorative justice system.

Dan McKee joins local legislators and educational leaders to kick off the 2025-26 Attendance Matters RI campaign at the State House Tuesday, Sept. 2, 2025. (Governor's Office photo)More Rhode Island kids attended school in the last school year, pulling the state’s chronic absenteeism rate down to 22.1% — a decrease of around 2.6 percentage points, according to new state data released Tuesday.
The rate of chronic absenteeism — defined as missing at least 18 days of school, or 10% of a school year — was 24.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. 
The 2024-2025 academic year dip comprises about 142,360 fewer absences compared to the 2023-2024 school year. 
“I know that these improved results are happening only because of the hard work of the students, families, educators and administrators like those here today,” Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green said at a Tuesday morning State House press conference to publicize the latest slate of initiatives tied to the ongoing Attendance Matters RI campaign.
School absenteeism rose sharply during the pandemic nationwide. In Rhode Island, chronic absenteeism rates peaked at 34.1% during the 2021-2022 school year. Statewide rates have declined for three consecutive years but have largely remained above pre-COVID 19 benchmarks of under 20%.
The state-controlled Providence Public Schools District (PPSD) saw robust improvement: Chronic absenteeism went down nearly 7 percentage points, from 36.2% to 29.3% for the 2024-2025 school year.
Overall, the state’s biggest school district has improved 27.8 percentage points since the 2021-2022 school year, when PPSD’s chronic absenteeism rate peaked at 57.1%. 
Reversing chronic absenteeism trends has been a major concern of Infante-Green and Gov. Dan McKee, who emphasized Rhode Island’s recent progress while detailing the state’s continued strategies to reduce chronic absenteeism as students return to school statewide.
“We really want families and parents to know that if that child is feeling good, they need to be in school,” McKee said. “We’re going to talk about the evidence that says that if you’re in school, you’re going to do better. It’s common sense, right? If you’re in school, if you show up, you’re going to do better.”
New attendance guidance for the state’s public schools suggests flagging students who miss 10% of classes and are “significantly off-track” in their grades and studies. 
School districts should notify families of such students with a “Promotion in Doubt” letter by the end of the first quarter of the school year, and provide quarterly updates after the initial letter if necessary. Schools are advised to exhaust resources like Individualized Learning Plans, tutoring, transportation assistance and social services before deciding to hold a student back.
The commissioner noted that chronically absent students have a four-year high school graduation rate of just 58.9%, compared with 96.2% for their peers — a nearly 38-point gap, Infante-Green noted.
“Every student that we’re able to recover makes a difference in their lives and the lives of the state,” Infante-Green said, adding that some of the most effective interventions have been some of the simplest.
“Last year, we sent magnetic refrigerator calendars home with every single student in the state,” the commissioner said. “It was just a little thing that we tried, but students loved it. They were a physical representation of the hard work our students were doing by showing up to school every single day.”
Infante-Green said that families have been inquiring about the calendars’ return this year, and she added that the calendars will once again be available this year to “every single household in Rhode Island.” 
Also premiering this year is an attendance heat map which shows in real-time when absences spike at the school, district, and state level. Absenteeism rates tend to cluster around weekends and holiday breaks — an anecdotal argument the state now has data to back up, Infante-Green said.
Complete attendance and absenteeism data for the 2024-2025 school year is available on RIDE’s website.

The project began in a handful of towns and has grown to serve grade-schoolers and their families in a dozen communities across the White River Valley.

This story, by Maryellen Apelquist, was first published in the White River Valley Herald on August 28. 
In the 1990s, Frank Lamson, a newly credentialed pediatric nurse practitioner fresh off a stint at an urban school clinic in Massachusetts, came home to South Royalton with an idea: that such a clinic “would really be a good thing to have in a rural community.”
He shared that thought with friend and pediatrician Becky Foulk, who just a few years before had opened a private medical practice in town, and with whom Lamson worked. The doctor agreed, and it wasn’t long before the duo teamed with others, including local school nurses, to open HealthHUB, Vermont’s first school-based clinic.
Since then, 1995, the nonprofit clinic, funded with a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant channeled through the state Agency of Human Services, has operated in collaboration with the South Royalton Health Center to provide in-school medical care, mental health counseling, and a mobile dental program that expanded in 2009. What began as care for students in a handful of towns, South Royalton, Sharon, Tunbridge and Strafford, has grown to serve grade-schoolers and their families in a dozen communities across the White River Valley, from Brookfield to Stockbridge.
While all of HealthHUB’s services are in demand — the organization’s leaders report wait lists in some areas, including mental health care — the dental program is perhaps most widely recognized. Last school year, the dental clinic alone had about 400 patient visits.
Its signature silver-gray trailer with a large, smiling tooth on the side, outfitted as a dental office, can be spotted parked throughout the region, from the employee lot at Gifford Medical Center during the summer months to schools throughout the valley.
The hub’s first such trailer, purchased with a $95,000 grant awarded with the support of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., recently reached the end of its useful life as a clinic. It’s now parked in the lot of the town office in Royalton and used for storage.
Its successor, another silver gray unit, has been making the rounds, and Lamson eagerly reported that it is now joined by another vehicle in the HealthHUB fleet, a big rig named “Rosie.”
Tuesday, just one day before the start of school in the White River Valley, the nurse practitioner showed off 42-foot-long Rosie, a shiny motor home named for iconic Rosie the Riveter and built out with an interior to accommodate a comprehensive dental program.
Inside, HealthHUB, which has expanded in the last few years to also provide dental care to adults when school is not in session, provides a long list of services ranging from cleanings and exams to extractions, fillings, crowns, dentures and more.
Lamson himself flew to West Virginia to get Rosie, and drove the rig home to Vermont last fall. It cost $125,000 and came fully equipped with two dental chairs and all necessary office equipment, including a panoramic X-ray system.
“We had purchased that from the health department in Morgantown, [W.Va.],” Lamson said, explaining the branding wrapped around the vehicle that will be soon switched out to HealthHUB’s. “They got a big infrastructure grant from the feds to buy a brand-new one, but they had been using this as a mobile dental office for several years and wanted to sell it. And we were in the right position to acquire it.”
HealthHUB employs a fulltime dentist, dental hygienist, and dental assistant, and Foulk and Lamson are seeking another hygienist and others to join their health care team.
Hiring the full-time dentist, Colleen Anderson, two years ago, “was just a monumental step,” said Foulk.
“When she came onboard, we had been doing a little bit of work for adults with cleanings and stuff in after-school hours and during school vacations and over the summer, you know, that kind of thing. But we really expanded our dental services to offer full-service dentistry. And so we have quite a few adult patients now because there are a lot of adults who also receive benefits either under Medicaid or Medicare, or just are limited in their ability to travel places who utilize our services.”
Thirty years on, Lamson and Foulk’s vision—to provide access to health care services for children and their communities, where they are—remains as simple as it began.
“One of my mantras in establishing this thing has been to keep students in school and their parents at work,” Lamson said, “where kids at school could actually have medical care.”
For Foulk, the key to HealthHUB’s endurance has been its partnerships.
“That’s what this organization has been all about, building partnerships with other organizations to keep it going. So now we’re serving 12 different towns in eight locations,” Foulk said. “For instance, when we go to Randolph, we see kids from Brookfield and Braintree as well. They get bused in. It’s really grown.”
Community partners include Gifford Health Care, Chelsea Health Center, the town of Royalton and the region’s three school districts.
White River Valley nurse Susan Schuhmann, who’s worked at the school for 15 years, has long admired HealthHUB.
“It’s a great service for the community. The child doesn’t need to be pulled out of school early, missing schooltime to go to a doctor’s appointment. It can happen right here, then they’re back to class. And it does help parents who are working or who have transportation issues.”
While there is no celebration planned for HealthHUB’s 30th, Foulk said they could always use additional support, particularly with the uncertainty at the federal level concerning cuts to programs like Medicaid.
“We are trying to plan. It’s hard to know. And it’s hard to know how much the state of Vermont is going to step up and fill in the gaps, how much the state of Vermont will even be able to do that. So it’s hard to plan, but we’re trying to.”
Foulk noted efforts to increase fundraising in the communities served by HealthHUB, including by going, starting in 2026, to each of the annual town meetings “and making requests from every town that we serve, which we haven’t done in the past.”
HealthHUB accepts Vermont Medicaid and is an in-network Northeast Delta Dental provider. Foulk also noted that the team doesn’t “turn anyone away.”
“If somebody can’t pay, they don’t pay. And if they can just pay a little bit, there’s a sliding scale.”
Appointments with HealthHUB Dental Services may be made by calling 802-888-3384.

Stuart Hurd — a career civil servant who worked as the Bennington town manager since 1992 and a total of 52 years for the municipality — died Saturday at age 77 from a long-term illness, the Bennington Banner reported. 
Sharyn Brush, who previously served on the selectboard, zoning board and as a town health officer, said Hurd served in many roles in town government and on local boards. She said “his door was always open” to talk to Bennington community members. 
“He wore many hats, and he wore them all well,” Brush said. “He solved problems well. He looked after the town. He was conscious of the budgets, and he really, really loved Bennington.”
State Rep. Mary Morrissey, R-Bennington, said Hurd “went right up the ranks,” serving the town for around 20 years before taking on the role of town manager in the early ’90s. 
“Stuart was highly respected around the state by fellow town managers and heads of communities as well,” Morrissey said. “That says volumes as to who the man was.”
Assistant Town Manager Dan Monks assumed the town manager’s duties when Hurd took extended medical leave on July 8, according to the Bennington Banner.
Town officials declined to comment on Hurd’s life and legacy Tuesday in accordance with family wishes.

Michelle Lujan Grisham; Joe Altepeter, a DARPA program manager and quantum researcher; Economic Development Secretary Rob Black; and New Mexico Rep. Meredith Dixon (D-Albuquerque) announced further investments in advanced quantum computing. Lujan Grisham told Source NM the sling was due to a recent rotator cuff surgery. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico leaders said a federal partnership announced Tuesday will help launch the state as the “next Silicon Valley” in the frontier of quantum computing, a nascent technology that boosters say will revolutionize problem solving from cancer research to code-breaking.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced a $120 million dollar partnership with Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency — the research and development wing of the U.S. military — will ensure companies can deliver on their proofs of concept for advanced computing. The state and DARPA may contribute up to $60 million dollars each over four years to vet projects promising advanced computers. If companies can prove their prototypes work at a utility-scale, DARPA will award up to $300 million in development.
The partnership, called the Quantum Frontier Initiative, will push development, testing and validate emerging technologies, she said.
Lujan Grisham said she wanted New Mexico to be known as the “home of quantum computing,” during an announcement Tuesday in Roadrunner Venture studio, as Albuquerque hosts 1,500 researchers for a national Quantum Week conference.
After the announcement, Lujan Grisham told Source NM the state was looking to build the ecosystem for quantum to thrive, noting that DARPA’s certification program would attract companies from across the U.S.
“When companies come here to do a proof of concept, then my job is to keep them here,” Lujan Grisham said. “It creates a migration of companies, and that’s what Silicon Valley did.”
The promise of quantum computing would mean the power to perform calculations beyond a traditional computer’s abilities. Even with recent developments in quantum computers, they remain expensive to build, error-prone and fragile to interference, since information is encoded into supercold atoms or in extremely small circuits. If realized, quantum computing poses risks to the encryption that governments and companies use to protect sensitive information.
The State of New Mexico has made a series of investments totaling tens of millions of dollars in quantum computing in recent years.
In April, Lujan Grisham signed a bill to set up the Technology Innovation Division inside the state’s Economic Development Department with $40 million to seek private or federal investments in emerging technologies. New Mexico is also a finalist for $160 million over 10 years from the National Science Foundation to develop quantum technologies for both civilian and military uses. Last week, the state gave Roadrunner Ventures a $25 million grant to develop a downtown hub to build an “Innovation District” focused on quantum computing.
Officials said the state gets a boost from the development of projects at the state’s two national laboratories in Los Alamos and Albuquerque and the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air Force Base.
“We bring the capacity of our national laboratories adding to those workforces, adding to that with our universities, tying that in with [Central New Mexico Community College] creating a quantum boot camp,” Economic Development Secretary Rob Black said. “We are building the workforce.”
DARPA, which has invested in research and development projects for everything from synthetic blood to manta ray-shaped submarines, will provide $60 million to researchers to stress-test quantum computer proposals, said Joe Altepeter, a program manager for Quantum Benchmarking Initiative .
Altepeter got his start in quantum research at Los Alamos National Laboratory as a graduate student in 1999. He described himself previously as a “skeptic,” but said recent developments in the technology raise the question if it’s possible to develop a working quantum computer by 2033. He said the certification program aims to separate working proposals from hype.
“It is an extraordinarily difficult job to figure out to forecast, maybe 10 years in the future, whose phenomenal plan, which is great on paper, is really gonna work…really deliver or transformative change and which ones aren’t,” Altpeter said.
The validation process is a series of three phases to try and determine if quantum companies can develop a computer valuable enough to be worth the cost. DARPA will not necessarily keep an office in the state, but researchers and contractors evaluating the projects will frequently visit Albuquerque or live in-state.
Developing quantum will benefit the whole state, “not just Albuquerque or just scientists,” by increasing the tax base and diversifying the state’s economy, Nora Meyers Sackett, the director at the NM Technology and Innovation Office, told Source NM.
“Quantum is the next revolution of technology, and we’re working to make that revolution happen right here in New Mexico,” she said.

A group of leaders across state government are facing the logistical complexities of planning for employees to work in person three days per week starting in December.

In just three months, state employees will be required to work in person three days a week, a major shift for many in the state’s 8,000-plus workforce.
This week, a team of top officials across Vermont agencies have started to think through the logistics of that transition.
The state’s plan has materialized quickly. In early August, Gov. Phil Scott first mentioned his intention to bring employees back to their offices on a more regular basis. Last week, Administration Secretary Sarah Clark announced the broad sketches of that proposal in a message to all state employees. 
The Vermont State Employees’ Association, the union representing state workers, has strongly opposed the plan. State data indicates that remote flexibility is hugely popular. In a 2024 survey, more than 80% of employees who worked at least partially remotely said it benefited their individual performance, and more than 90% said the arrangement positively benefited their work-life balance.

Amid the looming challenges of the return to office, Douglas Farnham, Vermont’s chief recovery officer and head of a new group of state leaders providing recommendations on the transition, highlighted the goal of the policy shift — a benefit the state risks losing otherwise. 
“When I came to work at the state 14 years ago, I had people that were sitting two, three desks down that had 30 years of experience,” he said in an interview Tuesday. “I could just easily pop questions to them, or if they noticed I was doing something silly, they would let me know. And that isn’t possible in the remote environment.”
While some departments in state government have long required an in-person work approach, thousands of workers have grown accustomed to some amount of telework since the Covid-19 pandemic upended how almost every industry operates. 
Not everyone working for the state will be impacted. Vermont’s constitutional offices, with independently elected leaders, set their own workplace plans. A spokesperson for Attorney General Charity Clark said the office intends to stick with a two-day-per-week in-office schedule that began in 2024. The Treasurer’s Office would also continue a hybrid approach that runs the gamut from completely in-person to fully remote depending on the job, according to a spokesperson for Treasurer Mike Pieciak. 
The cross-agency advisory group Farnham is leading has just begun its work, meaning they have more questions than answers, but they have started by addressing the highest-priority topics raised in both official and unofficial staff feedback. 
“The farther away from the office you live, the more anxiety that causes,” Farnahm said. 
The state’s bargaining agreement with employees requires two weeks’ notice for a cancellation of a telework agreement, and the governor’s plan is providing 90 days, he said. 
It’s likely the state will develop a plan using its existing office footprint, according to state leaders. 
“They fit in the space pre-Covid,” Wanda Minoli, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Buildings and General Services, said. “I don’t see any reason why we would need to be leasing more space.”
Little space remains uninhabitable from the previous summers’ flooding, according to Minoli, though workers have not returned to some Montpelier properties.
In 2023, the state announced its plan to sell its 108 Cherry St. office in Burlington, where more than 400 employees were assigned. A real estate listing for the state property refers to the building as under contract, and a purchase and sale agreement has been signed, but the details aren’t yet public, according to Minoli. The property’s assessed value is more than $29 million.  
Space constraints will be addressed by scheduling, according to Minoli. Employees may not all be in the office on the same day. 
“It’s a recommendation that you could have your own workstation, but that doesn’t mean you need to have it,” she said. 
While the state may have the space for its employees, the home addresses of some of those employees have changed. Though a relatively small group, a growing number of out-of-state employees have joined Vermont’s state government, according to Farnham, another logistical complexity for state leaders to address.

(Juan Salinas II/ Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — After a Republican colleague nixed the idea for a public hearing of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, the lone Democrat who chairs a Nebraska legislative committee has scheduled a hearing for the public to air concerns and get answers about Gov. Jim Pillen’s plan to convert the McCook Work Ethic Camp into a jail for migrants the federal government wants to deport.
The Sept. 12 hearing called by State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha, chair of the Legislature’s Urban Affairs Committee, comes on the heels of the Judiciary chair’s decision not to host a hearing.

State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln last week called it “premature” to hold a hearing sought by 13 progressive lawmakers in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, including McKinney. Many have been critical of the Pillen administration plan, which responds to an amped up Immigration and Customs Enforcement strategy and campaign pledge by President Donald Trump to use states to help accelerate mass deportations.
Last week, Bosn suggested instead that the group direct questions to Pillen and the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office. She said that would be faster and more effective and said the Judiciary Committee had “no more extraordinary authority” than a single or group of lawmakers seeking answers.
 McKinney letter 

Tuesday, McKinney issued a letter of his own saying that due to “potential building code issues” presented by Pillen’s plan, the Urban Affairs committee under Legislative Resolution 148 will offer “a space to discuss such concerns.” The 9 a.m. hearing on Friday, Sept. 12., is open to the public in room 1507 of the Capitol.
McKinney told the Nebraska Examiner he has invited Pillen’s team to the hearing, and expects administration responses will promote “transparency” to Nebraskans. He said he had been considering a hearing before the Urban Affairs Committee before the Judiciary Committee chair opted out.
State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
McKinney’s letter, which he and others publicized on social media and sent to state agencies, the all-male Work Ethic Camp in McCook has 200 beds and an operational capacity of 125. 
A repurposed facility for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement would house about 300 people — an increase in capacity that McKinney’s letter described as “concerning, foremost for safety and security.” It would be state-owned and operated and, state officials have said, the federal government would fully reimburse Nebraska to house federal migrant detainees there. 
McKinney’s letter says Nebraska law requires state buildings and jails to conform with International Building Code standards, including calculations for maximum occupancy. The Urban Affairs Committee oversees legislation and issues related to state building codes.
The letter said that according to state law, “A correctional system overcrowding emergency shall exist whenever the director certifies that the department’s population is over 140% of operations capacity.” 
McKinney asserts that the 300-bed facility planned by Pillen and ICE would put the facility at 240% of a 125-person operational capacity.
The Pillen administration has indicated that accommodating up to 300 detainees would mean repurposing existing spaces previously used for meetings and other programming. The 186 people Nebraska housed at the McCook facility as of Aug. 19 are to be moved to other prisons over the next two months, with specifics still being ironed out.

 Prison overcrowding

Legislatively approved in April 1997, the McCook Work Ethic Camp opened in April 2001 as an effort to reduce prison crowding, primarily by offering rehabilitative programming to low-risk offenders. As a result, the facility hoped to open up space for more violent offenders in other state facilities.
The Work Ethic Camp has most recently served adult men convicted of felonies who need substance use treatment or cognitive restructuring. It had an annual state budget of $9.5 million last year and about 85 staff.
Tuesday, Omaha retiree Paul Feilmann stood with a huge sign outside the Governor’s Residence to protest the detention facility. “I’m trying to keep the issue out there,” the former delivery van driver said, and plans to return every week day from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. for three weeks. His record stay on such vigils, he noted, is four months in 2019 objecting to lack of criminal justice reform.
Mostly alone Tuesday, Feilmann talks to passersby about the issue and makes calls to strategize with others that have the same goal: to get Pillen to change direction.
“It’s dehumanizing and historically raises a whole bunch of nasty inhuman issues,” he said, calling the ICE facility a “bridge too far.”
In the earlier Aug. 27 letter to Bosn — on the letterhead of State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha — the 13 senators posed multiple questions. They noted that the Judiciary Committee chaired by that Bosn has jurisdiction over matters relating to the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services.

Hunt’s letter said Pillen did not seek input from the Legislature on the repurposed detention facility the Trump administration nicknamed the “Cornhusker Clink.” Hunt called that problematic, as the Legislature is “the people’s branch … a co-equal and independent branch of government.”
 Legality issues 

Among questions the lawmakers had was about the legality of Pillen entering a federal agreement to convert a state-run, legislatively defined prison into a federal immigration detention facility, and the legality of Correctional Services facilities and staff being used to house ICE detainees.
The Nebraska Constitution’s Article IV, Section 19, has since 1875 given the Legislature exclusive authority in the “general management, control and government of all state charitable, mental, reformatory and penal institutions.”
The Legislature this spring completed a nearly two-year effort to clarify and strengthen its legislative oversight of executive branch agencies, including the state prison system.

Commenting previously on the Hunt letter, Laura Strimple, a Pillen spokesperson, said lawmakers had not posed their questions to the Governor’s Office. She said lawmakers who want answers are welcome to ask.
“The governor has always been transparent and would be more than happy to answer questions,” Strimple said. “However, the administration cannot answer questions when they are not asked. Rather than engaging in political theater, these Democrat senators should simply send these questions to be answered.”

He has since been elected to the position three times. 
Nevada’s 12-year limit on the terms of most elected officials do not apply to county administrative offices such as clerk, sheriff, and district attorney. 
“These are tough times, and now more than ever, experience matters,” Wolfson said in a video announcing his reelection campaign. 
Wolfson raised $1.6 million in 2022 for his last reelection bid and had $475,000 on hand after handily defeating Republican Timothy Treffinger.
A registered Democrat, Wolfson contributed $2,500 of his campaign windfall to Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo; $1,000 to Republican Assemblywoman Heidi Kasama; and $1,000 and $1,500 respectively to Republican state Senate candidates Lori Rogich and John Steinbeck, whose elections were integral to Lombardo’s successful effort to block a veto-proof Democratic majority in the Senate. 
Wolfson made smaller contributions to Democratic legislative candidates Cameron Miller, Marlene Drake, and Ryan Hampton.   
He also contributed $10,000 to his daughter Rebecca’s campaign for Las Vegas Municipal Judge.  
Wolfson’s campaign news release touts his creation in 2016 of the Conviction Integrity Unit to review questionable cases. The next year, he signed off on the exoneration of DeMarlo Berry, who served 22 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. 
At the time, Wolfson said he created the unit “to provide a way for certain cases to be reviewed independently and evaluated on a variety of factors, including new evidence.”   
But new evidence failed to win over Wolfson in the case of Fred Steese, who Wolfson forced to plead guilty to second degree murder to avoid a lawsuit against the state, according to defense attorney Lisa Rasmussen. 
When Judge Elissa Cadish wrote an order finding Steese innocent after evidence revealed he was in Idaho on the day of the murder for which he was convicted, Wolfson threatened to keep Steese in custody for years pending the D.A.’s appeal of Cadish’s order.
“Wolfson said if Steese wanted to get out he had to take an Alford plea and admit to second degree murder,”  Rasmussen says. After 22 years in prison, Steese opted for the Alford plea, a twisted legal maneuver requiring defendants to plead guilty to crimes they didn’t commit.
The move prevented Steese from suing the state for wrongful prosecution and a potential judgment in his favor.  
Wolfson’s campaign also touts his establishment of Clark County’s “first pre-charge diversion program.” The campaign did not immediately respond to requests for explanation. 
In his 2022 campaign Wolfson touted a post-conviction program to give offenders “the help they need, rather than being sent to prison.” 
Wolfson’s office had no data on the number of participants or their success rate, and a court administrator told the Current that judges were unaware of the program.  
“We do not have any records of the program or information about that program in our database,” wrote Hans Jessup of the state’s Administrative Office of the Court.
In 2018, Wolfson campaigned for a victim rights ballot measure known as Marsy’s Law, which was financed almost entirely by billionaire Henry Nicholas, who at the time faced felony counts of drug trafficking in Clark County.  
The following year, the Current reported that two of the three non-profits sharing a $1 million dollar donation that helped keep Nicholas and his friend, Ashley Fargo out of prison, had ties to the Clark County District Attorney’s office and Nicholas’ defense attorney David Chesnoff.   
Last year, following the arrest of two suspects in the abandonment of Reba, a bulldog who died days after being discarded in a plastic bin, Wolfson bemoaned animal abuse and neglect laws that he said prevented him from seeking stiff sentences. An investigation by the Current revealed Wolfson rarely sought prison time for such offenses.

(Department of Defense Inspector General)Alabama elected officials praised President Donald Trump’s announcement Tuesday that a key military command – which has been operational in Colorado for nearly two years – would be starting over from scratch in Huntsville.
Speaking from the Oval Office and flanked by members of the state’s congressional delegation, the president said U.S. Space Command headquarters would be relocated to Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville from its current home in Colorado Springs, Colo.
“This will result in more than 30,000 Alabama jobs – and probably much more than that – and hundreds of billions of dollars in investment,” Trump said. “Most importantly, this decision will help America defend and dominate the ‘high frontier,’ as they call it.”

Other estimates, including figures presented at the same Oval Office announcement by Alabama’s congressional delegation, put the number of jobs at about a tenth of Trump’s claim: 1,600 direct and 3,000 induced positions.
“This move will save the taxpayers $480 million,” said U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Alabama, citing a figure the Air Force put forward in its initial selection of Redstone Arsenal as the preferred headquarters location. “We look forward to building a huge Space Command and having the Donald J. Trump Space Command Center in Huntsville.”
Established in 2019, U.S. Space Command is responsible for planning and executing global space operations for the U.S. military and other Defense agencies. Those operations include satellite communications, offensive and defensive space control capabilities, and defense of the national security space architecture.
“The Redstone Arsenal region was ready to welcome Space Command Headquarters when I made the official pitch to the Defense secretary in June 2019, and it remains ready today to not only welcome Headquarters, but to welcome all of the military personnel and their families,” Gov. Kay Ivey said in a statement.

Political fallout

Trump’s announcement is the latest move in a six-year-long tug-of-war between Alabama and Colorado over the permanent home for the military’s newest combat command. Along the way, presidents and elected officials of both parties have asserted they were motivated only by national security while accusing their opponents of playing partisan politics.
“What we’ve seen through this process is the worst of Washington – we’ve seen politics get in the way of what is best for the warfighter, what’s best for national security,” U.S. Sen. Katie Britt, R-Alabama,  said Tuesday. “The state of Alabama is about to show the country the best.”
Yet Trump himself noted that reasons beyond national security and preparedness motivated his decision.
Trump to move Space Command headquarters out of Colorado

“The problem I have with Colorado – one of the big problems – they do mail-in voting … so they automatically have crooked elections,” he said. “That played a big factor.”
Tuesday’s announcement follows multiple reviews – by the Government Accountability Office and the Pentagon’s Office of Inspector General, as well as the U.S. Air Force itself – of the selection process that led to the choice of Redstone Arsenal for a permanent headquarters for Space Command.
Alabama’s elected officials have consistently pointed to aspects of the initial selection process and the subsequent reviews that favored Huntsville.
“Alabama was chosen in 2021 because it was the absolute best location for the Space Command headquarters,” said U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Saks, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. “Today, in 2025, it remains the best location for our national security and for the taxpayer.”
Yet parts of the GAO and OIG reports have called into question some of the points in Alabama’s favor. In addition, Space Command has been operational in Colorado Springs since December 2023, which Colorado’s politicians have stressed in calling for the headquarters to remain there.
Even before Trump’s announcement, Colorado vowed a court challenge against any move to relocate the command.
“Moving Space Command Headquarters to Alabama is not only wrong for our national defense, but it’s harmful to hundreds of Space Command personnel and their families,” Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a statement released Tuesday morning. “The Colorado Attorney General’s Office has been preparing in the event the president made such an unlawful decision to move Space Command HQ. If the Trump administration takes this step – I’m prepared to challenge it in court.”
A statement signed by Colorado’s entire congressional delegation – Republicans and Democrats – alleges the move would weaken national security, not strengthen it.
“Moving Space Command sets our space defense apparatus back years, wastes billions of taxpayer dollars, and hands the advantage to the converging threats of China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea,” the statement reads. “The Department of Defense Inspector General’s office has reported multiple times that moving the Command will impede our military’s operational capability for years.”
Decisions and reviews
In May 2019, the U.S. Air Force identified six locations as potential permanent locations for Space Command headquarters, including what was then called Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colo., and Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville. In January 2021, the Air Force announced it had chosen Redstone Arsenal as its preferred location, pending an environmental assessment. That was completed by September 2022, but the Air Force secretary at the time, Frank Kendall, never announced a final decision.
Meanwhile, reviews by two federal watchdog agencies had largely validated that initial selection process.
In May 2022, the Pentagon’s Office of Inspector General concluded that applicable laws and Department of Defense policies were followed, though some supporting documentation was improperly discarded. The following month, the Government Accountability Office reported that while the Air Force largely followed its established basing guidelines, those guidelines did not include independent reviews or well-documented cost analyses, leading to at least the potential for bias.
Then in July 2023, the Pentagon announced that the headquarters would remain at its initial Colorado location – the recently renamed Peterson Space Force Base – per a decision by then-President Joe Biden.
That touched off a firestorm in Alabama’s congressional delegation.
U.S. Rep. Dale Strong, R-Madison, whose 5th Congressional District includes Huntsville and Redstone Arsenal, accused the Biden administration of “ignoring what is best for our nation’s security” in favor of “their woke agenda.” Tuberville said the decision “inserted politics into what had been a fair and objective competition,” while Britt said Biden “irresponsibly” contradicted the Air Force’s preference “in the name of partisan politics.”
In response, Rogers, using his authority as chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, inserted a hold on construction of the Colorado headquarters into the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act, pending additional reviews – again by GAO and the Defense Department’s Inspector General.
Those were made public earlier this year. While each partly reiterated their previous findings, events on the ground in Colorado – including Space Command achieving “full operational capability” nearly two years ahead of schedule – had altered the picture.
Released in April, the Pentagon IG’s report noted that officials with both Redstone Arsenal and Space Command said it would take up to four years for a Huntsville headquarters to achieve comparable levels of readiness to what was in place in Colorado Springs. Moreover, the command expressed concern that “most of the 1,000 civilians, contractors and reservists will not relocate” if a move to Alabama were ordered.
In May, the GAO’s second review called into question the Air Force’s claim that siting the headquarters at Redstone Arsenal would result in cost savings of $480 million – the figure that Tuberville cited Tuesday in the Oval Office.
Auditors, however, noted the cost estimates presented by the service were incomplete and were based on analysis by a consulting firm whose methodology was undocumented.
“Further, the Air Force assigned a confidence level of 5 percent to the cost estimates, a number that represents a low level of confidence in the accuracy and reliability of the estimate,” the GAO report stated.

Golden future

The tussle over Space Command has taken on new relevance as Trump has emphasized space and missile defense under his Golden Dome initiative.
Trump on Tuesday said locating Space Command in Huntsville would build on north Alabama’s existing strengths in space and missile defense, with the headquarters playing “a key role” in building out Golden Dome
“We will be having a Golden Dome the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before, the finest and best,” he said.
Experts gathered in Huntsville last month for the annual space and missile defense expo stressed that Golden Dome will likely be a layered blend of systems designed to counter different threats – with data and command and control being key problems to solve.
Alabama is already home to a vast and growing defense base that touches aspects of all U.S. missile defense systems. Industry is still awaiting specifics on what will be prioritized – and funded – under Golden Dome procurement.
Strong said Tuesday that politics aside, basing Space Command in Huntsville is the right choice for national security.
“North Alabama has long been the linchpin of defending our interests at home and abroad, and we are prepared to now do our part in defending American interests in space,” Strong said Tuesday. “We have the right people in the right place at the right time.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Space-Command-for-April-15-2025-story-1024x684.png,,,2025-09-02 17:57:58.884768

Tom Millett, R-Marion, right, speaks to a Montanan after a legislative hearing during the 2025 session. (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)A Flathead Valley lawmaker is on the hook for more than $427,000 in unpaid federal taxes — an amount he has disputed — after the U.S. Ninth Circuit Appeals Court declined to take up his appeal from a federal district court. 
Rep. Thomas Millett, R-Marion, did not file federal income taxes from 2004-2009, or 2011-2012, according to court documents, and he filed, but did not pay, federal taxes in 2010 and 2013-2017, except what was withheld by his employer. 
In a ruling handed down by Montana Federal District Court Judge Donald Molloy in 2023, five years of tax liens were found to be legally attached to a property in Marion that Millett previously co-owned; and his disputed tax burden was reduced to a judgement of more than $400,000. 
During initial proceedings before the District Court, Millett stated he was exempt from paying federal taxes because he believed only individuals who work in Washington, D.C., “earn taxable income under the Internal Revenue Code.”
Acting as his own lawyer, he also argued that the government had failed to follow its own collection laws and the IRS had failed to properly notify him of deficiencies for eight of the tax years. But his arguments did not sway the judge, who ruled against him multiple times throughout the case. 
Millett appealed Molloy’s decision up to the Ninth Circuit, but a panel of judges unanimously declined to take up the appeal and affirmed the district court decision, stating Millett offered no evidence contrary to the ruling. 
“The district court’s conclusions were supported by Millett’s tax returns and IRS assessments. For the tax years in which Millett did not file a return, the court’s conclusions were supported by Millett’s own testimony, IRS assessments, copies of notices of deficiency, and certified mailing logs,” the circuit judges wrote. 
Millett told the Daily Montanan in an email that he is still “weighing whether or not to appeal” the circuit decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but “regardless, I will abide by the final decision of the courts.”
“I believe everyone should pay their taxes according to the law. For several years I’ve been in a dispute with the government over how much I owe from several years ago (pre-2018),” Millett wrote. “I believe I owe ‘X’ amount. The government says I owe ‘Y’ amount. I believe the government hasn’t followed the collection laws. They say they have followed the collection laws.”
Millett added that he is current on his taxes after 2018. 
“People may ask, ‘Why take on the federal government?’ The answer is because I believe in exercising my 5th Amendment protected right to due process and for holding everyone, even the federal government, accountable to following the law,” Millett wrote. “This is the same position I have taken when it comes to dealing with government at any level including as the Representative of House District 2.”
Millett served his first term in the Legislature during 2025, representing House District 2, which spans U.S. Highway 2 from Libby to just west of Kalispell. 
During his first term, Millett sponsored 14 bills, four of which were signed into law by Gov. Greg Gianforte. 
The bills that passed included allowing political parties to contribute to judicial candidates; increasing fines for aquatic invasive species violations; and anti-SLAPP legislation protecting citizens and journalists from frivolous lawsuits. 
He also sponsored failed bills to censor municipal judges; support Utah in a lawsuit seeking to transfer federal public lands to the state; promote the use of gold and silver as legal tender; and repeal the 17th Amendment, which provides for direct election of U.S. Senators.  
Millett told the Daily Montanan he intends to run for re-election in 2026.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_3179-scaled-e1756841528638-1024x761.jpg,,,2025-09-02 17:57:58.884768

(Photo courtesy of Bur Oak Land Trust) Since July, grantees of AmeriCorps program funding, including one group in Iowa, have been waiting for their awarded funding for the 2025-2026 fiscal year. 
State attorneys general from 24 states and affected grantees alleged in separate lawsuits that the White House Office of Management and Budget was withholding the funds after preliminary injunctions ordered the program funds be restored.
 OMB released the funds as a filing deadline in the suit waged by the state attorneys general approached, and AmeriCorps grantees announced Tuesday they had also received their withheld funding.  
The release of nearly $185 million from OMB represents “the remaining Fiscal Year 2025 funding” for the programs, according to a filing in the case by OMB and other defendants.
The original suits against the administration stemmed from Department of Government Efficiency cuts to AmeriCorps program funding and staffing that have caused program closures across the country.
Both the attorneys general and grantees amended their original cases in August and alleged OMB was withholding funds it was ordered to release, including one bound for Bur Oak Land Trust, a group that works to preserve natural landscapes in Iowa. 
In addition to programming for nonprofits like Bur Oak Land Trust, AmeriCorps funding goes to place members in schools, local governments and nonprofits that focus on health, disaster relief, environmental stewardship, workforce development and veterans.
Jason Taylor, Bur Oak Land Trust’s executive director said his group was “thrilled” that the funding was released. 
“We’re also really proud to be a part of this lawsuit and to have a number of states’ attorneys general be willing to step up and fight back against what the administration was doing,” Taylor said. 
Taylor said now that the $250,000 the trust was awarded for the 2025-2026 year is realized, a group of AmeriCorps members will be able to start working with the trust this week. Taylor said the funding for the year can support up to 12 AmeriCorps members. 
According to a filing in the case brought by the attorneys general, due to the release of the funds, the parties requested a stay in the preliminary injunction to facilitate their “conferring about the appropriate next steps” in the lawsuit. 
The government agencies, including OMB, in the expanded lawsuit by AmeriCorps grantees, filed for a deadline extension the same day OMB said it would release the funds. The extension was granted Tuesday.
A press release from Democracy Forward, the group that led the lawsuit along with Democracy Defenders Fund, and Lowell & Associates, said the grantees in the case received their promised funding. 
“AmeriCorps has a proven track record of supporting and improving communities across our nation, and is a beacon for the good that the people of our country can do when working together,” Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said in the release. “We are honored to work with our partners and brave plaintiffs to defend against the Trump-Vance administration’s efforts to gut America’s premier national service agency.” 
Kelly Daly, the president of the AmeriCorps Employees Union, AFSCME Local 2027 – also a plaintiff in the suit against OMB – said union members look forward to “continuing our collective mission to strengthen America’s communities and ensure no working family gets left behind.”
Other plaintiffs named in the case with grantees includes: Aspire Afterschool, Democracy Maine, Evelyn Rubenstein Jewish Community Center, Elev8 Baltimore, HandsOn Suburban Chicago, Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey, Michigan College Access Network, National College Attainment Network, North Carolina Housing Coalition, Partners for Campus-Community Engagement, Rainbow Labs, Red Cloud Indian School, Seed Coalition, The Corps Network and The Service Collaborative of WNY.
The 24 states whose attorneys general filed against the administration include Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

Jim Pillen and State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood discuss state investments in public education. July 26, 2023. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A report from Nebraska’s Department of Revenue projects that the federal budget reconciliation bill will cost state government more than $216 million over the next two years. 
The department released the analysis as part of a state law that requires it to report to the Nebraska Legislature within 60 days of a change to the national Internal Revenue Code. Congress’ ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ that passed on July 4 was the subject of Tuesday’s report. 
DOR’s analysis spanned the next four fiscal years ending in 2029. It surmised that the expected losses in corporate and individual income tax revenue will cost Nebraska more than $406 million over those four years. Within the two years that make up the existing biennial budget, the losses would equal roughly $216 million. 
This will likely dent the state budget, but the projected impact won’t be clear until Nebraska’s Economic Forecasting Advisory Board next meets in October. Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent said the board will consider this report, along with several other factors, including the state’s monthly tax receipts, when making state revenue projections.

At the board’s last meeting in July, members confirmed suspicions that Nebraska was back in a projected budget deficit to the tune of about $95 million. That, combined with Gov. Jim Pillen’s stated intent to cut Nebraska’s budget by up to 10%, will make finding revenue to support other measures like tax relief more difficult, according to Appropriations Committee Chair State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood. 
Though the revenue losses were about double what he was expecting, Clements said even if the department’s predictions are accurate the budget will still be “manageable.” He noted that the last two months of tax receipts have been higher than the board’s projections and argued that Pillen’s budget goals could help find savings to offset the new losses. 
“There’s no need to panic at this time,” Clements said.

The department’s report details the fiscal impacts of some specific measures within the federal reconciliation bill. The largest impacts to Nebraska come in corporate income tax revenues, where the bill expands several existing tax deductions and credits for businesses. 
Within the current budget cycle, these changes could cost Nebraska over $140 million in lost tax revenue, according to the report. 
Individual income tax losses make up a smaller but still sizable part of the impact, totaling more than $75 million over the budget’s two-year cycle. The bill similarly adds and expands several tax relief measures for individuals, including increasing the federal child tax credit, for example. 
The report does not touch on the changes to Medicaid, as that does not have a direct impact on tax revenue, DOR spokesman Patrick Roy said. Patent said the budgetary adjustments made in response to these changes likely wouldn’t happen until the state’s next two-year budget.
Despite the coming challenges, Clements said property tax relief still remains a top priority for himself and the governor. Pillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple said the report proves that the federal bill is already providing tax relief to Nebraskans.

Last week, Attorney General Raúl Torrez filed a petition for the state’s highest court to consider removing Martin from her position, citing violations of the law and a hostile work environment including “yelling, screaming, and belittling behavior.” Martin has denied all allegations of hostile work environments. On Sept. 2, following the initial publication of this story, the state Supreme Court directed Martin to submit a response to Torrez’s petition.
A voicemail, text message and email to Martin were not returned before publication. 
The petition was sparked after state lawmakers voted to remove funding from Martin’s office and gave it to the neighboring district attorney in San Juan County, a move spearheaded by  Senate Finance Chair George Muñoz (D-Gallup), citing turnover of Gallup prosecutors. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed the budget, but Martin has refused to cede financial control and filed a lawsuit in Santa Fe court against lawmakers, the governor and San Juan District Attorney Jack Fortner in July, which remains ongoing.
Torrez said in a news release Friday the failure to prosecute cases with defendents accused of murder and rape endangers the community and trust in the office, and will be added to the petition for Martin’s removal.
“The decision to dismiss these cases without properly referring them to another prosecutor jeopardized not only the pursuit of justice for the victims and their families, but also the safety of our communities. By stepping  in immediately, we are making sure these cases move forward and sending a clear message: no victim in New Mexico will be abandoned, and no community will be left unprotected,” Torrez said in a statement.
Further, the New Mexico Department of Justice requested the state’s highest court require the McKinley County District Attorney’s office to provide all information regarding case dismissals and refusals since Jan. 1 2021, saying it’s necessary to determine “how pervasive this problem is.” 
Both cases are several years old, which pushes the clock for statutes of limitations in bringing charges or finding evidence, the news release said. 
The first case was dismissed in 2023, against Tyson Long, now 28, who Gallup Police accused of murdering an unidentified man on Dec. 6, 2022. In court documents, police say they saw Long confronting the victim with a gun before shots were fired and fleeing the area. 
The petition to dismiss Long’s case noted that then-Chief Deputy District Attorney Mandana Shoushtari had stated there was a conflict of interest. 
When reached by phone on Friday, Shoushtari told Source NM she was ordered by Martin to dismiss the case and send it to another district attorney’s office for prosecution. 
“All the witnesses in the case were defendants I was prosecuting in other cases at the time, so by law, I couldn’t put them on the stand and cross-examine them,” she told Source NM.
Shoushtari said she was unclear on the timeline, but said she believed Martin tried to hand the case over to another office. 
“Other DAs were not willing to take cases from her, for whatever reason, but I did know she tried to conflict it out,” Shoushtari said. 
Shoushtari no longer works for Martin’s office, saying she was let go in September of 2024 after “butting heads because I disagreed with the way she was running the office.” Shoushtari is now a deputy district attorney for the 10th Judicial District overseeing De Baca, Harding and Quay counties. 
The second case involves Valentino Roderick Johnson, now 30, who was arrested by McKinley County Sheriff’s deputies on Oct. 28, 2023. According to police reports, a passerby saw a car crash and said he came upon Johnson, heavily intoxicated and on top of a woman screaming for help and banging on the horn, saying that Johnson had raped her. 
Just over a week later, Martin dismissed the case, writing “this complaint is dismissed without prejudice, for reason, conflict for District Attorney’s Office.” 
In the news release, the New Mexico DOJ says that “Martin indicated the defendant was a friend of her children.” 
“Whether it was negligent or intentional, I find it unacceptable that DA Martin dismissed this case [Valentino Roderick Johnson] due to a personal connection to the suspect and it was never refiled,” said McKinley County Sheriff James Maiorano III in a statement. “The victim in this case deserves better, the deputies that worked this case deserve better, and the community deserves better. We are thankful to the NMDOJ for helping us to seek justice.”

During the summer, Trump’s administration sent National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. A federal judge in California on Tuesday ruled that the move violated a federal law against military members conducting domestic law enforcement.
Shapiro noted the ruling and the president’s rhetoric as a reason for the state to be preparing for Trump potentially sending National Guard personnel to Pennsylvania.
“I’m the former chief law enforcement officer of this commonwealth, and I understand what communities need to do to make people safe,” Shapiro said. “As governor, we’ve invested millions of dollars in not only policing, but in community organizations that have helped bring down violent crime by 42%.”

“Now is not a time to disrupt that with distrust, the way the president is doing in other communities,” he added. “Now is the time for us to continue making the progress we’re making here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I’m going to focus on that, but our teams are prepared for whatever the White House may try and send our way.”
Following the ruling from Senior U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer in California, Democratic elected officials in the Golden State celebrated the decision.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who sued to block Trump’s federalization of the state’s National Guard, said the ruling “sided with democracy and the Constitution” and echoed Breyer’s warning about Trump leading a national police force. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass accused the White House of trying to “invade the second largest city in the country.”
Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandan Johnson, both Democrats, have also been outspoken in their opposition to the prospect of the National Guard being sent to Chicago.
“To Chicagoans, what you can do is look out for your communities and your neighbors. Know your rights. Film things that you see happening in your neighborhoods and streets and share them with the news media,” Pritzker said on Tuesday afternoon. “Authoritarians thrive on your silence. Be loud for America.”
Trump has mentioned multiple cities, including Chicago and Baltimore, as potential areas he could send troops to in an effort to combat crime. An FBI report released last month shows violent crime in the United States fell 4.5% in 2024, while property crime dropped 8.1% from the previous year.
Troops are currently patrolling Washington D.C., under what President Trump called a crime emergency. He was able to mobilize the District of Columbia, because the district is not a state.
D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, an elected official, has written on X, formerly Twitter, that the Trump administration’s “actions are unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful.”
“There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia. Violent crime in DC reached historic 30-year lows last year, and is down another 26% so far this year,” Schwalb said.
However, not all elected officials have criticized Trump’s efforts in the nation’s capital. Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, spoke positively about the impact of Trump’s surge of federal law enforcement officers, NBC News reports, although she also claimed that the presence of masked ICE agents and National Guard members “is not working.”
The ruling by Breyer on Tuesday morning that Trump could not use the National Guard for a wide array of police activities in California will go into effect Sept. 12.
However, it is likely that Trump will appeal to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The president secured a victory in an earlier case in that court.
As budget impasse goes beyond 2 months, Shapiro says differences are being narrowed
During Shapiro’s visit to Murrell Dobbins CTE High School on Tuesday, he participated in a panel discussion with American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten and Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker. He also told reporters that he was heading back to Harrisburg on Tuesday afternoon to meet with leaders to continue discussions about the state budget.
“It’s time for them to make some tough decisions to close this out,” Shapiro said. “The issues have been narrowed. They’ve got to make tough decisions and get this done.”
“It’s been 210 days since I introduced my budget. The Senate’s only come to work 26 times since then,” he added. “They’ve got to come back to Harrisburg, do their jobs and pass a budget that includes funding for mass transit.”
Shapiro said he’s “deeply concerned” about the impact of the service cuts from SEPTA on the Philadelphia-region.
Senate Appropriations Chairman Scott Martin, a Republican from Lancaster County, told NBC10 on Aug. 28 that a long-term solution for SEPTA was “not going to happen.”
Shapiro said that he was not going to negotiate the topic of a short term vs long term solution on SEPTA and mass transit funding through the media.
“The caucus that Senator Pittman leads, the Republican caucus in the Senate, has very different views than the Democratic caucus that Leader Bradford leads in the House of Representatives,” Shapiro said. “I’ve been working hard to go back and forth between them to find that common ground, to help our rural brothers and sisters understand that the strength of Philadelphia helps drive our economy, and in many ways, the strength of Philadelphia is predicated upon having a strong mass transit system.”
“I’ve tried to remind all the leaders and the lawmakers that mass transit is an issue that affects us in all 67 counties. I’ve tried to remind them that thanks to our investments in public education, as you’ve heard here today, we’re making significant progress,” he added. “We’ve got to keep making those investments. I’m confident we’ll get there, but finding that common ground between the two leaders, between the two caucuses, is a challenge. We’re going to get there.”
Shapiro wouldn’t get into the details of internal discussions and what the main sticking points were, but said it was his job to find enough Republican and Democratic votes in both chambers to come to a budget agreement.
“I’m confident we can get there, but these two leaders need to make some tough decisions,” he said. “Part of the decisions they need to make are quieting some of the extreme voices within their own caucus.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nationalguard_0-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-02 17:57:58.884768

(Photo bySara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado chapter of the National Rifle Association sued state leadership Tuesday over a sweeping firearm regulation that will require Coloradans to take safety courses to purchase most semiautomatic rifles starting next August.
The Colorado State Shooting Association argues in its lawsuit, filed in federal court in Denver, that Senate Bill 25-3 is unconstitutional on Second Amendment grounds and will not hold up under recent judicial precedent related to firearm laws.
“The Act’s cumbersome and expensive pre-purchase training and certification requirements are also designed to effectively stall, if not stop entirely, those trying to exercise their Second Amendment protected rights,” the lawsuit says.

In addition to CSSA, the plaintiffs include a domestic violence survivor, firearms instructor, wounded Air Force veteran with limited hand mobility, former law enforcement officer, CSSA board member who feels that his identity as a gay Jewish man make him a target for hate crimes, and 19-year-old man who intends to buy a gun in Colorado when he turns 21.
Democratic lawmakers passed SB-3 this year as one of the most comprehensive changes to firearm purchasing requirements in the state’s history. It applies to semiautomatic rifles, shotguns or handguns with detachable magazines and establishes a permit-to-purchase system for those types of guns. It also bans rapid-fire trigger devices.
The bill was sponsored by Sen. Tom Sullivan of Centennial, Sen. Julie Gonzales of Denver, Rep. Andrew Boesenecker of Fort Collins and Rep. Meg Froelich of Englewood, all Democrats.
“They haven’t been successful with their lawsuits in the past and I’m confident that the legislation we passed will stand up to their complaints in a court of law,” Sullivan wrote in a text message to Colorado Newsline.
Froelich said sponsors expect legal challenges when they run “meaningful gun violence prevention legislation,” and they write the policy to withstand those challenges.
A federal judge sided with the state on a challenge to its minimum purchasing age law earlier this summer.
Other states require safety training
Coloradans will need to get an eligibility card from their county sheriff, complete safety training and score at least 90% on a test to be able to purchase SB-3-covered guns. The length of that training will depend on whether the person has already completed a hunter education course through Colorado Parks and Wildlife.
It is not yet clear how much the process could cost from start to finish. During debate on the bill, Republicans argued that an already-strained CPW could not absorb increased demand for hunter safety courses.
The lawsuit alleges that the process will impose onerous requirements on the plaintiff’s right to own common firearms used for self defense.
“The Act infringes on the individual Plaintiffs’ ability to do so by prohibiting the acquisition and possession of particular firearms and firearm-related equipment, and by imposing a pre-purchase permitting scheme that consists of a complicated and multilayered application process, lengthy wait times, extensive course requirements, and numerous and costly fees,” it says.
The requirements do not apply for the purchase of semi-automatic firearms with permanently attached magazines that comply with the state’s ammunition limits.
The lawsuit also alleges that there is no historical tradition for this type of regulation, so the law will not hold up in the context of U.S. Supreme Court decisions like New York Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen from 2022. Ten states require gun buyers to complete safety training, according to Everytown for Gun Safety.
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis’ office declined to comment on the pending litigation. In his signing statement for the bill, however, Polis wrote that the bill “ensures that our Second Amendment rights are protected and that Coloradans can continue to purchase the gun of their choice for sport, hunting, self defense, or home defense.”
CSSA is using lawyers from Mountain States Legal Foundation, the firm behind a challenge against New Mexico’s gun purchase waiting period law. A panel of federal appellate judges recently decided that the law is likely unconstitutional and sent the question back to the lower court.
The plaintiffs in the Colorado case are demanding a jury trial.

(Photo by Shannon Hahh for The Madison County Record)This story first appeared in the Madison County Record and is republished here, with light editing, by permission.
A decertification hearing for a former Madison County sheriff’s deputy who didn’t respond to a 911 call has been postponed, according to an Arkansas Department of Public Safety spokesperson.
The hearing to strip former deputy Blake Hassell of his law enforcement credential had been scheduled for Sept. 9, but the Commission on Law Enforcement Standards and Training (CLEST) hearing is being rescheduled due to “some administrative delays unrelated to the case,” according to Nick Gentry, DPS deputy communications director for the Department of Public Safety and Shared Services Division. 
CLEST may revoke a law enforcement officer’s certification after written notice and hearing if the commission finds an officer has broken the Law Enforcement Code of Ethics. 
Madison County Sheriff Ronnie Boyd requested Hassell’s decertification in November, stating Hassell did not respond to a 911 call placed Aug. 5, 2024, in which a caller reported a woman yelling for help. Hassell initially said he had responded, but when questioned about the call, he admitted he had not.
Five weeks after the call, human remains were found in the area of the 911 call.
CLEST voted in January to proceed with a hearing. Hassell’s attorney, Christopher Plumlee, said at the time that Hassell intended to contest any challenge to his certification as well as defend his name and reputation. 
Gentry said neither Hassell nor Boyd requested the delay.
 Parole officer’s body found

	 
On Sept. 5, 2024, a parole and probation officer reported Taylor Barksdale was missing. Boyd said he began investigating her disappearance on Sept. 6, 2024.
After finding human remains on Sept. 9, 2024, and opening a potential homicide investigation, Boyd identified the remains as belonging to Barksdale. 
A press release from the sheriff’s office about a potential homicide appears to have been written and saved on Sept. 13, 2024. However, Boyd delayed sending the release until Sept. 18, 2024, just a few hours after The Record submitted a public records’ request for information about human remains being found in the Kingston area.
Boyd has stated several times that more information will be presented at the decertification hearing as to why neither he nor Sgt. Drew Scott, Hassell’s immediate supervisor, responded on Aug. 5, 2024, the day they learned Hassell had not. 
“More of that stuff’s going to be figured out in the decertification hearing,” Boyd said. He said he had a “thought process” as to why he did not respond, adding, “at this point, I don’t think I need to elaborate on that at that moment.”
In January, Boyd said no one from the sheriff’s office followed up because the call, “was an emergency call and, you know, we didn’t receive another call after that.”
Barksdale’s case remains an open investigation. No arrests have been made. 
Fourth Judicial District Prosecuting Attorney Brandon Carter said providing any updates on the investigation would be detrimental to the case. 
The Barksdale family met with Carter two weeks ago, requesting a copy of the autopsy report from the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory, which they say Boyd has refused to release. The family also asked for more involvement from the Arkansas State Police in the case.
Carter said he had no comment on the meeting, the autopsy report or the state police’s involvement. 
“My conversations with the family are going to stay between me and the family,” Carter said. 
Sammi Wilmoth, attorney for the Barksdale family, also declined to comment on the meeting.  Wilmoth said the family is “hopeful that whoever committed this crime will be held accountable. We’re still hopeful that will happen.” 
Aug. 5, 2024, 911 Call 
Kortney Cline said she called 911 on Aug. 5, 2024, at 12:34 a.m.  
The sheriff’s office’s “dispatch call detail” report shows Cline told dispatchers that she “heard a woman in the woods behind her house yelling. Stated she believes at one point the woman screamed ‘help.’ Caller advised there is not a physical address. But it is an area where a bunch of homeless people were camped out.”
The sheriff’s office declined a public records request by The Record to release the audio of the 911 call, stating it was part of an open investigation. 
Matt Durrett, former prosecuting attorney for Washington and Madison counties, told another media outlet in September 2024: “The caller reported that she could hear a woman screaming and it sounded as if she were in distress. Sounded, perhaps she was being beaten or being tortured.”
Hassell initially said he responded, and the dispatch report shows a notation that the call was closed at 1:14 a.m. with the notation, “No signs of anyone here.”
After confronting Hassell about the 911 call and learning Hassell had not responded, Scott wrote a “verbal counseling” statement.
Scott’s statement tendered to CLEST was dated Aug. 6. That same statement, given to The Record, showed a marking through the number 6 with  “corrected date 5” written.
In that statement, Scott wrote he asked Hassell why he did not respond. The statement notes Hassell told Scott that he “was just out in the area approximately 30 minutes to an hour prior [to the 911 call] and did not hear anything.”
In a statement written by the sheriff, dated Sept. 17, 2024, and submitted to CLEST, Boyd said he informed Hassell on Sept. 11, 2024, that he was working on a missing person case involving a woman who could have been the person yelling for help. 
“I informed him that all signs were leading back to the night of the call that he failed to respond and lied, saying he did,” Boyd wrote. 
Boyd wrote that he told Hassell he “did not see any possible way” that Hassell could remain employed by the sheriff’s office.
Hassell asked for “further consideration on the matter,” Boyd wrote.
“After taking some additional time, I came to the same conclusion that Deputy Hassell could no longer be an effective representative of the Sheriff’s Office,” Boyd wrote.
In a text message last year, Hassell denied lying.
“I was honest about why I did not respond from the very first time I was asked about it,” Hassell wrote.
Last year, when The Record asked Boyd what Hassell said when Boyd confronted him about not responding, Boyd said, “I never got a good answer.”
According to employment records submitted to CLEST, Hassell worked for the Springdale Police Department from Aug. 5, 2019,  to July 29, 2021. 
Hassell was hired by the Madison County Sheriff’s Office on April 3, 2024, and resigned Sept. 11, 2024, in lieu of being fired. 
Hassell did not respond to a request by The Record for comment for this article. 
Hassell’s Statements
Last September, when asked about the 911 call, Hassell told The Record he didn’t know anything about it nor Barksdale’s death. He later issued a statement to The Record saying he was at the location twice prior to the 911 call and there were no signs of anyone being there. 
If Hassell was in the area prior to the 911 call, Cline said, “he didn’t come down my road.”
Hassell said the residents of the area “were known to be off their medication and not in their proper state of mind,” and “screaming and chasing objects that are not there.”
Cline said when she placed the call, she didn’t identify anyone by name or refer to anyone on medications.
Hassell said that at the time of the 911 call, he was working a “very high priority investigation.”
“Due to my past experience of false 911 calls at that location and vagueness of the call, it was not determined to be a high priority at the time,” Hassell wrote in a previous text message to The Record. 
Cline has made several calls to the sheriff’s office over the course of several years. 
But, she said, “There’s no abuse of 911.” 
In January, Boyd issued a response to Hassell’s statement about false 911 calls. 
“I want to clarify that the Madison County Sheriff’s Office has never said that there was a history of 911 calls from the residence of the caller,” Boyd wrote.
“We have no record of there being any intentionally false emergency calls from that residence. Frequently, the caller and law enforcement cannot determine if there is an actual emergency until someone gets on the scene,” Boyd said. 
In Boyd’s Sept. 17, 2024, statement the sheriff said Hassell was “counseled on the importance of answering calls and not letting past incidents cloud present events.”
Cline has been the subject of podcasts and Facebook accounts criticizing her for allegedly calling 911 numerous times. She said she worries the criticism could scare people away from making future 911 calls when needed. 
She said she had been told by the sheriff’s office that law enforcement needs to have “just cause” to investigate and “can’t just pull up on” residents in the camper that was near her home.  
She said the Aug. 5 call provided reason for someone from the sheriff’s office to come to the area and “nobody did.”
Caller Follows Up
Cline said she felt the screams for help she heard on Aug. 5, 2024, constituted an emergency when she made the initial 911 call.
“I do know I absolutely wasn’t like, ‘I don’t know, you might should come,’” she said.
She said she heard the screams throughout the night, so she called again — and again, she said, no one responded. 
Boyd has stated repeatedly that no evidence of a second 911 call exists.
“I know I called a second time” Cline said, “because I talked to a male and a female,” two different dispatchers. 
Madison County time sheet records show dispatchers Collin Kilbourn and Mickayla Littrell worked the night of Aug. 5. 
“The reason I know there’s a second call is because the girl told me, when I said, ‘No one came,’ she said, ‘Yes, he did. He was there, and he knocked on their front door and no one answered,’” Cline said. 
“And I said, ‘Well, then this is how I know you’re wrong. There is no front door. They’re in a camper.’ So I’m sure about that,” Cline said. 
Cline also followed up again mid-morning on Aug. 5, 2024, sending Boyd an email about no one responding. Cline told Boyd she called 911 because she could hear a woman screaming. 
“I don’t know how she was being assaulted, but the screaming went on for hours,” she wrote to Boyd. Cline told Boyd she waited until 3 a.m. thinking an officer would respond.
“No one showed up,” she wrote. 
She told Boyd she was frustrated because a legitimate reason existed for the sheriff’s office to investigate but nobody responded. 
In a response email approximately 30 minutes later, Boyd wrote, “We had a deputy go out there around 1:14 AM, and he did not see any signs of anyone in the area. I haven’t been able to talk to him, so I can’t give you any details further than that.”
Cline emailed back, telling Boyd she appreciated him getting back to her, and wrote, “I assure you, no one came.”
Cline said she didn’t hear from Boyd again until he showed up at her house letting her know that they had found “the girl I called about.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250826-Madison-County-Sheriffs-Office-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-02 17:57:58.884768

Free.,Judges in two federal cases cite due process to block Trump immigration moves,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judges-two-federal-cases-cite-due-process-block-trump-immigration-moves,,"WASHINGTON — A pair of federal court rulings over the Labor Day weekend invalidated aggressive actions the Trump administration had taken on immigration enforcement.Judge Sparkle Sooknanan ordered an unknown number of planes carrying unaccompanied Guatemalan children temporarily halted on Sunday, two days after Judge Jia Cobb struck down a policy used to bypass judicial review in quick removals of migrants far from the southern border. Both judges are of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.The rulings are part of an ongoing clash between President Donald Trump and the federal judiciary over the administration’s immigration crackdown. Judges have raised concerns that immigrants’ due process rights are being violated.On Sunday, Sooknanan voiced concern for unaccompanied children’s due process rights, and temporarily halted planes carrying the minors from taking off. The administration had planned to deport 10 children to their home country of Guatemala. The case resembled one earlier this year in which a judge ordered planes carrying Venezuelan men removed under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 grounded. Despite the order, multiple planes landed in El Salvador where more than 200 Venezuelans were sent to a notorious mega-prison.The 10 children, nationals of Guatemala, on the planes ranged in age from 10 to 17 and crossed the southern border alone. Attorneys in court filings stressed that the children had immigration cases pending before a judge and that the children expressed fear of returning to Guatemala. ‘Everyone would be at risk’The order followed Cobb’s order Friday granting a request from immigration rights groups to halt the implementation of a new policy that expanded expedited removal.The administration has expanded the use of expedited removal, which allows for the quick removal of migrants, as a pillar of its aim to carry out mass deportations of people without permanent legal status. For decades, administrations have applied expedited removal to immigrants apprehended at the southern border who cannot prove they have been in the United States for more than two years. If they cannot produce that proof, they are subject to a fast-track deportation without appearing before an immigration judge.The Trump administration in January expanded expedited removal to apply nationwide, rather than only within 100 miles of the southern border.In Cobb’s Friday opinion, she wrote that the administration likely violated the rights of immigrants and approached a universal violation of the constitutional right to due process. Former President Joe Biden appointed Cobb in 2021.“In defending this skimpy process, the Government makes a truly startling argument: that those who entered the country illegally are entitled to no process under the Fifth Amendment, but instead must accept whatever grace Congress affords them,” she wrote. “Were that right, not only noncitizens, but everyone would be at risk.” Flights of Guatemalan minors groundedIn a flurry of action Sunday, Sooknanan temporarily halted the deportation of the children for 14 days while the case continues after an emergency request from the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group.Attorneys from NILC argued that if the children were returned, they could face violence and the administration's move to deport them violated immigration procedures for unaccompanied minors.“Defendants are imminently planning to illegally transfer Plaintiffs to Immigration and Customs Enforcement … custody to put them on flights to Guatemala, where they may face abuse, neglect, persecution, or even torture, against their best interests,” the attorneys wrote in their emergency filing.The 10 children on the planes were taken off and put back into the custody of  the Office of Refugee Resettlement, according to a status update filed Monday by NILC lawyers.The Trump administration has identified up to 600 Guatemalan children to be removed under a pilot program created through an agreement with Guatemala, according to the court filings. Sooknanan’s order applies to all roughly 2,000 Guatemalan unaccompanied children in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Biden also appointed Sooknanan.Carlos Ramíro Martínez, Guatemala’s minister of foreign affairs, told the New York Times in an interview that the initiative began when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited Guatemala in July. He added there is an agreement for Guatemala to accept more than 600 children. DHS did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.The State Department’s 2024 report on Guatemala details human rights concerns such as violence, and advises against traveling to the country. The case involving the unaccompanied children was reassigned to judge Timothy James Kelly, whom Trump appointed in 2017.",,,,2025-09-02 17:57:58.884768

All successful. They went very well, like this is going very well. And then I didn't do any for two days, and they said, ‘There must be something wrong with him.’ Biden wouldn't do them for months. You wouldn't see him.”Trump then said that he had heard about the online speculation of his death, but that he didn’t realize how extensive the rumors were.“No, I heard that. I get reports,” Trump said. “Now you knew I did an interview that lasted for about an hour and a half with somebody, and everybody saw. That was on one of your competitors. I did numerous shows, and also did a number of truths, long truths. I think, pretty poignant truths. No, I was very active over the weekend.”Trump added a few moments later: “I didn't hear that one. That's pretty serious stuff.”The rumors that Trump had potentially died began circulating online Friday but began dissipating on Saturday, Sunday and Monday after the group of reporters that follows the president around saw him walk into his golf club in Virginia each of those three days.",,,,2025-09-02 16:56:55.895681

(Photo courtesy of Raise the Wage Oklahoma)OKLAHOMA CITY — Spending on crime, incarceration, and corrections would be reduced in Oklahoma if the minimum wage were raised to $15, according to a report. 
Higher wages could help break the “cycle of poverty and incarceration” while reducing the burden on law enforcement, according to a report from This Land Research and Communications Collaborative, a nonpartisan research group. The report was compiled by Scioto Analysis, a public policy analysis firm.  
“We find that a $15 minimum wage could yield significant public safety benefits for Oklahoma, particularly by reducing violent crime and its associated human and economic toll,” the report found. “These effects are most concentrated among young, low-wage populations and may help mitigate some of the state’s historically high incarceration rates while promoting reintegration into the workforce.”
Voters will decide whether or not to raise Oklahoma’s minimum wage  in the June 2026 primary election. If approved by voters, State Question 832 would gradually increase the $7.25 an hour minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2029. Additional increases would be tied to the cost of living measured by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Consumer Price Index.
Oklahoma would see 7,000 less crimes per year, or a decrease of 3%, the report predicts. Most of these are estimated to be property crimes. 
The state would have to increase police forces by 11%, or about 1,000 officers, to achieve the same result. This would cost Oklahoma about $58 million per year, the report found. 
“These findings make clear that raising wages is not only an economic issue, but a public safety issue,” said Rob Moore, principal researcher for Scioto Analysis. “When people can earn a fair wage, they are less likely to be pushed toward crime and more likely to build stable, thriving lives. This new analysis clearly shows raising the minimum wage isn’t just about higher wages, it’s about building better, safer communities, while saving taxpayers millions of dollars.” 
The decrease in crime would reduce the incarcerated population by about 370 people per year and lower recidivism by about 6%, according to the report’s estimates. This could save Oklahoma’s correctional system $5.7 million annually. 
Oklahoma had the fifth-highest incarceration rate in the U.S. as of 2022, the report found.

(Photo courtesy of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Newport County)The State Properties Committee voted Tuesday to transfer the ownership of an addition to a community center in Newport’s north end from the Rhode Island Department of Education to the local public housing authority. The transfer is necessary to comply with requirements for using federal pandemic relief money to renovate the site.
“These funds really allow us to transform that building, modernize it for 21st century learning,”Rhonda Mitchell, executive director for the Housing Authority of Newport, told the committee.
The unanimous decision returns the vacant “Gallagher Wing” of the Florence Gray Center on York Street back to the Housing Authority of Newport so plans can proceed to renovate the center into an Aquidneck Island community hub.
That will allow the authority to access all $7.5 million in Community Learning Center Municipal Grants awarded in 2024 for capital projects that must be completed by October 2026. The money comes from the American Public Rescue Plan Act of 2021. 
The work includes upgrades to the interior layout, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, interior finishes, fixtures and equipment. The wing will get a new interior staircase and hallways, along with a tele-medicine room, two computer labs, four multipurpose rooms, and seven classrooms.
“We’ve got a construction team lined up ready to work,”Mitchell said in an interview after the vote.
The Rhode Island Department of Education has owned the center’s Gallagher Wing since 2011 when construction began on the Met School’s Paul W. Crowley East Bay Campus next door to the community center. The Met is a network of six small, public high schools in Providence and Newport. 
At the time, the state-operated Met Center planned to use the two-story Gallagher Wing to hold classes, offices, and other school functions, according to a letter from the RIDE Chief Operating Officer Mario Carreño to the committee.
But the Met Center has hardly used the space, Carreño wrote. And because the federal grant does not cover renovations in existing school buildings, the Housing Authority would only be able to fix around 80% of the building.
“It would be just left vacant if it weren’t transferred,” Carreño told the committee.
Mitchell called the reacquisition “a huge milestone” as the authority has sought to upgrade the building since 2017. 
Community Learning Center Municipal Grants have provided $81.7 million to Rhode Island cities and towns to renovate, add on to or build new buildings, such as recreation centers, community centers, wellness hubs and libraries.
As of mid-July, the state’s website notes that a little over $540,000 of the total $7.5 million had been spent on the project, mostly toward contractors’ architectural and engineering fees. 
With the project completion deadline now 13 months away, the building as of Tuesday is   fully under the authority’s control. 
A copy of the state’s transfer deal was not immediately made available. Carreño told the committee that while the agreement carries no cost, the state will require the Housing Authority of Newport to keep the space off the market for the next 10 years.
Mitchell said she does not anticipate such a sale would ever happen.
“We would envision that it’s always a community center,” she said. 
The building has several tenants including Fab Newport, the East Bay Community Action Program, Turning Around Ministries, and Boys & Girls Clubs of Newport County.

,DC,2025-09-02 20:47:44+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump moves Space Command from Colorado to Alabama, capping yearslong fight",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-moves-space-command-colorado-alabama-capping-yearslong-fight,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced Tuesday the U.S. Space Command will permanently relocate to Huntsville, Alabama, vacating its temporary headquarters in Colorado.The move reverts back to Trump’s plans during his first administration to locate the combatant command in Alabama to oversee Space Force, the military branch he created in 2019. Space Force headquarters has since operated out of Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs. The command’s location has been a yearslong political fight.“As you know, this has been going on for a long period of time, and I am thrilled to report that the U.S. Space Command headquarters will move to the beautiful locale of a place called Huntsville, Alabama, forever to be known from this point forward as ‘Rocket City,’” said Trump, flanked by Alabama Republicans in the Oval Office Tuesday afternoon. “We love Alabama. I only won it by about 47 points. I don't think that influenced my decision though,” he said. (Trump won Alabama’s nine Electoral College votes in November by 31 percentage points, according to The Associated Press. Former Vice President Kamala Harris won Colorado’s 10 Electoral College votes by 11 percentage points.)Trump said his plans to root Space Command at the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville were “wrongfully obstructed by the Biden administration.”The Biden administration decided in July 2023 to keep Space Command in Colorado Springs to ensure “peak readiness in the space domain,” according to a Department of Defense Inspector General report released in April 2025. The IG’s report was inconclusive on why the Air Force did not push back on the decision, despite the department’s preference for Alabama.“Today, we're moving forward with what we want to do and the place that we want to have this, and this will be there for hopefully hundreds of years,” Trump said. “I will say, I want to thank Colorado. The problem I have with Colorado, one of the big problems, they do mail-in voting. They went to all mail-in voting, so they have automatically crooked elections.”Since his election loss to Biden in 2020, Trump has repeated unfounded claims about mail-in ballots and their effect on elections.Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said the president is “restoring (Space Command) to precisely where it should be.”“Whoever controls the skies will control the future of warfare, and Mr. President, today you're ensuring that happens,” Hegseth said.Alabama Republicans rejoice over Space CommandAlabama’s Republican U.S. Sens. Tommy Tuberville and Katie Britt both praised the president as they stood beside him in the Oval Office.“Mr. President, we are grateful for your leadership on this and restoring Space Command to its rightful home in Huntsville, Alabama,” Britt said, adding the accusation that “obviously the Biden administration chose to make this political.”Tuberville said the move will save taxpayers $480 million. States Newsroom has not independently verified that figure, and the April IG report did not cite specific relocation costs. He also highlighted the presence of NASA in Huntsville as an advantage.“I spoke with the president for the last three or four years about this. If I thought it needed to go somewhere else, because (of) the security of our country, I'd be for that. But the best place for Space Command is Huntsville, Alabama, because what we have and what it means to this country is going to be so important,” Tuberville said.Lawsuit vowed by Colorado AGBut Colorado elected officials aren’t backing down. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, described the decision as “deeply disappointing” for his state and “a waste of taxpayer dollars.”Colorado’s Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a statement Tuesday that he plans to take the administration to court over the “unlawful” relocation, which he described as “political games.”“Moving Space Command Headquarters to Alabama is not only wrong for our national defense, but it’s harmful to hundreds of Space Command personnel and their families. These El Paso County residents are our neighbors. They relied on the federal government’s decision to keep Space Command HQ in Colorado Springs — they bought homes for their families, selected schools for their children, and have contributed to the local economy.” Weiser said. “The Colorado Attorney General’s Office has been preparing in the event the president made such an unlawful decision to move Space Command HQ. If the Trump administration takes this step — I’m prepared to challenge it in court.”Colorado’s entire bipartisan congressional delegation released a statement Tuesday slamming the relocation announcement.“Today’s decision to move U.S. Space Command’s headquarters out of Colorado and to Alabama will directly harm our state and the nation. We are united in fighting to reverse this decision. Bottom line—moving Space Command headquarters weakens our national security at the worst possible time,” according to the statement.",,,,2025-09-02 16:56:55.895681

(File photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)A new committee formed to investigate New Hampshire domestic violence fatalities will begin meeting this fall and will initially focus on a high-profile murder suicide in Berlin this summer, the Department of Justice announced Tuesday.
The Domestic Violence Fatality Review Committee, created this year by Senate Bill 140, is charged with carrying out “comprehensive, multidisciplinary reviews” of domestic violence-related deaths, according to the statute. Those reviews are meant to evaluate the responses of police and government agencies, identify barriers to victim safety, and produce recommendations to improve the systems.
On July 6, Michael Gleason Jr. shot and killed his estranged wife, Marisol Fuentes-Huaracha, and then fatally shot himself at a restaurant in Berlin, police say. Gleason had been released on cash bail despite facing serious domestic violence charges months earlier, and was supposed to have relinquished his firearms as part of a protective order. The murder has sparked political outrage and a damning internal review by the judicial branch that found multiple points of failure among the courts to prevent the tragedy.
According to the Department of Justice, the committee’s 17 members include several state officials, such as Attorney General John Formella; Chief Medical Examiner Jennie Duval; Director of the Division for Behavioral Health Katja Fox; and Mike Donati, chief of the Bureau of Community, Family and Program Supports at the Division for Children, Youth and Families.
Circuit Court Administrative Judge Ellen Christo will represent the judicial branch and Deanna Campbell, the managing attorney of the New Hampshire Public Defender, will also serve. 
The list also includes representatives from domestic violence prevention organizations, such as the New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, Ending the Violence, and WISE. It also has law enforcement members representing the New Hampshire State Police, Manchester Police Department, and the Jackson Police Department, and two assistant county attorneys from Cheshire and Merrimack counties.
The announcement said the committee would review the Fuentes-Huaracha case first at the request of Gov. Kelly Ayotte. 
But Formella said the committee had broad goals, noting that “more than half” of homicides handled by his office relate to domestic violence.
“Each of these tragedies has a devastating impact — not only on the families and friends of the victims, but on the broader community,” he said. “The work of this committee is designed to ensure that we are learning from these cases, strengthening our systems, and doing everything we can to prevent future fatalities. With this membership in place, New Hampshire is taking an important step forward in strengthening our response to domestic violence.”
The committee will hold its first meeting in September or October, the announcement said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/formellaydc-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-02 16:56:55.895681

On Tuesday, Ann Arbor for Public Power announced that its members are drafting a ballot proposal for the November 2026 election, asking voters to create a new board of public electric utility, before taking over infrastructure from DTE Energy at a later date. 
DTE Energy is one of the largest energy utilities in the state and has faced frequent criticism for high rates and unreliable electricity. According to the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan, an energy utility watchdog, DTE customers experienced an average of 1,542 minutes without power in 2023, ranking among the worst utilities in the nation for outages.

In its announcement, the group argued that shifting energy to a public power utility would be highly likely to provide more reliable, more renewable, and less costly power to Ann Arbor residents.  
“The first question for voters is: do you want this? The plan is to create the board of the public utility in the 2026 election, before taking over poles and wires from DTE. Creating the board will cost the people of Ann Arbor zero dollars, and it will put the process of dumping DTE in motion,” Ann Arbor For Public Power’s Executive Director Brian Geiringer said in a statement. 
After language for the effort is approved, the group will need to gather 5,000 signatures to have the matter placed on the ballot. 
DTE did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication.

Unions across Brown University and its health care network have banded together to form a new labor federation with about 7,000 members total.
In a Monday announcement, the Brown University Labor Council (BULC) branded itself as “the first effort at creating a cross-sector labor organization” since the Ivy League school merged with Lifespan to form Brown University Health last summer.  
The council’s president, Maddock Thomas, said in a statement that it will work to unify Brown workers across any respective labor campaigns, contract talks, and picket lines. Beginning Sept. 15, the council plans to hold a series of educational events on labor organization to help workers get involved in their unions and organize their workplaces.
“In this time of overlapping crises, the voice of labor is crucial,” Thomas wrote. “A strong labor movement means that working people will have a seat at the table as we work to solve these problems. The BULC allows us to build a cohesive labor movement for workers affiliated with Brown across all sectors and workplaces.”
Labor organizations in the council include:

Brown chapter of American Association of University Professors
Brown University Postdoc Labor Organization
Brown Health and Care New England units of Committee of Interns and Residents
Graduate Labor Organization
Brown Student Labor Alliance
Transdev and Rhode Island Hospital units of Teamsters Local 251 
United Nurses and Allied Professionals (UNAP) Local 5098
Library and dining units of United Service and Allied Workers of Rhode Island

The federation wants to align and coordinate union activities and contract timelines, and intends to pursue joint bargaining efforts, according to its website.
The federation’s constitution details that each member union gets two voting delegates on the council. Those delegates can vote for the  federation’s executive board, which includes a president, secretary-treasurer, and two vice presidents. Meetings will typically be monthly, according to the constitution.
The council cited uncertainty about federal health care and higher ed funding among reasons for the group’s formation. The council’s statement also took aim at Brown’s recent handshake with the federal government. The school settled with the feds in July to conclude three separate investigations into alleged civil rights violations on campus, including the use of race-conscious admissions and accusations of a climate of antisemitism on campus. 
Brown agreed to end race-conscious admissions as part of the agreement. While the university maintains that the July agreement will not impact academic freedom on campus, the agreement has also drawn criticism because it requires the school to employ binary definitions of gender in student athletics, locker rooms and dormitories. The university also needs to submit detailed annual reports on admissions data and provides new avenues for students to report suspected antisemitism on campus. 
The agreement with the feds “abandons much of the University’s core educational mission and puts community members at risk,” the labor council’s announcement stated.

Josh Stein signs an executive order on state government's use of artificial intelligence on Sept. 2, 2025. (Photo by Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said Tuesday he is creating a council to study and begin using artificial intelligence within state government, signing an executive order and sketching out what he described as a years-long plan to use the technology for “economic growth and attract innovation.”
The AI announcement came alongside another long-term blueprint to attract business in the biotech industry, as well as a plan to make North Carolina’s public schools “the best in the country.”
Stein’s Tuesday order creates a leadership council that will study how state workers should use AI. It will be chaired by Lee Lilley, the secretary of the Department of Commerce, and Teena Piccione, the secretary of the Department of Information Technology who joined the administration from a senior leadership role at Google.
Piccione’s department will also house a new “AI accelerator,” which will “explore and implement AI solutions to real world problems,” Piccione said. And state agencies will each have an “oversight team” guiding proper uses of AI.
The goal, she said, was to make North Carolina the “most AI-literate state government workforce in the nation.”

Still, she and the governor acknowledged that uncertainty reigns as states grapple with AI’s limits and flaws. It presents “serious risks” alongside “extraordinary possibilities,” Stein said, and added that the state had created a “framework” to help guide state workers on how to use, or not use, the technology. He pointed to agencies like the bogged-down DMV that he believes could be more efficient at “getting people through the system quicker.”
What does that mean for state workers whose jobs could heavily overlap with AI usage? Nothing right now, Stein said — though he acknowledged that could change in the future.
“I’m not denying that there may be employment consequences,” Stein said. “But we are nowhere near that at this point.”
Other sectors of North Carolina government have already ventured into AI usage and policy. State Treasurer Brad Briner’s office partnered with OpenAI earlier this year in an effort to make parts of that office’s work more efficiently. And state lawmakers have filed more than two dozen bills on the topic so far this session: dealing with everything from algorithmic rent fixing to AI ethics and literacy in K-12 education.
Governments across the U.S. at all levels have begun to lean more into AI use — and regulation. Many cities have developed “guidelines” to steer workers’ use of AI. Congress, as members debated what would become a massive tax and spending bill, weighed banning states from regulating AI. That language was stripped out before the package became law.

(Photo by Caity Coyne/West Virginia Watch)The West Virginia Public Service Commission last week denied a bulk of the power rate increase requested by Appalachian Power according to an order filed by the PSC on Thursday evening.
Appalachian Power and Wheeling Power, subsidiaries of American Electric Power, were seeking a $250.5 million increase that would have made residential customers pay about $24 more on their monthly bills. 
The PSC, in its order Thursday, denied all but about $76 million of the companies’ request. For now, that $76.1 million increase will not come out of customers’ pockets, according to the order.
The PSC said another decision will be forthcoming regarding a plan by Appalachian Power to securitize some of the company’s assets through the issuance of bonds to help increase revenue. That proposal, per the order, would spread costs out over an extended period of time in an attempt to lighten the burden put on individual customers.
If approved, the securitization plan could see customer bills increasing by about $7 a month. The bonds issued would be paid off by customers through this increase over the next 20 years.
“Thousands of West Virginians spoke out against unaffordable rate hikes and difficulty managing the ever-growing cost of energy, and the PSC’s decision reflects the power of public input to ease the burden on families,” Dani Parent, executive director of the West Virginia Citizen Action Group, said in a statement.
The rate increase was initially filed in November 2024 for the second time. A previous request from the company to raise rates was dismissed by the PSC last year due to it lacking adequate information.
Since last November, at least 5,081 residents have submitted letters of protest to the PSC regarding the requested rate hike. There were no letters sent to the agency in support of the increased rates.
“It goes to show you how engaged people are around these issues. More than 5,000 West Virginians took the time to speak out because they know what’s at stake. We think that’s more than any other case in PSC history,” said Courtney MacDonald with the West Virginians for Energy Freedom coalition. “Residents and businesses are tired of seeing their bills go up and paying for unreliable service. Keeping the lights on shouldn’t be a universal struggle.”
At the end of 2024, according to AEP, the company saw nearly $3 billion in profits for its shareholders.
According to a 2022 review of electric utilities across the country, West Virginians paid the third highest total household electricity costs as a percentage of their income. Alabama and Mississippi, according to the study from the consumer advocacy group Citizens Utility Board of Illinois, were the only states where prices outpaced that of the Mountain State.
West Virginia AEP customers have already undergone 14 rate increases from the company between 2017 and March 2023, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail. In the last five years alone, according to Appalachian Power, residential rates for electricity have risen from $128.09 in March 2019 to $169.93 in June 2024. That’s a 32.6% increase in rates.
PSC order expands low-income assistance programs, more
In its order last week, the PSC also made moves to expand programs that assist low-income customers.
The agency made the Dollar Energy Fund, which helps qualifying residents pay utility costs and avoid shutoffs, available year-round instead of only in winter months. The PSC also increased the amount of money available to individuals from $300 up to $500.
The commission also lowered reconnection charges, meaning residents will have to pay less if their power is shut off due to nonpayment. Previously, reconnections could cost up to $75.
“Expanding the Dollar Energy Fund will provide significant relief for the West Virginians who need it most,” Parent said.
The PSC is also requiring AEP to study what the impact would be in offering discount power rates to low-income families during summer months. Currently, discount rates are only available in the winter.
In addition to requesting a rate increase, Appalachian Power had also asked the PSC to decrease net-metering credits that allow customers who install solar panels on their homes to sell the excess generated electricity back to the grid at retail price and lower their own utility costs. 
The proposal from AEP would have meant a near-67% decrease in what is currently paid for that power which would have been a detriment to solar production in the state, according to West Virginians for Energy Freedom.
The PSC did end 1:1 credits for net-metering, but the rate — as well as the time frame to be grandfathered into the program — were expanded. Residents will have a year longer than Appalachian Power requested to apply for the net-metering program and install solar on their homes. 
Residents who install solar power systems after that period ends and participate in net-metering will earn about 12.4 cents per a kilowatt hour generated, which is between 67% and 75% of the full retail rate.
“Although we are losing the 1:1 retail credit, The PSC’s decision on the new bill credit rate preserves the right of West Virginians’ to participate fairly in our energy system,” said Leah Turgeon, the state director for Solar United Neighbors in West Virginia. “Under this order, solar owners and those who wish to take control of where their energy comes from will continue to benefit from distributed solar power into the future — a win for West Virginia’s solar industry and residents alike.”

As Georgia Covid rates rise, people who want to get the latest vaccine as it hits pharmacy shelves over the coming weeks will likely face a new hitch: They’ll need a doctor’s prescription, at least for now.
Pharmacies became a key distributor of Covid shots during the pandemic, and many Georgians are used to getting annual flu and Covid shots there.
But uncertainty about how the federal government is regulating the newest Covid shots, which have been updated for the 2025-26 season and are starting to arrive in stores, has created a new wrinkle in that process.
Many pharmacies in Georgia said they will require a prescription for the shot until an influential federal committee meets and makes firm recommendations on who should get the vaccine, expected in September. Those pharmacies include CVS, as well as independent drugstores.
“Everyone will need a [prescription] until ACIP makes a recommendation,” said Dr. Johnathan Hamrick, a member of the board of directors of the Georgia Pharmacy Association who formerly taught pharmacy law at Mercer University and practices in metro Atlanta.
His colleague, Dr. Jonathan Marquess, who owns independent pharmacies and serves as vice president of the Academy of Independent Pharmacy for the state pharmacy association, agreed.
 CDC panel’s actions could decide access to shots

All eyes are on ACIP: the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. It develops policies on vaccination in the United States as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s set to meet Sept. 18 and 19 in Atlanta.
The committee’s policies help govern how pharmacists in Georgia and many other states administer vaccines.
Under Georgia law, if ACIP has approved a vaccine, pharmacists can typically administer it, as long as they have an agreement with a supervising doctor, which most pharmacies do.
If ACIP votes to recommend the Covid vaccine for certain or most populations in the United States, that would allow pharmacists to go back to providing the shots without a prescription, Hamrick said, although how that will work for different age groups and categories of people will depend on the exact details of the new recommendations.
It’s not clear how the committee will vote. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services who has disrupted the vaccine system, dismissed the committee’s 17 members in June and appointed eight of his own picks, seven of whom remain.
Kennedy’s actions have drawn criticism and even lawsuits from professional medical societies, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Medical professionals and public health experts have raised concerns that the committee will curtail its recommendations for the vaccine to only certain populations, stymieing widespread access.
Recently, the Food and Drug Administration approved the latest version of the shot, but with more restrictions on who should get it than last year, raising questions about access. But Georgia pharmacists, and many others, are waiting to see what the ACIP does in September.
“That’s what we’re all waiting on,” Hamrick said.
Marquess, who owns several independent pharmacies in Georgia, said he has ordered the shots and expects them in soon.
In Georgia, as of late last month, about 1.6% of emergency room visits were due to Covid, according to the latest data from the CDC, the highest rate since this time last year. And wastewater Covid levels have ticked up in Georgia from “very low” in mid-July to “moderate” as of late August, according to CDC data.
“Immunizations have been proven to be safe and effective and healthy to keep people [from getting] those terrible diseases,” Marquess said. During the most recent Covid season, from fall 2024 to spring 2025, only about 16% of Georgia adults got at least one shot, according to the CDC.
CVS, which has over 300 pharmacy locations in Georgia, has started receiving the new shots in stores, spokesperson Amy Thibault said. She did not directly answer a question about whether the chain had ordered fewer shots than last year but said it would have “ample supply” to meet the need.
People with a prescription will be able to get the shots at drugstores or at one of the company’s nearly 50 MinuteClinic locations in the state, Thibault said.
Representatives from Publix and Walgreens did not immediately respond to requests for information on how they are handling the shots.
 To be determined: insurance coverage for shots

Marquess said the pharmacists who work for him would typically be willing to put in a quick call to a patient’s doctor to get the needed approval, obviating the need for an office visit.
Thibault of CVS said it would vary by location as to whether pharmacists would call a patient’s doctor for them, or the patient would need to reach out directly.
“It makes it much simpler for the whole medical system if we can utilize our protocol and not call every time to get a prescription,” Marquess said.
Hamrick said it’s unclear how insurers will handle the cost, though they typically cover the shots recommended by ACIP.
The latest Covid vaccine will cost about $225 out-of-pocket at CVS stores, Thibault said.
The updated vaccines are not yet available at county health departments, said Georgia Department of Public Health spokesperson Eric Jens. He said each county’s health department places its own orders, “typically based on need.”
“Covid vaccinations are administered at public health departments by nurses working under protocols established by DPH. DPH does not require a prescription for Covid vaccines,” Jens said. “At this time, DPH does not know what the cost of the updated Covid vaccine will be for individuals without insurance.”
Much of the confusion could be resolved when ACIP meets this month. But turmoil at the CDC, including the ouster of newly appointed Director Susan Monarez and the resignation of four senior officials citing political interference in the vaccine process, could affect the meeting.
U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who cast the deciding vote to confirm Kennedy as HHS secretary, has called on ACIP to “indefinitely delay” its meeting.
“Serious allegations have been made about the meeting agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed,” Cassidy said. “If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership.”
No matter what ACIP does, Georgia pharmacists may have a legal pathway to providing the shots without an individual prescription “under Georgia law pursuant to vaccine protocol agreements,” said Greg Reybold, general counsel and vice president of public policy for the American Pharmacy Cooperative.
Meanwhile, the pharmacists voiced concerns that people are growing tired of hearing about the politics of vaccines and confused by the dizzying array of policy changes.
“We have to untie health care from the politics,” Hamrick said.
“Less outbreaks, less severe complications, less hospitalizations, less death,” Hamrick said. Vaccines “keep people in the population healthier in the long run.”

According to a memo produced by the Missouri Association of County Clerks and Election Authorities, at least two county clerks have been contacted in recent weeks by Andrew McCoy “Mac” Warner, a DOJ official. While serving as attorney general of West Virginia, Warner falsely claimed the CIA and FBI colluded with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to steal the 2020 presidential election from Trump. 
The memo was shared with election officials across the state and obtained by The Independent through a public records request.

Warner requested Jasper County Clerk Charlie Davis and McDonald County Clerk Jessica Cole allow the DOJ to “access, physically inspect and perhaps take physical custody” of election equipment made by Dominion Voting Systems that was used in the November 2020 election, according to the memo. 
In an interview with The Independent, Davis said he informed the DOJ his office purchased new equipment and no longer has the machines used in the 2020 election. But even if he had those machines, Davis said it would be illegal for him to allow anyone access to them. 
“Absolutely not,” he said. “The laws prohibit us from allowing anybody to touch our equipment.”
Davis said he’s not sure why the DOJ wants to access machines used in the 2020 election, which Trump won in Missouri with 57% of the vote. But after the call from the DOJ, Davis said he was also contacted by former Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft urging him to comply with the DOJ request. 
In a statement included in the memo, Cole said custody, maintenance, preparation, testing and storage of election equipment are the responsibility of the local election authority. Allowing unauthorized access, she said, is a crime. 
“These safeguards exist to protect the security, accuracy and integrity of our elections,” she said. 
Livingston County Clerk Sherry Parks, who serves as president of the Missouri Association of County Clerks and Election Authorities, echoed Cole’s point in an email to The Independent, noting that while “robust pre- and post-election equipment testing is open to the public for observation, it is illegal to allow unauthorized access or tampering to election equipment.”
The DOJ did not respond to a request for comment. 
Ashcroft, who in July was appointed by the governor to serve as an administrative law judge, said in a brief interview on Tuesday: “If I were involved, it was a request from someone to help connect people together. And it would have been something that I’d done on my own time, not during work hours. And it would have just been, ‘Hey, do you know someone? Can you give me their number?’ That sort of thing.”
A spokeswoman for Secretary of State Denny Hoskins said in an email to The Independent that Hoskins was contacted by the DOJ hoping to speak with local election officials “for more information and context. Our office referred them to the clerks directly.”
Justice Department demand for state voter lists underscores their importance

In recent months, the DOJ has been contacting states demanding access to sensitive election and voting data. The department has sent letters to at least nine states asking for information related to voter list maintenance in the states under the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act, according to Stateline. 
The focus on Dominion machines harkens back to the web of baseless conspiracy theories spread by Trump supporters in the years following his 2020 defeat that the company was at the heart of a scheme designed to rig the presidential election. 
Those lies about a stolen election helped fuel the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and continue to percolate through Trump’s political base even after he won a second term last year. 
Dominion won a $787.5 million settlement from Fox News in 2023 after the network repeatedly promoted lies that the company’s machines had been used to flip votes away from Trump in an effort to help Biden win the White House.
More recently, right-wing cable channel Newsmax agreed in August to pay Dominion $67 million to settle a libel lawsuit based on similar false claims of election rigging. 
Davis, who still uses Dominion machines, said he knows there are some people who question the integrity of the 2020 election. 
“But it’s been proven, especially here in Jasper County and in the State of Missouri, that our election results are the results of the elections,” he said. “It’s proven that the machines count the ballots correctly.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/080624_Vote1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-02 16:56:55.895681

A new report estimates about 40,000 adults in Greater Boston could face stricter work rules that now extend to age 65 and narrow exemptions for parents.
The post SNAP changes will affect an estimated 40,000 in Greater Boston appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","A NEW FEDERAL LAW could leave 7 percent of Boston-area SNAP recipients with reduced food assistance or new hurdles to qualify, according to a report released Tuesday.
The One Big Beautiful Bill signed by President Donald Trump in July overhauls the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program with stricter work rules, new immigrant eligibility limits and higher state cost-sharing requirements.
An analysis by Boston Indicators estimates about 40,000 adults in Greater Boston could face stricter work rules that now extend to age 65 and narrow exemptions for parents. As of July 2025, nearly 579,000 Greater Boston residents received SNAP, with the highest participation in cities such as Lawrence and Brockton.
Previously, adults ages 18 to 55 without a disability or young children had to work or attend job training 20 hours a week to qualify. Now, parents of children under 14 are exempt, down from under 18, and exemptions for veterans and people experiencing homelessness have been eliminated.
The report said the changes will affect recipients who are “technically able-bodied but face barriers to stable employment, such as inconsistent work hours, caregiving obligations, or limited access to training programs.”
Of those facing new requirements, about 31,000 live in childless households and another 11,000 in families with teenagers.
The impact is expected to fall more heavily on white residents, who make up the largest share of older SNAP clients. Roughly 18,000 white adults could be affected by the new age rules. Latino households may also be disproportionately hit, with about 5,000 adults projected to lose eligibility under the narrowed parenting exemption.
The federal law also eliminates eligibility for about 9,600 legally present immigrants with humanitarian status in the Boston area, including refugees and trafficking victims, according to the report.
The changes at the federal level mean state lawmakers have to decide whether to come up with a new plan to help SNAP recipients or let them cope on their own with the new federal rules.

School leaders kept it quiet.,Tim Carpenter,,,,,https://kansasreflector.com/2025/09/02/a-kansas-student-reported-her-coach-for-harassment-and-touching-school-leaders-kept-it-quiet/,A student's allegation of sexual harassment against a Kansas superintendent raises alarms about safety of children and risk of districts awash in secrecy.,"Comanche County School District Superintendent Ty Theurer, photographed with the 2019 graduating class at South Central High School in Coldwater, is under investigation for alleged sexual harassment of a student. He was serving as golf coach this spring, according to the student's complaint, when he told her to hold golf clubs as if she was grasping a penis. (Comanche County School District)COLDWATER — After the father of a small-town, southwest Kansas high school junior reported his daughter was the victim of sexual harassment and unwanted touching by her golf coach, he met with the coach and principal to lay out the teenager’s concerns and disgust.
By the end of that meeting in May, the father said, the three men seemed to have an understanding that the coach violated policy — if not the law — when he made a stunning comment to the girl during golf practice: He told her to grip a club like it was a penis.
At the meeting, the coach and principal signed a document affirming he directed lurid comments at the girl, according to a copy of the document obtained by Kansas Reflector. The student confirmed the accusations in a report with law enforcement and in an interview with Kansas Reflector.
The document said the coach on multiple occasions grabbed the student’s hips, waist and shoulders while standing behind her. She also said that he held the back of her thigh, purportedly to improve her golf posture.
Ty Theurer eventually resigned as the South Central High School golf coach, which was his part-time assignment in the Comanche County School District. He didn’t surrender a much more influential position in the district: Superintendent.
Kansas Reflector interviews with students, parents, educators and elected officials tied to Comanche County schools revealed a concerted effort by insiders to shield the district’s top administrator, despite ongoing law enforcement and Title IX investigations. People with knowledge of Theurer’s past said the golf practice incident wasn’t the only example of inappropriate behavior by the superintendent, who for years personally controlled how the district responded to alleged sexual harassment.
Kansas Reflector reporting shows the Comanche County school board president and vice president along with the high school principal collaborated to minimize disciplinary action against Theurer. It indicated the president sought to tamp down scrutiny of the superintendent as word of the student’s allegation made its way through the sparsely populated district.
In a brief interview with Kansas Reflector, Theurer declined to respond to questions about the complaint.
“I’m not going to answer any of those questions,” he said. “I am under investigation. I’m not allowed to speak about it.”

‘A little bold’
The student who Theurer made the salacious comments to said she had been standing near him at a the Coldwater golf course during practice this spring, according to a Comanche County Sheriff’s Office report and an interview with Kansas Reflector. The student said Theurer approached her and said, “OK, now I’m going to be a little bold.”
She said he moved closer to her and whispered details of how he expected her to hold golf clubs. She quoted him: “I want you to imagine you have a penis.”
When the student responded with alarm to Theurer’s remark, she said, the superintendent cupped his hands around his groin, saying, “Just like this.”
Her description for law enforcement and Kansas Reflector also said the superintendent “ran his hand against the back of my neck and slowly moved me forward to help me with my putting position.” The summary said Theurer grabbed the back of her thigh as he urged her to bend her knees.
The student’s parents requested anonymity in this story to protect the privacy of their teenage daughter. Kansas Reflector and its parent organization, States Newsroom, do not identify survivors of sexual abuse.
In May, the student’s father reported the behavior to Andy Uhl, the Comanche County school board’s vice president. Uhl apparently passed the dad’s complaint up the chain of command. That resulted in the father’s meeting with Theurer and South Central High School principal Bud Valerius.
But instead of all seven members of the school board assuming a role in a personnel issue involving the person hired by the board to serve as superintendent, Valerius dealt with the student’s complaint as if it were a clash between coach and athlete, emails show. Valerius took that approach despite conflicts of interest, including his job as a direct subordinate of Theurer, his assignment as assistant golf coach and his friendship with Theurer.
School board president Kelly Herd said in an email to other board members that in her opinion, “There was nothing in the complaint that would warrant administrative leave” for superintendent Theurer. Instead, she told board members, coach Theurer had been given a “warning” to not offend again.
The school board replaced the superintendent as the district’s Title IX coordinator with oversight of sexual harassment or sex discrimination complaints because it would be improper for Theurer to investigate himself. Those duties were passed several months ago to the district’s elementary school principal, who would be expected initiate an investigation of the superintendent.

‘Nothing has been handled right’
Dean Yoder is another member of the Comanche County school board, which governs the education of the 300 students near the Oklahoma boarder. Besides Coldwater, the district draws students from communities including Protection, Wilmore and Buttermilk. The district extends into Kiowa and Clark counties.
A majority of the school board was excluded at the outset from the process of dealing with the leadership crisis, Yoder said.
The school board president ordered him to “stand down,” Yoder said, and she argued the controversy involving Theurer had to be resolved quietly.
“Nothing has been handled right,” Yoder said.
Bill Faflick, executive director of the Kansas State High School Activities Association, said he wasn’t aware of the controversy in Comanche County schools before being contacted by Kansas Reflector.
He said the student who made the complaint should know she could have done nothing to warrant harassment by a school administrator. Assuming the complaint was proven, he said, the incident would make “every dad shudder.”
“If true, certainly that’s inappropriate. It’s wrong as wrong can be. There’s no place for that in school sports,” said Faflick, who worked for 30 years in administrative roles in Wichita public schools.
Herd, the school board president, appeared to shield information about the case from the full school board. In a video obtained by Kansas Reflector, Herd abruptly adjourned a June board meeting to circumvent discussion of Theurer’s conduct. She ordered her colleagues to stop speaking with community members about the controversy.
Herd resisted pleas, including from the golf athlete’s parents, to convene a special meeting so the board could learn more about the allegations and investigatory process, and weigh potential disciplinary options.
Since May, the board president sent a series of emails about the Theurer controversy to fellow board members. In that correspondence, Herd said she and the board’s vice president, in conjunction with high school principal, dealt effectively with the sexual harassment complaint. Herd said “normal procedure” was followed.
Herd, who didn’t respond to Kansas Reflector requests for comment, said in an email to the board that the complaint ought to be viewed as a teachable moment for a coach rather than a leadership disaster centered on a district superintendent.
“As with any other HS coach, Bud (Valerius, high school principal) is the one to handle these issues. All coaches are given a warning and this will be considered (Theurer’s),” Herd’s email to board members said. “Bud called me and Andy (Uhl) to update us. We both agreed it has been addressed and handled. I assure you this was not taken lightly and it was not brushed aside.”
In another email, the board president instructed her elected peers to cooperate with her goal of limiting public knowledge of Theurer’s plight.
“This conversation regarding Ty has gotten far out of control in our community. We as board members must be careful to not continue to fuel the fire,” Herd wrote. “He has been written up and it is in his personnel file. He did not deny nor make excuses.”
 
Ongoing investigations
The student’s parents, frustrated school board leadership hadn’t moved to guarantee student safety, filed a report with local law enforcement. Comanche County authorities referred the case of alleged battery to the Ford County Sheriff’s Office.
The school board’s president and the student’s parents said the sexual harassment complaint presented to the school district was forwarded to the Kansas Association of School Boards, which advises school boards on compliance with federal Title IX law. A representative of KASB has interviewed students and others associated within the school district regarding Theurer.
School board members expect to be briefed in executive session on the report, the school board president said.
Eventually, the school board association’s draft report must be shared with the superintendent and complainant. A “decision-maker,” potentially an independent hearing officer, would examine evidence and make a determination about whether harassment occurred. Both sides could appeal.
In a recent email to board members, Herd recommended board members fend off any reporter asking questions about Theurer by explaining they were unable to comment.
“I am not keeping secrets. Nor am I acting on my own,” the school board president said.

‘Creeps me out’
South Central High School graduate Isabel Hackney said in an interview with Kansas Reflector that Theurer’s objectionable pronouncements to students extended beyond the golf course.
Hackney said she accidentally collided with a male friend at the school in October 2024, and it was caught on security video. She and some other students decided to watch the footage in the high school’s administration office.
While they were watching, she said, the superintendent emerged from his office. Theurer asked to repeatedly watch the clip, Hackney said.
“Then he said, ‘Izzy, you just got teabagged,’ ” Hackney said, repeating slang for putting a scrotum near a face. “From then on, I felt honestly scared to be around Mr. Theurer.”
Emily Hackney, Isabel’s mother, subsequently confronted Theurer outside the high school about his remark. She told the superintendent it was wrong to speak to her daughter that way.
“He was trying to ignore me,” Emily Hackney said. “He tried to deny it.”
Klete Hackney, Isabel’s father, said his daughter feared retaliation if the family complained to anyone involved with the school district. Instead, Isabel refused to shake the superintendent’s hand at graduation this spring.
“She did it for herself and she did it for all the kids,” Klete Hackney said.
 
Upcoming board meeting
An attempt could be made during the school board’s meeting Wednesday evening at South Central High School to compel a vote by the seven-member board on a motion to place Theurer on administrative leave.
“If you don’t know anything about it, it’s because that’s the plan — sweep it under the rug and nobody will ever know,” said Zach Ellis, who has two children at the high school.
Ellis said he signed up to speak at the next school board meeting, but he’s not certain the board would allow him to say what he wanted to say. On social media, Ellis encouraged people with ties to the school district to join him at the meeting.
He said the school board by now should have adopted new policies or procedures designed to deter sexual harassment. It was “absolutely ridiculous” the school board allowed a superintendent under investigation for sexual harassment and battery to run the district, he said.
“I’ve got a daughter who is a junior. I’m all about making sure that her safety is protected,” Ellis said. “She avoids him. Her words not mine: ‘He creeps me out, so I avoid him.’ ”
 
‘Admit his guilt’
The student’s father said the principal read aloud the one-page document during their meeting in May. Theurer and Valerius agreed the signing confirmed they discussed the memo. The superintendent didn’t challenge the student’s recollections at the time, the father said.
“I said, ‘I’m not leaving this office without some documentation that this conversation happened,'” the father said. “That’s when the principal said, ‘Hey, we can all sign it here. He can sign it to admit his guilt.’ ”
In an interview, the student said that when she joined the high school’s golf team, other girls warned her to “be careful, Ty’s a little weird.”
“My first day we were in a line,” she said. “He came up behind me and placed his hands on my hips. I wasn’t asked if that was OK. Whenever I asked the golf girls … ‘Hey, does he do this a lot?’ And they’re, like, ‘Yeah, you’ll get used to it.’ ”
She quit the team after the superintendent made the penis remark.
 
‘How could this not be a priority?’
In June, the student’s parents attended a regularly scheduled Comanche County school board meeting with the goal of sharing information about what their daughter said she endured while coached by Theurer.
Herd, the board president, called the mother before the meeting in an attempt to dissuade her from making public comments about the superintendent, the mother said.
The mother decided to go to the board meeting. She attempted to read from a written statement. Herd cut her off by adjourning the meeting. A video obtained by Kansas Reflector showed Herd and other board members walking out of the room with the mother still reading from her prepared remarks.
“How could this not be a priority? Not for my family alone, but for the school community?” the mother said in an interview. “The sudden adjournment and insistence that such an issue of import was literally worth walking out on is deeply troubling.”
She said the school board president’s attempt to bury the complaint was “completely unacceptable” and risked the health and safety of students in the district’s three schools.

(Photo courtesy of Maine Family Planning)Maine’s largest reproductive health care provider is continuing its fight in federal court to reinstate lost Medicaid funding.
Maine Family Planning, which serves more than 8,000 patients, half of whom are on Medicaid, lost up to $1.9 million in federal reimbursements after the federal budget reconciliation bill was signed into law on July 4. 
Certain reproductive health care providers — including Maine Family Planning and Planned Parenthood clinics in Maine — were blocked by a provision in the law from accepting Medicaid funding.
Planned Parenthood challenged the provision in federal court and succeeded in temporarily blocking it from applying to the organization. In late August, Maine Family Planning made a similar case, appealing to Judge Lance Walker, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in his first term. Walker rejected Maine Family Planning’s request for a preliminary injunction on August 25.
The health care provider did not demonstrate the irreparable harm it claimed to face, Walker wrote in his decision. He also acknowledged that after the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion, Maine Family Planning and other providers knew about the increased risk that they could lose federal funding if they continued to provide abortions and that the provider still “stood firm in its mission.” 
On Friday, Maine Family Planning, represented by national legal advocacy firm the Center for Reproductive Rights, appealed Walker’s decision in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, asking for a decision by Sept. 8.
If the appeals court does not grant the injunction “within a matter of weeks, MFP will have to discharge all of its existing primary care patients and wind down its primary care practice,” attorney Meetra Mehdizadeh wrote in the latest filing.
“Soon after, MFP may have to discharge family planning patients on Medicaid as well.”
Maine Family Planning’s services include primary care, STI testing, and cancer screenings. While the provider offers abortions, it does not use Medicaid funds, as the Hyde Amendment already bans use of federal reimbursements to fund abortions. However, Mehdizadeh made the case that the organization is collateral damage in the federal government’s attempt to defund Planned Parenthood.
 “If Congress’s goal was to generally reduce the number of abortions … it is irrational to achieve that goal by imposing exacting criteria that only apply to a tiny subset of abortion providers nationwide, treating them differently from all other ‘similarly situated’ providers,” she wrote.
Granting the injunction would not harm the defendants, she argued, but would cause lasting damage for patients and Maine Family Planning’s reputation — “damage that cannot be easily undone even if Medicaid funding is eventually restored.”

(Photo: Colleen Pegar / Hill County Extension).Palmer amaranth, a weed agricultural interests are desperately trying to prevent becoming established in Montana, was found last month near a grain silo in Hill County.
Agricultural groups, including those working at Montana State University Extension, have been closely tracking the weed, which is notably resistant to herbicides. There have been four reported confirmed instances of Palmer amaranth in Montana, though researchers say there isn’t a known established distribution in the state. The site is being monitored by the MSU Extension office.
The weed, while native to North America, doesn’t have a foothold in Montana. It spreads quickly and can choke out crops — it can decrease crop yields by 80 to 90% if left unchecked, according to a report in the New York Times. If it becomes established, the potential economic impact could be severe, according to MSU Extension’s agricultural department.
Herbicide resistant weeds are a “huge” issue in Montana, said Tim Seipel, a Cropland Weed Specialist with MSU Extension. Palmer amaranth is a pigweed with long, thin flower heads when compared to its more common relatives, such as redroot pigweed.
“If it really spreads out in crop fields in Montana, especially in our pulse crop industry and pulse fields — so lentils, chickpeas, beets — it would cost us millions of dollars, probably in additional herbicide input costs,” Seipel said. “So that’s why we’re trying to really be on top of it and keep it contained.”
One peer-reviewed study published in Frontiers in Plant Science found Palmer amaranth resistant to six different herbicide brands. The plant has found ways to adapt to human-created herbicides and is essentially outpacing science. It’s hard to kill — plants pulled out of the ground have been known to reestablish themselves and the plant itself can grow three inches in a day.

“When you have a species like Palmer Amaranth that has evolved resistance to many of our known herbicide modes of action, the way the herbicide kills the plant, what it does to the plant, you begin to have to stack modes of action on top of each other,” Seipel said. “You have to choose modes of action that may be still under patent. There’s no generic, you’re buying more complex tank mixes.”
What this means for farmers, Seipel said, is higher costs for weed control and lower prices for their products. Crops harvested in fields containing many green weeds also are stained by them, which means lower prices when farmers sell.
“You take it to the elevator and you sell it, you get docked economically for stained lentils,” Seipel said. “So you don’t get paid.”
Precipitation this summer, described as “abundant” in a press release discussing the weed, could be to blame for the plant taking root. Sepiel said the Palmer amaranth was found in a field following harvesting from what’s called a “custom cutter” or a company that follows ripening wheat through multiple states, harvesting it for producers.
Palmer amaranth is native to the American southwest and began seriously competing with cotton in the 1990s. It’s since moved to the Midwest and Mid-south.
The weed is not the only troublesome one in Montana. The MSU Extension Office also lists Kochia scoparia, a broadleaf weed, as a major threat to Montana as well because of how difficult to control it is.
These weeds can move via harvesters, trains – even birdseed, Seipel said. Recently, Palmer amaranth was found in Spokane County (Washington). It was tracked back to contaminated birdseed bought at a Safeway.
The first recorded palmer amaranth sighting in Montana? Also traced back to bird feed.
“Bird feed, kind of dirty stuff,” Spiel noted. “Has lots of weeds in it.”
The Extension office asked anyone who sees Palmer amaranth to contact them immediately. Much like invasive species work, quick responses can tamp down an issue before it spreads.
“Everyone’s heads are up and they’re looking for it. We found three plants so far, and none of them have made seed in the field so far,” Seipel said. “We’ve gotten them out early enough because they’re not quite adapted to Montana’s conditions yet. So the more we do that, the more we can keep it under wraps.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Palmer2.jpg,,,2025-09-02 15:57:57.920619

In a news release, Gov. Jeff Landry’s office said the facility “will house the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens arrested by ICE.”
Landry declared a state emergency in late July to allow the expedited repair of Camp J at Angola. The section, which has been closed since 2018, consists of four maximum-security buildings on the 18,000-acre prison grounds. At its peak, the camp held more than 400 prisoners. The state has not said what its capacity would be after renovations. 
Once known as the “Dungeon,” most of Camp J had been designated as solitary confinement to segregate prisoners for disciplinary reasons. Corrections officials closed it seven years ago after its cell locks malfunctioned, allowing inmates to evade security checks. Dozens of weapons were discovered after its closure, and more than 80 prison employees quit, retired or were fired related to misconduct at Camp J.
Other than being a quarantine zone for prisoners during the COVID-19 pandemic, Camp J has not been in use. 
Landry’s emergency order suspended state procurement code and public bid law for the state to secure any materials and write or amend any contracts needed to respond to the emergency. The cost of Camp J’s refurbishment has not yet been made public. 
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Deputy ICE Director Madison Sheahan will join the governor at Angola Wednesday morning to make the announcement official. 
Aside from its state penitentiary, Louisiana has become a go-to location for the Trump administration since it placed a heightened emphasis on immigration enforcement in January. The state’s nine ICE processing and detentions centers have a combined capacity of 6,000 people, second only to Texas with more than 28,000.
Louisiana State Penitentiary has room to hold more than 6,000 incarcerated people. Its population was 4,253 as of June 30, according to the most recent statistics from the Louisiana Department of Corrections and Public Safety. 
Immigrant rights advocates say the Louisiana ICE facilities have been full for several months because Bondi and the U.S. Department of Justice consider federal courts in the South to be more friendly venues for its immigration cases. 
According to data analysis from the Deportation Data Project, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested 1,989 people in Louisiana from when Trump returned to office Jan. 20 through June 26. More than half of those arrestees have since been deported or removed from the United States.
The analysis also found that just 6% of ICE arrests in Louisiana over the period were convicted violent criminals.        
Critics of the Trump administration’s approach to immigration have called on federal courts to uphold the U.S. Constitution’s requirement of due process for persons who are arrested. They note the vast majority of immigrant detainees have not been allowed to post bail while awaiting trial and are therefore unable to build their defense and secure witnesses. 
This is a developing story.

Ned Lamont named Susan Hamilton, general counsel and a former commissioner of the state Department of Children and Families, as the agency’s interim commissioner on Tuesday.
Her predecessor, Jodi Hill-Lilly, left the department Monday after less than two years as its leader.
Hamilton served as commissioner of DCF from 2007 to 2011 under Gov. M. Jodi Rell. During that time, the agency saw some slippage in progress toward meeting children’s basic service needs, according to reports. 
Lamont cited Hamilton’s long career at DCF, first as a social worker and later as commissioner, as preparation to return to the role. The agency is charged with the care of thousands of children in foster care and oversees programming to support kids’ mental health needs.
“She returned two years ago to serve as general counsel, and her extensive experience makes her ready to immediately step back into the role as commissioner for a second stint,” Lamont’s statement said. “The services DCF provides — safeguarding some of the most vulnerable youths in our state — are among the most important in government, and it is a function whose work never stops.”
Hamilton, who will be the third person to serve as the head of DCF during the Lamont administration, thanked the governor for selecting her for the position.
“I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to serve again as the DCF commissioner to help lead an incredible and dedicated team who work tirelessly to promote the safety, permanency, and well-being of Connecticut’s children and families,” Hamilton said in a statement. 
The Center for Children’s Advocacy released a statement in support of Hamilton, saying that its attorneys have long worked cooperatively during her years of work in the state. 
“We appreciate her willingness to serve as interim DCF Commissioner during these challenging times,” the organization said in its statement. “Connecticut’s child welfare system continues to confront urgent challenges, including the most serious behavioral health crisis and human service gaps the state has dealt with in many years. We know Sue will continue her longstanding partnership with child welfare stakeholders to strategically address these challenges in the days and weeks ahead.”
Hamilton’s initial tenure as DCF commissioner took place while the agency was under the supervision of a court monitor.
The court monitor was assigned as part of a 1989 federal civil rights lawsuit on behalf of “Juan F.,” an anonymous 10-year-old boy representative of a class of children whose needs were unmet by an agency run with poor resources, guided by outdated policies.
The court monitor issued regular reports on the agency’s progress toward reform until DCF was released from the order in 2022.
A 2009 report from the monitor found that nearly half of the children in DCF care weren’t having their basic service needs met, and that the state was losing ground in its court-assigned reforms. The agency saw a drop in the percentage of children who were reunified with their parents from about 72% of cases studies to 56%, according to Children’s Rights, Inc. The group noted that DCF was meeting 15 of the 22 indicators for success, after previously meeting 17 of 22, marking “the state’s worst performance since Susan Hamilton was appointed commissioner of DCF in June 2007.”
Ken Mysogland, bureau chief of external affairs, said during the more than 30 years of the consent decree, it was common for there to be progress and slippage on the goals under various commissioners.
“Throughout every commissioner’s tenure, compliance with the outcome measures may have increased or may have decreased in particular measures due to many factors. Those include budgetary considerations, political implications, the impact of particular societal pressures on families and the emerging nature of risks that our families face,” Mysogland said. ” … At the end of her tenure, the department was in substantial compliance and sustained compliance with all but two of the outcomes.”
In 2009, Hamilton was also arrested and charged with driving under the influence. She participated in a diversionary program that erased the charge from her record.
Committee on Children co-chair Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford, said he looks forward to working with Hamilton and hopes to support her in “stabilizing the agency” and supporting kids and families.
Paris said because DCF deals with sensitive issues, it’s often open to criticism and that the blame for the agency’s challenges can’t be put on any one person.
“I think the agency has always been under challenges, and I think it’s just by nature of the agency that we’re talking about and what we’re dealing with,” he said.
Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton, the Committee on Children’s other co-chair, said she welcomes Hamilton to the role. “As we look forward to the future of DCF my hope is that children’s welfare will also include a commitment to behavioral health support for all our children to best serve them now and in the future,” Maher wrote to the Connecticut Mirror. “I look forward to working with Commissioner Hamilton in the months ahead.”
Children’s Committee ranking member Rep. Anne Dauphinais, R-Killingly also issued a statement in support of Hamilton.
“With Susan Hamilton stepping in as interim commissioner, my hope is DCF enters this transition maintaining some stability,” Dauphinais’ statement said. “Her experience and appreciation for the department will hopefully improve services while Governor Lamont decides on a permanent successor to focus on what matters most—Connecticut’s children and families.”
Hamilton earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology and justice studies from the University of New Hampshire, a Master of Social Work degree from the University of Connecticut School of Social Work, and a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Connecticut School of Law, according to Lamont’s office.
Hill-Lilly, the previous commissioner, earned about $250,000 annually, and Hamilton currently earns about $211,000, according to state records.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_0812_SR_DCFMeeting_003-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-02 15:57:57.920619

In Connecticut, the money was used to fund infrastructure upgrades, schools, nonprofits and more.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Mark Pazniokas to discuss his article, “How easy COVID money whet CT lawmakers’ appetites for more,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Mark’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Mark. There’s an ongoing investigation into alleged misappropriation of state grants to nonprofits in Hartford, and that’s what prompted you to do this deep dive into lawmaker earmarks in Hartford. So let’s start with the FBI investigation into Hartford State Senator Doug McCrory’s role in steering the COVID relief money to the nonprofits there.
MP: Yes. So what we know about it really stems from the release and response to Freedom of Information requests from the Connecticut Mirror and others that disclose documents that were subpoenaed from the state government. So those subpoenas were public information. The Lamont Administration released them, and the focus there is on Senator McCrory’s relationship with a woman who runs a nonprofit and also consults for other nonprofits. They appear to be looking at whether or not there was any undue influence. But again, we have to be careful here, because we know what records they’re looking at, but we don’t have any precise allegations of wrongdoing; they are looking at the Senator’s relationship with any number of nonprofits in Hartford, the district he serves, which is North Hartford, Windsor and Bloomfield.
WSHU: Now, let’s talk about the role of lawmakers in actually getting these projects funded through earmarks. What is an earmark, and how does that work?
MP: Earmark, you know, it’s known by other terms. You know, people would call it pork barrel spending. This is really something that is as old as politics, the idea of a legislator, whether it’s in the Connecticut General Assembly or in Congress, of directing funding towards something in their district. This fell out of favor in Congress — in 2011, they actually banned earmarks, and then they recently brought them back with some significant reforms, and those are reforms that we don’t see in Connecticut. They are, namely, a member of Congress who is trying to direct federal funding to a particular recipient, which is disclosed. They have to own it. And that is very different from how it works in the Connecticut General Assembly. It’s a very fuzzy process. It really relies on a lawmaker’s good relationship with the House’s leadership and the Democratic majority leaders.
WSHU: The Democratic leaders are in charge of a lot of this money now, but in the past, we’ve had a divided government in Connecticut, and we still had this issue of earmarks.
MP: Yes, earmarks are not unique to the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party was my focus because they control the governor’s office in both chambers of the General Assembly, and that’s where the money is going to the districts of Democratic lawmakers by and large. Now we should say many of the recipients are well-established nonprofits, as well as some municipal governments, so there is nothing scandalous on its face about this money going to those recipients. But the question is, there’s very little oversight. The whole process is opaque on the surface; we don’t know who the lawmaker is who actually directed this money.
WSHU: In the federal legislation, lawmakers must list all the specific earmarks.
MP: Correct. That is correct, and that is a major difference between how it’s done in Washington and how it’s done in Hartford. Because of the FBI investigation, I think you’re going to see a debate next year about how earmarks should be done. You know, the other element here is, after the Great Recession of 2008, the General Assembly really did not have a lot of money to spread around in this way. So this, this kind of stuff, dried up. And then with COVID and the American Rescue Plan Act, ARPA, there was a lot of money flowing in here, and all of a sudden, they had money to dispose of. It was discretion. A lot of it was discretionary money, and there was a hard deadline.
WSHU: So they had to spend it immediately or lose it, right?
MP: Absolutely. And it’s quite clear that, you know, appetites were whetted by the ARPA money that came in. And so we saw a difference in the last two state budgets. There was a lot of vetting in the Department of Economic and Community Development, which runs some very competitive grant programs. There was also a quote, various grant line items in the budget, and it doubled from the last biennial budget to this one.
WSHU: So, how much is in it now?
MP: Over the two-year budget, it’s now about $39 million. So that’s over two years, and that is slightly more than double what it was in the previous two-year budget. So Cathy Austin, the state Senator who is the co-chair of the Appropriations Committee, said, look, there’s no question what was going on here. The ARPA money puts people in a frame of mind to keep doing local earmarks, and that’s why this is sort of blowing up. So, there’s a bunch of things happening here at once, which is why I thought it was a good idea to take a look at how earmarks work in Connecticut.
WSHU: Okay, so, how is it working? You spoke with Matt Ritter, the speaker.
MP: Who was very, very honest about the dynamics. I mean, he said what we know, but people rarely say, which is, yeah, from time to time, you know, you help a member of your caucus who has some trouble back home, perhaps with a tough race, so you help that person bring home some money. In the old days, we hadn’t seen this in a long time, but when there were real fights for the speakership and other leadership posts, earmarks would be spread around that way to, you know, get people to support your candidacy for speaker; that is not the case here.
WSHU: Politics does play a role in determining.
MP: Yes, it does. So what are the relationships with your leadership? But again, there’s not a lot of transparency there. The other thing that I wrote about it, which is kind of interesting, is that the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus has its own pool of money, and each member of that caucus gets to earmark $150,000 to an organization in their district. And this is a deal that was cut after the Sandy Hook shooting. This was sort of a side agreement, because there was such a focus, understandably, on the murders of those 20 children and six educators. But you know, you had urban lawmakers who pointed out that the body count, quite frankly, in some of their cities was higher, but without making news, it would be one here, one there. What came out of that were two grant programs addressing youth services and youth violence protection, and it is really up to the Black and Puerto Rican caucus to distribute that money.
WSHU: But the money does go to a youth program run by the University of New Haven.
MP: Well, the evaluation was done by the Tow Institute in concert with the University of New Haven. So, the people are active in the Black and Puerto Rican caucus, particularly Toni Walker, who is the co-chair of the other appropriations. She points out that their earmarks, their programs come with some training from the Tow Institute and University of New Haven and some evaluations, because they’re really not detailed evaluations of the efficacy of these various groups. You might have to submit an annual report that shows activities, but there is no measure of how effective they are. The Black and Puerto Rican caucus actually has contracted again with this Institute and the University of New Haven to really try to do that feedback to see what works. What are the good metrics that would measure the efficacy of these programs?
WSHU: What are the Republicans saying about all this?
MP: Well, Tammy Nuccio is the ranking Republican on appropriations. You know, she just said, Look, this is asinine that there, particularly, I’m talking about the various grant line items in the Department of Economic and Community Development, where there are no standards. And she just says, This is crazy. There is no vetting. And Vinny Candelora, the House Minority Leader, makes a similar comment. And really, it’s hard to push back at that, because at least in the case of the various grant line items, there are not a lot of standards. One of the senior officials at the ECD, that department, makes it clear that this program comes without any parameters as to who can get the money. The legislature says, give them the money. They cut a contract, and at the end of the year, they make sure it was spent, and they get a kind of minimalist report as to what they did with it.
WSHU: Wow. This is an issue that is very likely to come up in the next session, right?
MP: Matt Ritter, the speaker, certainly thinks so. There’s nothing like a federal criminal investigation. What are the standards for how money’s going out the door? And again, I want to be careful and not sort of, you know, smear all the recipients, because, again, many of these are well-established nonprofits, but some are new, and some of them, you don’t really have a lot of detail about what you’re getting for the money. It’s really spreading money around. And, you know, there are things like Little Leagues that get the money, which I think everybody likes the Little League. But the question is, is that really the best use of state funds? It’s a real broad mix of what the money is used for.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0107_SR_CapitolMugs_064-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-02 16:56:55.895681

(Photo by Bear Gulch Fire 2025 via Facebook)Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities last week raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.
Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.
Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.
The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.
“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”
Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.
One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.
“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”
Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.
Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.
After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.
After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.
“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”
In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.
Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.
“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”
After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.
The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.
Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.
A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.
The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.
“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.
Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.
The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.
Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.
One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.
The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.
“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”
Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.
“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.
On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.
“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”
Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.
“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”
Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.
“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”
In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.

Congressional committee to discuss Great American Outdoors Act, which provided money to preserve the Kelly Parcel. That revenue stream may be in danger.
The post Hageman to hear testimony on public land funding in Teton Park appeared first on WyoFile .","A Congressional panel will hear testimony in Grand Teton National Park on Friday about the 2020 Great American Outdoors Act amid worries Republicans might cut a line of funding to expand public parkland. 
Congress and the Trump administration have already fired public land agency staff and sought to sell Western public land for development while at the same time boosting logging, drilling, mining and new road-building.
U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman is scheduled to attend the field hearing of the Committee on Natural Resources at Jenny Lake. 
Signed into law by President Trump in August 2020, the GAOA provides two distinct funding channels. One is dedicated to maintenance backlogs and the other is earmarked to create new parkland, including everything from small-town ball diamonds to places like the sensitive Kelly Parcel. The funds benefit public land agencies in the Department of Interior and Department of Agriculture.

The act provides up to $1.9 billion a year for deferred maintenance. The act also permanently provides $900 million annually to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the account that enabled the government to buy the Kelly Parcel wildlife migration crossroad in Grand Teton.
Public land advocates worry the act’s conservation fund is in jeopardy.
“The Land and Water Conservation Fund is a question,” said Rob Wallace, a former high-ranking official with the U.S. Department of the Interior. As an independent citizen, he played a key role in the preservation of the square-mile Kelly Parcel last year.
“The administration says they support the deferred-maintenance piece,” he said. “That’s at least halfway there. I think there’s a very good chance the act will be reauthorized, at least for the deferred maintenance.”
Reauthorization and reform
The committee subtitled the hearing “Modernizing and Maintaining National Parks to Celebrate America’s 250th Birthday.”
“The hearing will examine opportunities to reauthorize and reform the Great American Outdoors Act to enhance public access, improve infrastructure, and create new outdoor recreation opportunities at our national parks,” the committee’s notice reads. The notice does not mention the other agencies — U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs — that also benefit from the act. Nor does the notice refer to the conservation fund.
The hearing is scheduled to be live streamed and to include testimony from Leslie Mattson, president of the Grand Teton National Park Foundation. That nonprofit raised $37.6 million to enable the Kelly Parcel conservation purchase, preventing potential development as luxury real estate. (Wyoming, which owned the school section, demanded $100 million, but federal law prohibited the federal government from paying more than the appraised value.)
Chip Jenkins, Grand Teton National Park superintendent, is also on the witness list, along with Julie Calder, Jackson Hole Travel and Tourism Board vice president. Taylor Phillips, Jackson Hole Ecotours founder, and Kristen Brengel, National Parks Conservation Association senior vice president, are also on the agenda.
Many Wyoming politicians have been tepid, if not hostile, toward conservation of federal public land. The American people own about 48% of Wyoming, mainly through the U.S. Forest Service, the BLM and the National Park Service.
Both Wyoming’s Republican Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis voted against the GAOA in 2020.

Hageman signed on as a friend of Utah when that state petitioned the Supreme Court last year to take over, own and control 18.5 million acres of BLM land — property owned by all Americans — in the Beehive State. She likened federal ownership to a casus belli — a case for war.
“[T]he federal government’s actions would amount to an invasion and conquest of that land [in Utah] if … Utah were a separate sovereign nation,” she argued in the unsuccessful pleading before the high court.
Public land advocates will offer their take on the politics of public lands in the West at a forum in Jackson, the day before the field hearings. At 1 p.m. Thursday, a coalition of conservation groups will bring the Keep Parks Public road tour to the Teton County Library.
The public forum will be the sixth stop in five Western states since the road tour began in mid-August. The forum features Peggie DePasquale, a Bridger-Teton National Forest ranger fired during the Trump administration’s recent purge of federal employees. She now works with the Wyoming Wilderness Association.
Jenny Fitzgerald, executive director of the Jackson Hole Conservation Alliance, and Lauren Bogard, a senior director at the Center for Western Priorities, will be among the speakers.

Joni Ernst announced Tuesday she is officially not running for another term in the U.S. Senate, leaving the seat open heading into the 2026 election cycle.
In a video address, Ernst said it was “no easy decision” to decide not to seek reelection for a third term as senator.
“It has been an honor to dedicate my life to the service of our great state and country, having been raised in a family who has given me so much love and support,” Ernst said. “Now, as our family ages and grows, it’s my time for me to give back to them. After a tremendous amount of prayer and reflection, I will not be seeking reelection in 2026.”
Ernst, who was first elected in 2014 and reelected in 2020, is the first female combat veteran elected to the U.S. Senate, having served in the U.S. Army Reserves and Iowa Army National Guard. Before her time in Congress, she had served in public office as a state senator and Montgomery County auditor.

The Republican said Iowans sent her to Washington “with a mission in mind — to make Washington squeal,” referencing her 2014 campaign ad and efforts in office to address federal government waste, fraud and abuse. Ernst said she was “proud to say we have delivered” on her “squeal” promises. She also highlighted her work in the U.S. Senate on anti-abortion measures, preventing violence against women and supporting farmers and veterans.
“As a proud Harley rider, you can rest assured, I’m not slowing down anytime soon,” Ernst said. “There is still so much to accomplish before the end of my term, and I’ll keep fighting every single day, as I always have, to make Iowans’ voices heard loud and clear in the halls of Congress.”
Reports were published Friday from multiple outlets saying that sources close to Ernst expected she would announce her plans for 2026 this week. Though Senate GOP leadership had reportedly encouraged Ernst to run for another term, the senator faced criticism from Republicans for expressing concerns about U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth during the nomination process. She also gained national attention for saying “well, we all are going to die,” at a May town hall when responding to a person who said GOP-backed Medicaid cuts would cause people to die.
Democrats running for the U.S. Senate seat in the 2026 election, responded that Ernst’s decision not to run was a signal that Republicans’ hold of Iowa’s congressional seats could be at risk. Currently, Iowa’s federal delegation is all Republican, but Iowa’s 1st and 3rd Districts have been brought up by political forecasters as pivotal battlegrounds for control of the U.S. House in the upcoming midterms.
The Cook Political Report rated the race for Iowa’s Senate seat as “likely Republican” — but the race could be more contentious without an incumbent Republican candidate.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) Chair Kirsten Gillibrand released a statement responding to Ernst’s announcement, and said her decision shows that “Donald Trump and Senate Republicans’ devastating agenda has put their majority in jeopardy.”
“Republicans can see the writing on the wall: spiking costs and ripping away health care does so much damage to their states that they would rather leave the Senate than defend their actions to voters,” Schumer and Gillibrand said in the statement. “Democrats are in a strong position to win seats and continue fighting for working families.”
State Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs, Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris and former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Director Nathan Sage are currently running to become Iowa’s Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate seat in 2026.
National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Tim Scott said in a statement the Senate GOP campaign arm “is confident Iowans will elect a Republican to continue fighting for them and championing President Trump’s agenda in 2026.” He also thanked Ernst for her service in Washington and in the military.
“Joni Ernst has dedicated her life to serving our nation and improving the lives of Iowans,” Scott said. “Traveling across the Hawkeye State with Joni, I know she loves Iowa, and Iowa loves her. We are grateful for all she has accomplished in helping Iowa families keep more of their hard-earned money and make Washington squeal.”
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said Ernst “dropped out of this race because she knows her support for Medicaid cuts is a nonstarter” — and said whoever becomes the GOP nominee for U.S. Senate will have to contend with “the same toxic Republican agenda that’s harming Iowa families.”
“The energy is on our side heading into the midterms as Iowans are fed up with Washington Republicans spiking costs for working people to deliver tax cuts for billionaires,” Hart said. “In 2026, Iowans will elect a Democrat to the U.S. Senate who will prioritize making Iowa economically prosperous and a healthier state.”
 Hinson expected to make a bid for U.S. Senate
There are two Republicans currently running for the nomination: former state lawmaker Jim Carlin and Joshua Smith, a former Libertarian candidate for the state Senate.
U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson of Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District is also expected to join the race. In a social media post Monday, Hinson thanked Ernst for her service and added that she and her husband will share an announcement soon.
“As we look forward, President Trump needs a fighter in the Senate who will always have his back to continue to cut spending, deport illegal aliens, and put working families first,” Hinson wrote. “I’ve stood shoulder to shoulder with the President to pass this America First agenda in the House and I would be his strongest ally in the Senate. Matt and I will have an announcement soon about how we believe we can best serve Iowa, and how we can help President Trump make America great again.”
Hinson has been working on reelection efforts in Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District in recent months. There are currently three Democrats running for the seat in 2026, state Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque,  Clint Twedt-Ball, the founder of the nonprofit Matthew 25 and Kathy Dolter, the former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College.
Katie Smith, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said Hinson’s expected move to the U.S. Senate race in 2026 shows Democrats have a strong chance in the 2nd District race.
“Ashley Hinson is clearly eager to jump off the sinking ship that is her re-election in Iowa’s 2nd district,” Smith said. “Hinson is terrified to face her voters, who’ve had a front row seat as she’s prioritized Washington and billionaires while voting to raise Iowans’ costs. There’s change coming in Iowa: voters are ready for new leadership and no matter what Hinson decides, she will lose her seat.”

(Department of Defense Inspector General)President Donald Trump will announce his intention to move U.S. Space Command headquarters out of Colorado to Alabama on Tuesday, officials told national news outlets including The Associated Press. 
Space Command has been at full operational capacity at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs since December 2023, after former President Joe Biden announced in July that year it would stay in Colorado. 
Colorado officials previously expressed concern that Trump’s decision during his first presidential term to move Space Command to Huntsville, Alabama, was politically motivated, as he waited until after the 2020 election to announce the move. Alabama went for Trump, a Republican, in that election, and Colorado went for Biden, a Democrat.

Colorado officials from both parties have advocated Space Command staying in Colorado. Peterson housed a previous version of Space Command from 1985 to 2002. The Air Force subsequently oversaw military space operations from the site.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026, said in a statement Tuesday his office has been preparing for legal action over a Space Command relocation if Trump “made such an unlawful decision.” Weiser said military families in El Paso County have relied on the decision to keep Space Command headquarters in Colorado.  
“The Trump administration should not play political games with our nation’s military readiness and military families,” Weiser said in a statement. ”Moving Space Command Headquarters to Alabama is not only wrong for our national defense, but it’s harmful to hundreds of Space Command personnel and their families.”

(courtesy of Steele Hays)The Trump administration’s order to stop construction of the nearly completed Revolution Wind project is putting hundreds of offshore workers out of a job — including dozens of local fishermen who voted for President Donald Trump and are asking him to reverse course.
A week ago, the acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Matthew Giacona, ordered the Danish wind developer Ørsted to stop all offshore work on the Revolution Wind farm so the federal government can​“address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States.” Giacona did not specify the nature of those security concerns.
Construction began on the 704-megawatt project in January 2024 and is now 80% complete, according to Ørsted. The wind farm is being built off the coast of Massachusetts and Rhode Island in a federally designated ​“wind energy area” that received sign-offs from multiple branches of the military, Canary Media reported Sunday.
Though often seen as opposed to offshore wind, many New England fishermen have made peace with the industry in recent years.
They increasingly rely on part-time salaries from wind companies as fishing revenues dry up. Over the past two years, Ørsted put 80 fishermen to work on the Revolution Wind project, paying out $9.5 million to captains, deckhands, and fishing boat owners, according to Gary Yerman, a Connecticut-based fisherman who founded and leads a fisher cooperative called Sea Services North America, which has an active contract to work on Revolution Wind.
“Most of us are Trump voters, and we still believe in a leader who builds. That’s why we’re asking President Trump to reverse the stop-work order issued to Revolution Wind by Interior,” Yerman told Canary Media.
The stop-work order echoes a similar one the Interior Department gave in April that froze all offshore work on New York’s Empire Wind project — a move that grounded Sea Services’ fishermen for a month, until Trump lifted the ban.
Yerman and other commercial fishermen remained quiet the last time Trump’s assault on a wind farm put them out of work. This time they’re speaking out.
“It’s madness to stop a project that already had permits,” said Jack Morris, a Massachusetts-based scalloper and manager for Sea Services who voted for Trump. ​“This is not something any of us planned for: the captains, the crew, the shore engineers, the people we buy food from for our trips.”

Ørsted was one of the first firms building turbines in U.S. waters to employ local fishermen, offering Sea Services a contract in 2021 to perform safety and scout tasks. The cooperative helped build Ørsted’s South Fork Wind — America’s first large-scale offshore wind farm, which went online last year.
Today, it’s common for wind developers to rely on local U.S. fishermen. Avangrid and Vineyard Offshore, codevelopers of the embattled Vineyard Wind project off the coast of Massachusetts, have paid out about $8 million over the past two years directly to local fishermen and vessel owners.
“If the infrastructure and pilings are already in, what good is stopping now?” fisherman Tony Alvernaz told Canary Media when asked about the Revolution Wind pause. A Massachusetts fisherman unaffiliated with Sea Services, Alvernaz works part-time for Vineyard Wind, assisting with the ongoing construction of its 62 turbines. Of those, 17 are already sending power to the grid.
Alvernaz is concerned about the Trump administration’s pattern of halting wind projects without warning and with little justification. Trump has already pressed pause on two of the five offshore wind farms currently under construction in America today.
Trump putting fishermen out of work
In a statement Monday, an Ørsted spokesperson said Revolution Wind supports more than 2,500 jobs around the U.S., including ​“hundreds” of local offshore jobs.
Commercial fishermen have spent a total of 1,109 days working at sea for Revolution Wind, according to Yerman. Now, sitting at the docks due to the Trump administration’s stop-work order, the 15 fishermen who planned to be at sea, working 10-day shifts throughout this month, will get paid nothing.
“Our cooperative only invoices when our boats are on active duty. Fishermen are paid for the days they work, not for standby,” Gordon Videll, CEO of Sea Services, told Canary Media. The group is calling on Trump to lift the ban so that its members can resume the job, which would have involved eight more fishermen helping with an offshore substation this fall.
The extra income from Revolution Wind has been a lifeline, particularly for scallop fishermen who, in recent years, have been severely restricted in how much they can fish.
Strict federal quotas have been put in place to allow scallop populations to rebuild after years of being overfished, according to Morris, but that has meant scallopers — who form the majority of Sea Services’ members — are off the water for about 10months a year.
Before the pause on Revolution Wind, scalloper Kevin Souza expected to make an additional $200,000 working on the project as a part-time boat captain for two years. Souza told Canary Media in February that, had he stuck to scalloping alone, he’d be ​“lucky” to earn $100,000 in a single year. The deckhands he hires only bring in around $30,000 per year working on scallop boats, but the offshore wind gig makes it possible for them to earn a ​“middle-class wage,” said Souza.
RI wind project was heading toward finish line. Now it’s about to veer into Boston federal court.

Souza has recruited both of his sons, his nephew, and other young people from longtime fishing families to work for the wind industry. They might have otherwise left the scallop industry if not for the supplemental income, he said.
Losing faith in Trump
As a group, America’s commercial fishermen have long been loyal to Trump. Last week’s order is shaking that confidence.
“I can’t think of one guy who isn’t a Trumper in our co-op. We’re blue-collar guys (and some gals too) who get up before dawn, work with our hands, and we trusted him to look out for us. The truth is, we love President Trump,” Yerman said.
In New Bedford, Massachusetts, home to the country’s most profitable fishing port, ​“TRUMP 2024” flags fly from dozens of boats docked in the harbor. A few of those crews work for the offshore wind companies, and at least one captain lowers his MAGAflag before setting out to the wind farms, according to Rodney Avila, a Sea Services fisherman.
That kind of faith makes Trump’s pause on Revolution Wind even more gutting. 
“It’s like having the rug pulled out from under you. … Nobody understands why Trump did it. I don’t know what Trump’s agenda is,” said Morris.
Trump’s attacks on wind have dried up job prospects for local fishermen up and down the East Coast. His administration’s hostile actions have thrown sand in the gears of a New Jersey wind farm that planned to start construction in the next three years, Maryland’s first offshore wind farm, and another wind project off the coast of Maine.
In addition to targeting individual projects, the Trump administration has initiated policies intended to undermine the entire sector: killing offshore wind leasing, pausing permitting for wind farms, and sunsetting tax credits critical to their economic viability.
Many fishermen, including those who have pocketed thousands by working at offshore wind farms, remain wary of the companies building turbines out at sea.
These fishermen made peace with offshore wind. Then Trump came along.

“No fisherman loves new structures in the water, but we all have grandkids,” Roy Campanale, a Sea Services member based in Rhode Island, told Canary Media. ​“We’ve lived with the water getting warmer, watched the fish move north, and had to adapt again and again.”
Trump’s pause on Revolution Wind imposes yet another hardship.
Alvernaz voted for Trump and opposes certain wind farms that he believes pose a risk to his favorite fishing grounds. He said that he does not support Revolution Wind due to its placement on Cox Ledge, a swath of seabed identified by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as critical habitat for Atlantic cod.
But if Trump decides to freeze Vineyard Wind, for example, Alvernaz said he ​“would not be happy.”
Alvernaz has worked on the water for over 40 years. Yerman’s fishing career spans 50 years. With nearly a century of combined experience in New England’s waters, neither of them are buying the Trump administration’s excuse for pausing Revolution Wind.
“Something about national defense? How can it be an issue of national defense if there are other wind farms out there with the same technology?” pondered Alvernaz. ​“It’s kind of odd.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-02 18:46:50+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Trump proposed getting rid of FEMA, but his review council seems focused on reforming the agency",Associated Press,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/02/trump-proposed-getting-rid-of-fema-but-his-review-council-seems-focused-on-reforming-the-agency/,A 12-person review council seems more focused on reforming than dismantling the Federal Emergency Management Agency.,"Four days after starting his second administration, President Donald Trump floated the idea of ” getting rid of ” the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which manages federal disaster response.
But at a meeting last week, the 12-person review council he appointed to propose changes to FEMA seemed more focused on reforms than total dismantlement.
FEMA must be “reformed into an agency that is supporting our local and state officials that are there on the ground and responsive to the individuals that are necessary to help people be healed and whole through these situations,” said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who co-chairs the council. But, she added, FEMA “as it exists today needs to be eliminated.”
However, the meeting Thursday in Oklahoma City offered hints of what types of reforms the council might present to Trump in its final report. Members mainly focused on conventional and oft-cited opportunities for change, such as getting money faster to states and survivors and enhancing the capacity of local emergency managers.
But some moves by the administration in the last several months have already undermined those goals, as mitigation programs are cut and the FEMA workforce is reduced. Experts also caution that no matter what the council proposes, changes to FEMA’s authority and operations require congressional action.
A Republican-dominated council
Trump created the FEMA Review Council through a January executive order instructing the group to solicit feedback from a “broad range of stakeholders” and to deliver a report to him on recommended changes within 180 days of its first meeting, though that deadline has lapsed.

The 12-person council is co-chaired by Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and vice-chaired by former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant. It is made up of elected officials, emergency managers and other leaders mostly from Republican states.
Trump “believes we should be in a disaster-response portfolio and footprint,” Noem said at Thursday’s meeting, “but the long-term mitigation should not be something that the federal government is continuing to be involved in to the extent that it has been in the past.”
Noem attended virtually, citing efforts toward “bringing some peace to the streets of Washington, D.C.”
Members on Thursday presented some findings collected in listening sessions conducted in multiple states and with Native tribes. Much of the discussion touched on the need to get money to states more quickly and with more flexibility. Trump and Noem have both supported the idea of giving states federal block grants quickly after a disaster instead of the current reimbursement model.
Members have spent “hours, maybe even days, exploring ways to accelerate local recovery through direct funding for public and individual assistance,” Guthrie said.
Making plans beforehand
Several members emphasized improving preparedness and mitigation before disasters hit.
“Mitigation saves lives, it protects property, it reduces cost of future disasters,” said Guthrie, but added that more responsibility should fall on individuals and state and local governments to invest in mitigation.
States like Texas and Florida have robust, well-funded emergency management agencies prepared for major disasters. Members acknowledged that if other state and local governments were to take on more responsibility in disasters, they still needed training support.
Methods for governments to unlock recovery dollars without relying on federal funds also came up, such as parametric insurance, which provides a rapid payout of a previously agreed-upon amount when a triggering event occurs.
The meeting focused less on individual survivor support, but Bryant brought up the need to reform — and protect — the National Flood Insurance Program, calling it “vital.” That program was created by Congress more than 50 years ago because many private insurers stopped offering policies in high-risk areas.
The rhetoric around FEMA is evolving
The conversation signaled a departure from some of the more aggressive rhetoric Trump and Noem have used in the past to describe their plans for FEMA. As recently as June, Trump suggested ” phasing out ” the agency after the 2025 hurricane season.
Michael Coen, who held FEMA posts under three presidential administrations, said after three council meetings, recommendations remain vague.
“Council members provided their perspective but have not identified the challenge they are trying to solve or offered a new way forward,” Coen said.
Coen also cautioned that any significant changes must go through Congress. Lawmakers in July introduced a bipartisan reform bill in the House. The so-called FEMA Act echoes some of the council’s priorities, but also proposes returning FEMA to a Cabinet-level agency.
“Most current proposed FEMA legislation strengthens FEMA,” said Coen.
Actions sometimes contradict words
Some of the administration’s actions so far contradict council members’ emphasis on expediency, mitigation and preparedness.
Noem now requires that she personally approve any DHS expenditure over $100,000. That policy led to delays in the Texas response, according to several reports, though Noem and acting administrator David Richardson have refuted those claims.
The administration halted a multibillion-dollar program for climate resilience projects, and Trump stopped approving hazard mitigation funding requests for major disasters. FEMA abruptly canceled or moved online some local preparedness trainings this spring, though many later resumed.
On Aug. 25, more than 180 current and former FEMA staff sent an opposition letter to the FEMA Review Council and Congress, warning that the agency is so diminished that a major climate event could lead to catastrophe.
At least some of the staff were put on paid administrative leave until further notice on Aug. 26.

An ongoing labor dispute in southeastern Vermont subsided on Labor Day when bus company Travel Kuz ended its lockout of bus drivers and monitors represented by the Vermont Teamsters Local 597 union.
The workers returned to transporting students enrolled in Windham Southeast Supervisory Union’s 10 schools in Brattleboro, Dummerston, Guilford, Putney and Vernon on Tuesday. 
The workers had been on the picket line for nearly two weeks since Travel Kuz locked them out from the company’s Brattleboro headquarters after contract negotiations stalled. The company brought in replacement workers for the start of the school year. 
Travel Kuz accused the union of unlawful picketing and endangering students in a cease-and-desist letter last week. Local law enforcement did not witness any unlawful activity and the Teamsters disputed the characterization. 
A spokesperson for Travel Kuz — affiliated with Beacon Mobility — wrote in a press release that the company ended the lockout because the union is ready to return to the bargaining table. 
“From the start, our hope has been to reach an agreement that is fair for employees and affordable for the town, while keeping the focus on what matters most: children arriving at school safely and returning home with care,” the spokesperson wrote. “We care deeply about our drivers and want to be sure they feel valued and fairly paid for the vital work they do.”
Curtis Clough, president of the Vermont Teamsters Local 597, said the union has “always been available to negotiate with the bus company,” even during the lockout. 
“We’d love to get back to the table with the company,” Clough said. “We’ve already sent the company multiple letters asking for them to come back to the table and negotiate, so hopefully that bears some fruit.”
Lena Melentijevic, spokesperson for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, wrote in a statement that Travel Kuz notified individual drivers and monitors late Monday afternoon that the lockout ended, but the union has not received direct communication from the company about the situation or future bargaining as of Tuesday.
“The company created a stressful situation for our members and the community,” Melentijevic wrote in a statement. “We call on the company to come back to the table and negotiate a fair contract for our members.”
Travel Kuz previously told VTDigger the union’s proposal would cause an “unrealistic burden” by expanding company costs by over 40%. 
At the Aug. 22 meeting held during the lockout, Clough said, the union adjusted its workers’ pay proposal but maintained its benefits request. He said the Teamsters Local 597 is asking for a contract pay package similar to bus drivers represented by the Teamsters in other states, particularly in New Hampshire. 
Clough said the company has repeatedly delayed workers’ pay, retirement matches and health care premiums, and has asked the union to agree to concessions such as limiting family and medical leave, barring drivers from taking on extra hours and canceling bus monitors’ pay guarantees.
The Vermont Teamsters Local 597’s want a fair contract that ensures members have what they “need to afford to live in the community and afford their health care,” Clough said. 
Windham Southeast Supervisory Union’s Superintendent Mark Speno wrote in a Tuesday statement that he is glad the drivers and monitors are able to return to work while a handful of replacement drivers continue to fill in for some routes. 
The supervisory union is hopeful the contract negotiations settle soon and the bus company makes improvements to the routing and communications systems, according to Speno.
“My expectation is that there is a contract settlement that recognizes support and balance within very few days, so we can all move forward,” Speno wrote.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma signing bonus program, intending to fill a critical workforce shortage in public schools, will reward 151 special education teachers up to $20,000 this school year.
The Oklahoma State Department of Education announced Tuesday the program will award signing bonuses to 34 experienced special education teachers who came from out of state and to 117 new teachers who recently became certified for the first time.
The program exceeded the agency’s initial goal of recruiting 110 special education teachers to work with students with disabilities. About 17% of public school students in Oklahoma are receiving services for a disability, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
Out-of-state teachers coming to Oklahoma were eligible for a $20,000 signing bonus this year and another $5,000 in the 2026-27 school year if they remain in the same district. 
Newly certified special education teachers qualified for a $10,000 signing bonus and a potential $2,500 retention bonus next year.
The initiative attracted educators from at least 17 states and Japan, the Education Department reported. Seventy-nine Oklahoma districts are participating.
Recipients of the signing bonuses are moving from Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Oregon, South Carolina and Texas, the agency said.
Agency spokesperson Madison Cercy said signing bonus recipients coming from California have been instructed to take an “America First” assessment. The Education Department developed the test with the conservative media entity PragerU to weed out educators with “woke agendas” who relocate from progressive states.
The agency also sent the notification to teachers moving from New York, Cercy said, though that state wasn’t one the Education Department initially listed in its announcement of the signing bonuses.
Another state agency that oversees teacher certification testing, the Office of Educational Quality and Accountability, has warned the “America First” test could overstep legal bounds. 
State law mandates that the Oklahoma State Board of Education “shall issue a certificate to teach to a person who holds a valid out-of-state certificate.” Oklahoma statutes require no further assessment besides a criminal history check for teachers who are already certified and moving from out of state.
The state Education Department first announced the $20,000 signing bonuses in April, saying at the time it had budgeted $1.875 million from the federal fund IDEA Part B, which supports students with disabilities.
This is the agency’s third round of signing bonuses for teacher recruitment under state Superintendent Ryan Walters.
Walters has leveraged hefty signing bonuses to attract hundreds of certified educators to return to teaching after having left the profession or to move to Oklahoma from other states.
In 2023, his administration offered between $15,000 and $50,000 to early elementary and special education teachers. The effort drew more than 500 teachers, though the Education Department paid a few by mistake.
The second wave of signing bonuses granted up to $25,000 to educators who accepted hard-to-fill math and science positions in rural middle and high schools. That initiative rewarded 61 teachers last year.
“Through investing in our educators and rewarding excellence we are making sure every child in Oklahoma has the opportunity to succeed,” Walters said Tuesday.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has authorized $1.5 million in emergency spending to help Mora County residents recover from recent flooding, according to a Tuesday news release from her office.
Heavy rainfall between Aug. 26 and 27 caused flood damages on public and private property, according to the governor’s office. The flooding disrupted essential services such as transportation, emergency response and utilities, according to an emergency order the governor signed. 
The order cites continued damage from the 2022 Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire, which burned a 485-square-mile area, including much of Mora County, in Northern New Mexico. 
County officials have requested the state’s help with procuring sandbags, along with emergency county-road repair and swift water rescue teams, according to the governor’s office. 
Amid FEMA uncertainty, Western governors commit to more coordination on post-fire flooding

National Weather Service reports show that flash flooding caused small creeks to flow above their banks in at least eight places along NM Highway 518, a major roadway, north of Cleveland, NM. Reports also show “extreme damage” to NM 434 prompted emergency responders to close it for repairs.
The emergency orders fund $750,000 apiece to the state’s emergency management and military affairs departments, according to the governor’s office. The governor can also authorize new funding, $750,000 at a time, as needed. 
Post-fire flooding has occurred repeatedly in and around the burn scar since the 2022 wildfire, which is the biggest in New Mexico history. Those who see damaged or lost property due to flooding are eligible for compensation from the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire Fire Assistance Act, a $5.45 billion fund Congress created in late 2022.
The governor’s office said those who have an outstanding claim with the claims office should reach out to their “navigators,” who help claimants through the process, if they have damages from the flooding last week.

In May, Lowell Area Schools Library Media Director Christine Beachler filed a civil suit against Stefanie Boone, whose children attend Lowell Area Schools, citing several false claims painting Beachler as a “smut peddler,” a “pedophile” and accusing her of providing pornography to children. 
Beachler’s case is one of many examples of libraries and librarians facing attacks from right-wing groups like Moms For Liberty who seek to purge books with racially-inclusive or LGBTQ+ content from shelves. 
While Beachler sought relief on the grounds that she’d been portrayed in a false light, and that Boone had intentionally inflicted emotional distress, Boone has filed a counter complaint arguing Beachler “used offensive and inappropriate language regarding Boone in her interviews, documentaries, and podcasts.” 
The countersuit points to several comments Beachler made addressing the attacks against her, arguing Beachler “intends to intimidate, threaten, harass, or annoy Boone and intends to discredit Boone through her own defamation campaign and to gain fame and notoriety.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Among the statements listed in the countersuit, Boone and her attorney, Matthew DePerno, disputed Beachler’s remark on a podcast that she and Boone had never met, and remarks to WOOD TV that she had faced death threats as the result of Boone’s social media posts and that “library books are optional. These are not required materials. These are not curriculum materials.”
Boone and DePerno have requested $250,000 in damages, alleging libel, slander and defamation; false light invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
Boone has also filed a civil rights case against Beachler, the school district and several district employees in 2024 arguing they violated her parental rights. While the district and its employees have filed a motion to dismiss with the U.S. District Court Western District of Michigan’s Southern Division, the court has yet to rule on the motion. 
DePerno is running for attorney general following an unsuccessful bid in 2022. He is facing felony charges as part of an alleged scheme to access and tamper with voting machines following the 2020 election, which current President Donald Trump lost to former President Joe Biden. He is also facing three counts of professional misconduct before the Michigan Attorney Discipline Board, according to a report from Bridge Michigan. 
In a response provided by her attorney, Beachler said she is aware of the counterclaims against her and that they have “absolutely no merit.”

Many in the wildland fire community believe the leadership team managing the fire sent crews into an ambush by federal immigration agents. (Photo by Bear Gulch Fire 2025 via Facebook) Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities last week raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.
Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.
Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.
The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.
“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”
Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.
One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.
“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”
Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.
Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.
After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.
After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.
“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”
In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.
Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.
“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”
After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.
The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.
Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.
A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.
The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.
“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.
Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.
The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.
Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.
One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.
The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.
“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”
Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.
“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.
On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.
“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”
Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.
“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”
Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.
“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”
In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.

The effort comes as the Trump administration cracks down on immigration across the country, ramping up arrests and deportations. Immigration courts also already are dealing with a massive backlog of roughly 3.5 million cases that has ballooned in recent years.
However, numerous immigration judges have been fired or left voluntarily after taking deferred resignations offered by the administration, according to their union. The International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, said in July that at least 17 immigration judges had been fired “without cause” in courts across the country.
That has left about 600 immigration judges, union figures show, meaning the Pentagon move will double their ranks.
The move is being done at the request of the Justice Department, and the memo noted that the details will initially last no more than 179 days but can be renewable.
When asked about the move, a DOJ spokesperson referred questions about the plan to the Defense Department. Pentagon officials directed questions to the White House.
A White House official said Tuesday that the administration is looking at a variety of options to help resolve the significant backlog of immigration cases, including hiring additional immigration judges. The official said the matter should be “a priority that everyone — including those waiting for adjudication — can rally around.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25237726982903-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-02 14:58:11.312355

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that his administration is researching a third immigrant detention facility, this one in West Florida. 
The state-run deportation facilities exising in the Everglades and planned for Baker County are a long distance from the western-most part of Florida, the governor said. 
“There’s a demand to have way more than just Alligator Alcatraz,” DeSantis said, and that immigration law enforcement efforts in the Panhandle recently showed how far away detainees must be transported. 
The first deportation facility, in the Everglades, opened earlier this summer, must be shut down, a federal judge ruled, although the state is fighting that ruling. 
Meanwhile, the state will open another deportation facility in Baker County “soon,” which the governor’s office has dubbed “Deportation Depot.”
Inspired by conversations with law enforcement officials in Panama City, “We’re actually in the process of figuring out how we can set up a Panhandle Pokey,” DeSantis said, continuing an alliterative theme. 
“You know, you’re in the Panhandle sending to Alligator Alcatraz, that’s a long way. Even sending to the Deportation Depot in North Florida, that could be three to five hours depending on where you are in the Panhandle,” DeSantis said.
Everglades facility
Although the Everglades facility has stopped accepting new detainees due to the court ruling, DeSantis said, “We’re ultimately going to win that fight.”
Critics point to the money the state spent on the facility only for it to possibly shut down. “We spent money and we will get reimbursed,” DeSantis said.

,DC,2025-09-02 17:57:39+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Democratic AGs disclose FEMA failed to make grants for months to critical disaster program,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democratic-ags-disclose-fema-failed-make-grants-months-critical-disaster-program,,"WASHINGTON — Democratic attorneys general have updated their complaint against the Trump administration in a lawsuit over whether the Federal Emergency Management Agency can refuse to spend pre-disaster mitigation grants approved by Congress.The attorneys general wrote in the new filing that FEMA hadn’t made a single award to the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program between April 2 and Aug. 25.“The BRIC program is critically important nationwide. Over the past four years, FEMA has selected nearly 2,000 projects from every corner of the country to receive roughly $4.5 billion in funding,” they wrote. “Due to the unique threats they face, coastal communities have received the largest allocations over the past four years, with California, Louisiana, Texas, New York, New Jersey, Florida, North Carolina, and Washington leading the way. “But interior communities rely on BRIC too: Pennsylvania and Utah have received the next largest allocations, and Ohio is not far behind.”FEMA announced in April that it was “ending” the program and “canceling all BRIC applications from Fiscal Years 2020-2023.” Members of Congress from both political parties brought up their disagreement with that decision in May during a hearing on FEMA’s budget request and by sending a letter signed by more than 80 lawmakers.But that didn’t appear to sway the Trump administration to reverse course and allocate the funding that had been approved by Congress. ‘Devastating’ delays in FEMA fundingDemocratic attorneys general, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro filed their lawsuit in July and later called on the judge to block the Trump administration from moving money out of the pre-disaster mitigation account. U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts Judge Richard G. Stearns, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton, issued a preliminary ruling in early August preventing FEMA “from spending the funds allocated to BRIC for non-BRIC purposes until the court is able to render a final judgment on the merits.”The updated 83-page complaint filed Friday argues the two people President Donald Trump has installed as acting FEMA administrator did so unlawfully because they were never formally nominated to run the agency, didn’t receive Senate confirmation and didn’t meet the qualifications laid out in federal law.  It also alleges that unilaterally canceling funding approved by Congress, which holds the power of the purse, violated the separation of powers laid out in the Constitution. “The impact of the shutdown has been devastating. Communities across the country are being forced to delay, scale back, or cancel hundreds of mitigation projects depending on this funding,” they wrote. “Projects that have been in development for years, and in which communities have invested millions of dollars for planning, permitting, and environmental review are now threatened. And in the meantime, Americans across the country face a higher risk of harm from natural disasters.”Each BRIC grant, the updated complaint notes, “can cover up to 75% of a project’s costs, and the federal share can rise to 90% for small rural communities.” Attorneys general from Arizona, California, Colorado. Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin filed the suit, along with the Pennsylvania and Kentucky governors.",,,,2025-09-02 14:58:11.312355

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)The Republican Party of Florida took a moment to celebrate itself on Tuesday, noting that the GOP now enjoys a 10-point voter registration lead over the Florida Democratic Party, 41%-31%. (The official numbers put Republicans at 40.8% and Democrats at 30.7%).
The remaining 28% of voters are either no party affiliation (NPA) or registered with third parties.
Republicans now hold a 1.353 million voter lead over Democrats statewide, the largest lead it has held over Democrats in statewide registration in Florida history.
In a press release, the GOP is boasting about its leads in previously Democratic strongholds like Miami-Dade County (now more than 35,000) and Hillsborough County (more than 17,000), and notes that they are getting closer in Duval and Palm Beach counties.
“This fight is far from over, but make no mistake — Florida is red, and we’re only getting stronger,” said Evan Power, the Republican Party of Florida chairman.
In Palm Beach County, another traditional Democratic powerhouse, the party’s voter registration lead over Republicans is now barely over 2%, according to Michael Pruser, director of data science with Decision Desk HQ.  And in Duval, the Dems have just a 2.5% lead over the GOP.
Florida Democrats had a more than 134,000 lead over registered Democrats going into the 2020 general election. In 2018, when Ron DeSantis needed a recount to defeat Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum by less than half a percentage point, the Democrats led Republicans in voter registration with by 263,269.
The increase in GOP voters and attrition of Democratic voters in Florida is now being replicated in many parts of the country. An analysis conducted by The New York Times last month showed that in the 30 states that track voter registration by political party the Democrats have lost 2.1 million registered voters between the 2020 and 2024 elections in those 30 states, while the Republicans gained 2.4 million voters.

(Screenshot courtesy NM Legislature) The head of the New Mexico Mortgage Finance Authority reported Tuesday that the authority has spent more than one-third of $166 million it’s received from lawmakers in recent legislative sessions.
Isidoro “Izzy” Hernandez, the authority’s executive director, told a legislative oversight committee during a meeting that the authority has spent more than $54 million that lawmakers have awarded the agency since 2024. 
The majority of that, about $29 million, has gone to provide down-payment assistance to first-time homebuyers, according to Hernandez’s presentation. Most of the rest of the funding, while not yet spent, is “awarded,” he said, which means it has been contractually committed to a program or recipient. 
The authority, which recently rebranded as Housing New Mexico, has been among the beneficiaries of a huge increase in state spending aimed at tackling the state’s affordable housing shortage.
Record number of housing bills introduced this session, but little to show for it, advocate says

New Mexico lacks at least 32,000 affordable rental units, according to recent estimates. Homelessness and median rents have also increased at rates higher than the national average in recent years. 
Lawmakers in the 2024 session gave the authority a one-time, $50 million payment for its Affordable Housing Trust Fund, which pays for a range of programs including down-payment assistance, housing rehabilitation and others. 
That’s on top of more than $100 million in recurring funding the authority received over the last three years in severance tax bonds, which come from oil and gas extraction. 
While the authority didn’t receive any extra funding during the session earlier this year, lawmakers approved $140 million for housing and anti-homelessness initiatives for other agencies, overseen by a new Office of Housing. Lawmakers last week celebrated the release of $80 million of that allocation for a range of developments in Bernalillo County. 
While Hernandez and lawmakers lauded the huge increase in funding, they also noted it presented new challenges. Hernandez described the state’s overall approach to housing delivery as “fractured,” citing discrete funding streams coming from the federal Housing Department and the new funds awarded to the Office of Housing.
The Office of Housing is “yet another agency” doing housing, which “potentially complicates things, or at least creates some confusion, with where the money is coming from, and who has access to it, and how it gets underwritten,” he said.
NM Rep. Marian Matthews (D-Albuquerque) said the acute homelessness problem in New Mexico underscores the need for more collaboration and a statewide plan. 
“This is such an important field, it just seems like there should be some coordination …being sure that we weren’t duplicating, being sure we weren’t omitting important parts of the state in providing help with housing,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-02-at-9.26.07-AM-1024x574.png,,,2025-09-02 13:57:19.638472

(Photo by Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Sen. Gary Stubblefield, a Branch Republican who served a dozen years in the Arkansas Senate, died Tuesday at the age of 74. 
The cause of death was unknown, said Senate Information Officer John Reed, who confirmed Stubblefield’s passing to the Advocate Tuesday morning. But the senator’s daughter, JordanAmber Sullivan, posted on social media on Aug. 26 that her father had undergone several surgeries for an unstated condition.
Reed said “the members and staff of the Arkansas Senate mourn the passing” of their colleague, who was elected to the Senate in 2012 after serving two terms in the House of Representatives. 
Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester said in a statement that Stubblefield “was a man of integrity” and committed to “protecting the rights of the unborn” and the Second Amendment. 
“Arkansas was blessed to have such a devoted public servant, and he will be missed dearly,” the Senate leader said.
“Senator Stubblefield’s life reflected a true commitment to public service and a genuine love for Arkansas,” House Speaker Rep. Brian Evans said in a social media post. “His time in the House and later in the Senate was marked by dedication to the people he represented. On behalf of the House, I extend our condolences to his family.”
Stubblefield represented Senate District 26, which includes parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian Counties. He won reelection in 2024 for a term that ends in 2029. His seat will be filled by a special election, according to Reed. The governor’s office did not respond to questions about details of the special election by publication.
A life-long dairy farmer and a member of the Baptist church, Stubblefield and his wife Kathi raised two children and “taught them the value of keeping one’s word, a hard day’s work and respecting the rights of others,” according to his Arkansas Senate biography.
Stubblefield “enjoyed a successful career” as a member of the Razorback football team while attending the University of Arkansas. 
“Senator Stubblefield was a strong advocate for his constituents with deeply held conservative values and a fierce love for his family,” Attorney General Tim Griffin said in a social media post. “He was proud to have walked on and played for @RazorbackFB under legendary Coach Frank Broyles, and he served Arkansans as a State Senator, State Representative, Justice of the Peace, School Board Member, and Farm Service Commissioner.” 
The longtime state lawmaker “sponsored legislation to protect the rights of the unborn and the elderly,” according to his Senate biography.
“He believes in protecting the rights of farmers and livestock growers, and in protecting the rights guaranteed to American citizens under the Second Amendment,” his biography states. “He supports legislation to lower taxes, reduce the size of government and simplify the regulatory burden on Arkansas businesses and residents.”
Stubblefield was chair of the Senate City, County and Local Affairs Committee, which last month hosted a meeting on the state’s prison population. Stubblefield was a vocal critic of a planned prison in Franklin County that is located near his family’s land. 
During the 2025 legislative session, Stubblefield sponsored legislation to require municipal improvement district boards to allow public comments before taking action on an agenda item, according to his Senate biography. He was also the Senate sponsor of a new law restricting the jurisdiction of cities in unincorporated areas, and he co-sponsored a law that allows the over-the-counter sale of Ivermectin for human use.
Senate Minority Leader Sen. Greg Leding, D-Fayetteville, said in a social media post that he was deeply saddened by Stubblefield’s passing. 
“While we often found ourselves on opposite sides, we each always knew where the other’d be  — and we could always talk about it,” Leding said.
“My heart is heavy after the passing of Sen. Gary Stubblefield,” Democratic Sen. Clarke Tucker of Little Rock wrote on social media. “Gary was an Ark. character & I mean that in the best way. We often disagreed on policy, but Gary was a man who always followed his convictions & unfailingly treated me with respect & kindness. Rest in peace my friend.”

Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, speaks on the South Dakota House floor on March 5, 2024. Hansen was the sponsor of a 2025 bill that would shorten the time for circulating ballot question petitions, but a judge ruled it unconstitutional. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The state of South Dakota cannot enforce a new law that would shorten the window for circulating ballot question petitions by three months, a judge has ruled.
U.S. District Judge Camela Theeler filed a written order Friday that says the law is a violation of First Amendment rights. As a limitation on political speech, she wrote, moving the election-year deadline from May to February “arguably goes beyond merely inconvenient and enters the realm of severe.”
The filing deadline dictates the amount of time petitioners have to gather the required number of signatures to put a statewide question on the ballot. Petitioners need 17,508 signatures from registered voters to propose a law, or to put a bill passed by legislators on hold so voters can consider it, which is known as a referendum. The number of signatures required to put a state constitutional amendment on the ballot is 35,017.
Governor candidate grilled on witness stand in lawsuit against shorter petition window

A ballot question committee that has worked on numerous campaigns, Dakotans for Health, filed the lawsuit in April after the Legislature and Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden approved the shorter deadline in March. Dakotans for Health’s leader, Rick Weiland, praised the judge’s decision Tuesday in a news release.
“Once again, our state’s Republican supermajority tried to rig the rules to keep everyday South Dakotans from having a voice in their own government,” Weiland said. “And once again, a court sent them packing.”
The law shortening the deadline started as legislation from state House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, who is one of several candidates for governor next year. Neither he nor the state Attorney General’s Office — which defended the state in the litigation — immediately responded Tuesday to messages from South Dakota Searchlight. If the state chooses to appeal the ruling, its deadline to file an appeal is Sept. 29.
The legal battle is part of a broader struggle between ballot petitioners and Republican legislators over citizen lawmaking. During this year’s legislative session, for example, Hansen also prime-sponsored a successful bill adding justifications for the secretary of state to reject petition signatures. He cosponsored a bill vetoed by the governor that would have required constitutional amendment petitions to have signatures from registered voters in each of the 35 state Senate districts. Existing law allows signatures to come from registered voters anywhere in the state.
Those and other Republican-led efforts to restrict citizen ballot questions in South Dakota have come in response to the passage of ballot measures that many Republican lawmakers opposed. Examples have included ballot questions that raised the minimum wage, expanded Medicaid eligibility and legalized medical marijuana.

Her burlap-hued dress billowed in the hot wind, carved wooden disc earrings swayed from each lobe, and black mascara lent her stony expression considerable intensity.
She was there Aug. 11 for a hearing that could change the outcome of what she perceived as a great personal tragedy: her daughter’s loss of a homecoming queen election.
“We want the truth,” Sims-Bush wrote on Facebook. “The district is fighting to keep the facts surrounding the results hidden.”
Indianola’s Gentry High School, where Sims-Bush’s daughter is a student, has been holding elections for homecoming queen, or Miss Gentry, since 1954. Recent celebrations included programs printed on metallic foil, two grand thrones moved to the center of a gymnasium festooned with candelabras and chandeliers, rented luxury cars to ride through the annual homecoming parade and a military salute performed by the JROTC befitting a monarch of a lesser but no less grand principality. All this to say, contestants “show out,” in the words of a former school administrator.
But it still came as a surprise to current administrators, when they were sued for $100,000. The accusation against them: stealing a homecoming election for a beloved teacher’s daughter.
Sims-Bush had previously lent her event-planning talent to the school. She decorated a loft space with silver balloons and floats inspired by awards shows for last spring’s prom.
Seven years ago, Sims-Bush transformed the school gymnasium into a medieval courtyard with hedges, gold-colored chairs, sod and a fortress cutout. It was for her elder daughter’s homecoming queen coronation. In 2023, she had changed the gymnasium into an enchanted forest with jungle vines, jewel-toned chairs, fake myrtle trees and a backdrop reminiscent of the forest from “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.”
For 10 years, Sims-Bush has run her event-planning company in the Mississippi Delta. She has hosted galas requiring black tie attire for male attendees and floor-length gowns for female guests. At one of her more recent events at Harlow’s Casino in Greenville, hundreds of guests crowded into a banquet hall for Havana Nights, which featured a cigar bar and performances by fire dancers and contortionists. Guests included local mayors and university administrators. 
Her social media account conveys the impression of a well-connected and highly organized professional.
“She appears to have it all,” said one current teacher on staff, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation at work.
But not quite all.
‘Who will win the throne?’
At Gentry High, the morning announcements in late April heralded the call for nominations for homecoming court. Teachers and administrators gave out handouts with nomination guidelines. Students probably had been mulling a run for homecoming queen much earlier, though. For the confident few, it meant ordering campaign banners and forming a winning strategy with parents and friends since at least February.
“Who will win the throne? What can you do to stand out from the rest! Well … this year we shall see! WELCOME to an unforgettable year of campaigning. Below are the guidelines for this year’s battle,” read Gentry’s handout for 2025 homecoming court elections.
Between hosting Thirsty Thursday, Wine Down Wednesday and more banquets for adults, Sims-Bush found the time to manage her younger daughter’s campaign for the homecoming tiara.
In a professionally produced campaign video released May 12, Sims-Bush’s daughter struts by the campus’ exterior in three separate couture looks.
“A brand isn’t just a logo, a slogan or a catchy name,” she says. “A brand is a promise. I don’t want to just wear the crown, I want to carry the responsibilities that come with it. When you cast your vote, you’re not just choosing a queen, you’re choosing a brand of leadership that’s committed to you.”
Sims-Bush also posted reels from six past homecoming queens entreating followers to cast their votes for her daughter.
“That experience did not only give me the opportunity to wear a crown,” the 2016-2017 queen said in one. “It showed me the importance of character, respect and school spirit.”
Before school started on April 14, a pop-up shop went up in the gym. The bubble gum pink store with glass cases featured free custom hats, tote bags, reusable cups and goodie bags – all stamped with Bush’s homecoming campaign logo: a “V” and “K” in a sleek font reminiscent of luxury branding. 
Sims-Bush arrived on campus each day of the campaign to help set up a new booth. Wednesday it was a Milan-inspired eatery featuring freshly made pizzas and a Kermit-green float. Thursday it was a Chanel-themed mixer with lunch boxes stamped with the designer logo and a shelf of pink-colored mocktails. Friday it was a “Breakfast at Tiffany’s”-inspired buffet. Dozens of strawberries and madeleines covered a table offering muffins from stands. 
On the Friday before voting ended, students and faculty departed their classrooms to see homecoming queen candidates show their talent. A majority of contestants danced to popular music, gyrating in leotards and street wear.
Sims-Bush’s daughter hosted a fashion show with the help of at least 16 classmates. The event boasted a runway and two lines of chairs on either side for spectators. The bass thumped as the teen pageant queen hopeful sashayed down white carpeting in what appeared to be a pink ostrich feather skirt. 
Students left school that Friday with goodie bags from her of hot fries and custom tees. Voting would continue through the weekend.
Sims-Bush said she felt Latoya Henry, the teacher monitoring the campaigns, and Lilly Hamilton, a popular Gentry High teacher, were too friendly. Hamilton’s daughter was the other leading contender.
She expressed her concerns in a series of emails she began writing on the second day of campaign week.
“For a parent to walk into a school and feel the hate is absurd. Henry called me ‘one sided brain’ and stormed out of a meeting because I asked her to provide a set timeframe for activities during campaign week,” Sims-Bush wrote.
“The expectation was for other parents to dumb down their displays to match the basic lackluster display of her friends,” she wrote. “We have been treated so ugly all because of thinking outside the box and campaigning.”
‘The national election doesn’t even take a week’

As early as Tuesday of campaign week, Sims-Bush said she began to doubt the integrity of the upcoming election.
“The voting system is as air tight as we can get it,” replied Superintendent Miskia Davis in an email. “No school or district staff member other than Mr. Jones, a 32 year old white guy from New Jersey has access.”
It was Dylan Jones, that 32-year-old white guy from New Jersey, that Tonia Sims-Bush figured was the mastermind of a scheme to defeat her daughter. She was wary of the Google Form used for the election and the tech-savvy data director monitoring the elections.
She wanted paper ballots.
“While we understand the desire for a process that feels traditional, the reality is that digital voting is vastly more secure, more transparent, and more auditable than paper ballots,” Jones, federal programs and data director, wrote in a handout to parents and staff.
Google’s security software would flag adults who tried to vote with a student email address by identifying the login address and device, he reassured parents in the handout.
Before 7 a.m. the Saturday after campaigning drew to a close, Sims-Bush emailed Davis detailing a conspiracy to steal an election for her daughter’s opponent.
“A 5 day voting window is insane,” she said in an email. “No one had given any good reason why a five day voting window over the weekend is necessary for a student campaign except to cheat. 
The voting had been done on Google Form over the course of several days for at least the past two years.
She convinced Sunflower County Circuit Clerk Carolyn P. Hamilton to process votes in place of the Google Form method, which was already underway.
“Prior to the voting, she contacted me and asked if I could do the voting process instead of the students using Google [Forms]. I informed her that the timing would be tight but if I worked through the weekend I could get it done. I also told her that the School Board will have to approve it before I do anything,” she wrote in a statement to Mississippi Today.
“This would be a one-day process not five,” she stressed. 
‘The Cadillac version of Google’
On May 21, an email announced a runoff election just after 5 p.m.
Sims-Bush’s daughter and Hamilton’s daughter tied. Chromebooks would be dispersed the next day in classrooms – and students would have an hour to vote.
The winner was announced one hour after voting ended.
It wasn’t Sims-Bush’s daughter.
The following morning, Sims-Bush alleged fraud in an official complaint to the school district and requested it look into whether anyone but a student had voted in the election.
“After the runoff election voting window closed, the superintendent published the certified results, naming the daughter of the faculty member, who had unrestricted access to student accounts, and the openly acknowledged bestie of the staffer facilitating the election process the winner,” she wrote in her complaint.
Mississippi Today could not verify whether Hamilton had “unrestricted access.”
Four years prior, a Pensacola, Florida, assistant principal and her daughter were charged with rigging a homecoming queen election. The mother and daughter had access to student emails. A teacher responsible for administering the student election saw that 117 votes were flagged as “false” by Election Runner, an app that runs secure student elections for the district. An investigation followed. The daughter was expelled and charged as an adult after coronation.
Sims-Bush said she found it suspicious that a runoff was called without the vote tally posted.
“As a participant’s parent, I reiterate my request for a review of the May 20th election results,” she added.
Within a week, Sims-Bush had retained counsel and submitted a public records request to inspect the voting records.  
She wanted to examine the generated spreadsheet’s time stamps to see if votes were added after the official voting window had closed – and whether each voter was a student in the school by looking at “digital footprint.”
The school district refused. 
In the district office’s conference room, between a plea for cooperation on an oral history project and the honoring of a former superintendent, Sims-Bush made her concerns known during the June 10 school board meeting. A video recording of the meeting was posted online by Mic Magazine, a Facebook page that covers locals news in the Mississippi Delta.
More soft-spoken, Sims-Bush, reading from prepared notes, rattled off complaints and spoke to the injustices her family faced. 
“It has been horrible. What started as a campaign issue has unraveled so many flawed systems. All types of chaos,” she said. “The goal here is to get official documented results from the school leadership campaign. Dylan Jones made it clear that you pay $1,000 a year for the Cadillac version of Google. We have that recorded. So there shouldn’t be any reason why we shouldn’t be able to see the official results as opposed to something that someone just typed up. ”
She then looked up from her notes to address the board directly. The air conditioning churned.
“Thank you,” said Debra Jones, the school board member for District 3.
The rest of the school board offered no comment.
Two days later, Sims-Bush through attorney Dale Dean filed a lawsuit against Davis, the high school’s principal and Jones to compel them to allow inspection of the “digital footprint” of each voter and time stamps on the generated spreadsheet.
She also wanted $100,000 for “mental anguish,” the cost of filing the claim, loss of economic opportunity, past medical expenses and other enumerated damages.
“I have largely ignored you during this process, as I believe my God-given energy should not be wasted on foolishness,” assistant superintendent William Murphy wrote in his “final” email on the subject.
“This is clearly a sign that the election has gotten you completely outside of yourself.”
‘We are talking about high school students’
Eleven weeks after Hamilton’s daughter was declared the winner, Sims-Bush sat in a mostly empty Greenwood courtroom in the company of friends, family and counsel. 
When Circuit Judge Richard A. Smith took his seat, whispers between counsel and client fell to a hush. The school district’s attorney began oral arguments.
“We are talking about high school students,” Mackenzie Price said.
She spoke of the potential for bullying should the metadata or “digital footprint” be made available for Sims-Bush to inspect. 
“It would bleed into the hallways,” Price added.
Sims-Bush would have access to the addresses of students if they voted from home and to student names by even glimpsing at the initials listed on the generated spreadsheet. It would be a violation of the Family Education and Right Privilege Act.
The plaintiff wanted to know who her friends’ kids voted for, she interpreted. She was a “disgruntled parent.” Sims-Bush shook her head and looked to her aunt for support.
“The cloud over this matter” is why we’re here today, Dean responded. “All matters of unethical things” and “shenanigans” have taken place. Counsel has submitted “quite voluminous briefs” to “confuse the court.”
He held up case law that had since been overruled as justification for his client’s right to inspect the election metadata. Price noted that case law in asking for a summary judgment for the school district. The judge agreed.
The proceeding was over within an hour. 
“Parents now, and I’m guessing going forward, have to rely on the word of people in a district known for fraud, forgery and misconduct when it comes to student elections and other student issues,” Sims-Bush wrote in a comment on Facebook. “It’s sad.”
‘Money can’t buy everything’
She followed her counsel to the hallway outside the courtroom for a huddle. They were discussing strategy and a possible appeal.
“The district adamantly denies any allegations that it was involved in any politics regarding a student election,” said Carlos Palmer, attorney for Sunflower County Consolidated School District. “This particular suit that was filed completely lacked merit and was a waste of district resources that could’ve been better used educating the school’s students.”
The district’s insurance rate could be raised because of the lawsuit, he said. 
In the 12 years he has represented school districts, he said he has never come across a lawsuit stemming from a homecoming queen election or any other student personality contest.
Asked to describe personal damages incurred from the alleged theft of the homecoming queen crown, Sims-Bush refused comment on three separate occasions.

On Aug. 17, Greenville Mayor Errick D. Simmons honored Sims-Bush for bringing “regional and national attention to Greenville” and for elevating “the Mississippi Delta as a destination for luxury weddings, sophisticated celebrations and world-class event design.”
When Sims-Bush exited the Leflore County courthouse, she had not let her counsel know whether an appeal would be filed. As of Monday, an appeal has not yet been filed.
“We don’t want student info, we want the truth,” Sims-Bush wrote on Facebook. “What started as a campaign issue is now an issue of moral and ethics.”
“August 20 will be three months and we still have no true results,” she recently posted.
But in town, locals had other ideas about what took place in the Miss Gentry contest in May. Mississippi Today was able to poll half a dozen local residents.
“Money can’t buy everything,” said Tawana, a Popeye’s employee in Indianola and a Gentry alum who wished to be identified by her first name because she has family that attend the school. “Loyalty is something, too. They voted correctly. That’s that situation. You can’t sue nobody for that, neither.”
Gentry High School’s homecoming is Oct. 17.
In conversations with three past Miss Gentry winners, Mississippi Today was able to confirm that the perks of the crown are limited to appearances at schoolwide events, riding on a float during the homecoming parade and free access to home games. The title carries no cash prize, no scholarship money and no keepsake except the crystal encrusted metal crown bestowed upon the winner. In some years, there is a scepter, too.
One Miss Gentry from 20 years ago theorized that the competition became more fierce and pricey when social media became part of homecoming court election strategy.
“It used to just be about fun,” shared a former Miss Gentry who won her tiara nearly two decades ago. “Parents were not involved. I sang badly to a gospel recording and won because I could make people laugh.”
“It’s still one of the happiest days of my life.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/02093537/Gentry-Homecoming-FeatImage-01.jpg,,,2025-09-02 13:57:19.638472

Free.,Judge warns of 'national police force' in ruling Trump broke the law sending Guard to LA,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-warns-national-police-force-ruling-trump-broke-law-sending-guard-la,,"President Donald Trump’s move to send National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles this summer violated a federal law against military members conducting domestic law enforcement, a federal judge in California ruled early Tuesday.The ruling from Senior U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer represents an obstacle to any further use of National Guard troops to assist local police in more cities. Following deployments to LA and Washington, D.C., Trump has openly mused about federalizing other state National Guard troops and sending them to major cities like Chicago and Baltimore he says are overwhelmed with crime.Breyer, whom Democratic President Bill Clinton appointed in 1997, said Trump could not use the National Guard for a wide array of police activities in California. His order goes into effect Sept. 12.Breyer said the roughly 4,700 Guard members and Marines engaged in police activity in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which he said built on the constitutional framers’ wariness of a centralized military force conducting police work.“Contrary to Congress’s explicit instruction, federal troops executed the laws,” Breyer wrote in a 52-page opinion. “Defendants systematically used armed soldiers (whose identity was often obscured by protective armor) and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence in and around Los Angeles. In short, Defendants violated the Posse Comitatus Act.”National Guard expandedThe judge expressed concern about Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s statements they wanted to expand the role of National Guard troops for law enforcement.“President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have stated their intention to call National Guard troops into federal service in other cities across the country… thus creating a national police force with the President as its chief,” he wrote.The issue itself dates much further back in U.S. history, forming part of the basis for the country’s break from the English monarchy, Breyer noted.“Indeed, resentment of Britain’s use of military troops as a police force was manifested in the Declaration of Independence, where one of the American colonists’ grievances was that the King had ‘affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power,’” he wrote.California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who sued to block Trump’s federalization of the state’s National Guard, said the ruling “sided with democracy and the Constitution” and echoed Breyer’s warning about Trump leading a national police force.“No president is a king — not even Trump — and no president can trample a state’s power to protect its people,” Newsom said. “Trump’s attempt to use federal troops as his personal police force is illegal, authoritarian, and must be stopped in every courtroom across this country.”Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass also cheered the decision.“The White House tried to invade the second largest city in the country,” she wrote. “That’s illegal. Los Angeles will not buckle and we will not break. We will not be divided and we will not be defeated.”Spokespeople for the White House did not immediately return a message seeking comment.Return to appeals court likelyTrump is likely to appeal the ruling to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where he won a victory early in the case.After Breyer issued a temporary restraining order in June calling on Trump to return control of the state’s National Guard to Newsom, a 9th Circuit panel unanimously blocked it from going into effect, ruling that U.S. Supreme Court precedent allowed Trump to make the determination that the proper circumstances existed to federalize National Guard troops.That appeals ruling dealt with Breyer’s finding that Trump likely violated the president’s legal authority to federalize National Guard troops.The appeal did not consider potential Posse Comitatus Act violations, Breyer said Tuesday.",,,,2025-09-02 13:57:19.638472

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana has again earned a AAA credit rating — the highest possible — from the three major credit-rating agencies, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun’s administration announced Tuesday.
“Indiana’s AAA rating is more than a financial milestone,” Braun said in a news release. “It’s a signal to taxpayers, investors, and businesses that our state is well-managed, fiscally responsible, and focused on delivering growth for Hoosiers throughout the State.”
 Indiana Gov. Mike Braun talks at a news conference on Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Just 14 states have top marks from the trio of major credit-rating agencies, which include S&P Global Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings.
Indiana has held an AAA rating from all three since 2010. Its most recent ratings came in September 2024, this April and in June.
The trio lauded the Hoosier State for active budget management, low debt, strong and transparent fiscal policies, and budgetary reserves that provide the foundation for an economy that has benefited from recent economic development investments, according to the news release.
“The AAA rating is the gold standard and allows Indiana to borrow at lower interest rates,” said Indiana Secretary of Management and Budget Lisa Hershman.
“That saves taxpayer dollars and strengthens the state’s ability to invest in infrastructure, education, and public services,” she added. “It also strengthens Indiana’s competitive edge in attracting new business and expanding economic opportunity statewide.”

(Getty Images)A mine manager from Kentucky pleaded guilty last week to conspiring to cover up a fire and keep miners working despite the danger in an underground coal mine in southern Illinois.
Timothy Brandon Parsons, 38, of Louisa, Kentucky, entered a guilty plea Aug. 29 to conspiring to defraud the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a $250,000 fine.
Parsons was mine manager at the MC#1 Mine in Franklin County, Illinois, in August 2021 when a cutting torch ignited a fire underground.
“When the fire could not be extinguished within 10 minutes, rather than implementing the approved Mine Emergency Evacuation and Firefighting Plan, Parsons and conspirators agreed that they would not evacuate miners or notify MSHA,” says a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice that describes Parsons as “former manager” of the Illinois mine.
“Gas detectors carried by miners alarmed for the presence of more than 10 parts per million of carbon monoxide, yet the mine continued to mine coal during ad hoc firefighting efforts over the course of three shifts from Aug. 12 to 13.”
The Justice Department release says Parsons “tried to conceal the existence of the fire from those not already aware of it by evacuating the mine on the false pretense that a belt used to carry coal from underground to the surface was broken.
“Later that morning, MSHA received an anonymous tip about the fire and then later ordered that the mine be evacuated after inspectors confirmed the existence of the fire. 
“Despite the evacuation order, over the next several days, conspirators re-entered the mine on two occasions without MSHA’s permission to assess the fire and manipulate the conditions underground so that MSHA would allow mining to resume. Members of the conspiracy did not wear tracking devices designed to track the underground location of miners and made false entries in mine records,” the Justice Department said.
The Department of Labor Office of Inspector General and FBI investigated the case.
Sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 18.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-96390221-coal-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-02 13:57:19.638472

Property tax cuts and shrinking grants pinch county budgets as Wyoming towns turn to volunteers to keep libraries going.
The post Big Horn County closes two libraries, cuts staff salaries and benefits appeared first on WyoFile .","GREYBULL—“They’re gutting our little community,” Chelsea Yates of Deaver said, holding back tears, as she addressed the Big Horn County Library Board at its Aug. 12 meeting.
The Big Horn County library system faces a $70,000 cut in county funds this year, 20% of last year’s budget. As a result, the county’s three largest libraries — Lovell, Basin and Greybull — have faced reduced hours and the removal of benefits for all staff members. 
Its smallest libraries, Frannie and Deaver, were closed permanently Monday.
Next year, property tax cuts are expected to deplete the budget even more.
Commission cuts
“Why are we getting these cuts this year? That is something I have asked, and [the commissioners] don’t have an answer… They told us 10% and we could have dealt with that… and then they said 20%,” library board member Lea Sorensen said at the August meeting.
Commissioners made cuts across the board this budget season, with elections taking a 59% hit, emergency management down 55% and local emergency planning down 30% — to name a few. Grant money overall, including American Rescue Plan Act funds, has been reduced, leaving Big Horn County Search and Rescue with almost $57,000 less in its budget.
The commission did not reply to requests for comment by the Greybull Standard’s deadline.
“We have cut to the bone. I don’t know where else we can cut,” Sorensen said of the library budget.
Library board president Nikole Greene and board member Cari Waterworth attended the Big Horn County Commissioners’ Aug. 5 meeting to address maintenance costs on the county-owned library buildings in Basin and Lovell, amounting to $9,419 covered through the library’s budget.
Currently, the Lovell library pays $1,292 a year in grounds maintenance.
Library Director Tina Ely reported to the board that in Basin, utility bills range from $700-$800 a month. Custodian wages amount to $7,377 for both libraries. 
The library board asked for county assistance in covering maintenance costs and, in turn, was presented with a lease proposal. Lovell and Basin libraries have operated out of county-owned buildings with no lease in place since their implementation. 
County Maintenance Supervisor Jeremy Pouska said that in the past, the county has been happy to help the libraries with maintenance when requested. However, there is no written agreement as to what each entity is expected to address. 
Upon notification of the library board members’ attendance, the county drafted a lease agreement for the Basin library “in an effort to be equitable” to all the organizations that lease county buildings. Leadership was uncertain of the Lovell building’s status at the time and, therefore, unprepared to propose a similar agreement for that building.
“Everybody’s hurting, and unfortunately, we just think next year is going to be even worse with the property tax stuff.”Deb Craft, Big Horn County Commission Chair
The lease would require the library to maintain the building’s day-to-day upkeep, while the county maintains the grounds. The suggested rent would be $1 a year.
“I mean, you need to come up with $9,500, I don’t know where we would get it. We just cut everything back,” Commissioner Mike Jolley said to the library board members.
County Commission Chair Deb Craft added: “Everybody’s hurting, and unfortunately, we just think next year is going to be even worse with the property tax stuff.”
Librarians take a hit 
On top of reduced staff hours — Lovell losing 10 a week, Greybull and Basin down 12 — librarians in all three counties have agreed to take on some janitorial duties to reduce that part of the library budget.
“There’s so much that these women, because they’re all women… are doing other than checking books in and checking books out,” Ely told the board. “Their hours are considerably cut, and we’re just hoping they can still continue to get all of that programming done and get all of that stuff done with less hours.”  
“While asking them to maintain buildings,” Greene added, with no workers’ compensation. 
Three library managers and Ely agreed to give up their Wyoming retirement benefits, amounting to $24,000. Commissioners requested confirmation on the legality of this concession; should it prove faulty, that money will have to be cut elsewhere.  
In addition, all library employees gave up their three personal paid days off. 
Ely forfeited reimbursement for her mileage driving between towns. Troy  Butler, who handles the library’s bookkeeping, agreed to a 20% decrease in the fees for his accounting services.  
Before cuts, Lovell salaries were $51,000, Basin $50,000 and Greybull  $45,000 for three employees in each branch.  
Commissioners suggested a cut to Ely’s $42,000 salary to add hours for payroll and grant writing to managers’ positions.  
“When this county ran into having to cut people before, the people within the departments agreed to cut their wages so that a person didn’t get cut. (Those were) sacrifices that this county’s departments have made before,  so I think they can look a little deeper here,” Craft said.
Grants and Friends of the Library donations are not able to cover salaries or operating expenses. 
“It’s our ox that got gored and died.” Melvyn Wambeke
Frannie and Deaver
Frannie and Deaver’s libraries are run out of town-owned buildings at no charge to the county. 
Between the two of them, the county budgeted $8,000 for salary. The library board voted to cut this funding, essentially shuttering the libraries, effective Monday.  
Several members of the Deaver community attended the August library board meeting.  
“It’s our ox that got gored and died,” citizen Melvyn Wambeke told the board.  
Previously, Melvyn and Sally Wambeke had proposed a 25% cut in Frannie and Deaver’s library hours — already only operating four hours a week —  to be equalized by cuts in the larger libraries’ hours. This would prevent a 100% shutdown, the Wambekes suggested.  
However,  the closure decision had already been finalized, and the library board did not double back, noting concerns that even more cuts would have to be made to the budget. 
Board members apologized to the Deaver and Frannie communities, saying that they did not want the closures.  
“By statute, we have one library to provide per county,” Commissioner Craft said Aug. 5.
She added that due to the size of the county, she believed a north and south library are needed.  
The library board voted to close the Frannie-Deaver bank account, which put roughly $200 back in the library’s general fund. The towns of Frannie and Deaver have stepped up to keep their libraries open without county assistance.
They will lose roughly 60 books between the two towns but maintain the library donations their communities have generated over the years, the majority of their shelves.  
The Town of Deaver voted last month to keep the library open with volunteer help, pending approval from the town’s insurance provider. This should add no additional costs to the town’s budget.  
“I think there’s a lot of people and kids that use it. I know there’s not a lot of heavy traffic, but the library is a value added, an asset to our community,”  Deaver Mayor Bill Camp said in an interview with the Greybull Standard.
“We value education, which it’s a part of, and encourage everybody to use it in some way,” he said. 
The Town of Frannie has instated a similar system. The library board has requested a bookmobile from Park County be brought to Frannie, as it spans county lines.  
Deaver and Frannie residents will still be able to use county-owned books, but no longer through their local libraries. Libraries will lean heavily on volunteers to ease the burden on librarians this year.  
“Even with doing this, we are a sinking ship of volunteers trying to keep our county with some sort of library system, period,” Sorensen said.

(Photo by John Raoux/The Associated Press)Workers’ compensation insurance rates in Florida should decrease by an average 6.9% in 2026 under a proposal by the National Council on Compensation Insurance.
Submitted last month, the NCCI’s proposed reduction is a recommendation only. Rates are set by the Florida Commissioner of Insurance, usually after a public hearing.
The recommended filing is based on experience data for policy years 2022 and 2023 as of year‐end 2024. The proposed reduction is being driven by declines in lost-time claim frequency, according to a summary from NCCI.
“The workers compensation system remains healthy. For the last decade, the system has broadly benefited from a steady drop in claim frequency, rising wages, and moderate severity. The changing workforce and evolving economy also continue to impact workers compensation,” the summary notes.
Workers’ compensation is a no-fault system that aims to protect employers from getting sued by injured employees and, in exchange, employers provide employees injured on the job the care they need to return to work. Employers are required to provide compensation for lost wages if an employee misses more than eight days of work due to an on-the-job injury.
Most employers in Florida are required to carry workers’ compensation insurance but there are exceptions for businesses with four or fewer employees and for construction companies with four or fewer officers. While those firms aren’t mandated to carry the coverage, they are required to file for exemptions with the state. Data show that 203,365 employers filed for exemptions with the state in calendar year 2024.
Workers’ compensation affects a large and disparate group of interests, including business groups, labor unions, insurance companies, plaintiffs’ attorneys, and injured workers. Because of that, workers’ comp bills in the Florida Legislature attract a spate of special interests, and getting changes passed through the Legislature and signed into law isn’t always easy.
A 2025 review of 50 states and Washington, D.C., workers’ compensation rates by the Oregon Department of Consumer and Businesses Services shows Florida ranked No. 30 in the nation for workers’ comp costs in 2024. That’s an improvement from the previous analysis of 2022 premium data, when Florida ranked No. 28 for workers’ comp premiums.
Hawaii had the highest workers’ compensation costs in 2024, according to the report, followed by New Jersey, New York, California, and Vermont. North Dakota had the lowest rates in the nation.
If the proposed reduction (or a modified reduction) is approved, it will be the ninth consecutive year in which workers’ compensation rates have been ordered reduced by the state’s insurance commissioner. Florida Insurance Commissioner Mike Yaworsky on Nov. 18 last year ordered an average 1% rate decrease in workers’ compensation rates effective Jan. 1.

Federal immigration officials in Washington state arrived on the scene of the largest wildfire in the state on Wednesday and arrested two firefighters who had been working to contain the blaze.
Wildfire veterans say it’s nearly unprecedented for federal agents to conduct immigration enforcement near the front lines of an active wildfire. Some fear the raid could reverberate throughout the wildland fire community, making it more difficult to fully staff the crews putting out blazes at the peak of fire season in the West.
“There’s a lot of brown bodies out there on the fire line,” said Bobbie Scopa, who had a 45-year career as a firefighter and now serves as executive secretary with Grassroots Wildland Firefighters, a nonprofit that advocates on behalf of wildfire professionals.

Scopa noted that President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has swept up even some workers who are in the country legally.
“When the rumble from this goes around, we’re going to have contractors unable to put out as many crews as they were,” she said. “We don’t know what the requirement is not to get shipped off by ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. Even if you’re a citizen and you look the wrong way, you could still get picked up.”

On Wednesday morning, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents pulled aside two crews of firefighters that had been working for companies contracted to help fight the Washington fire. The Bear Gulch Fire, spreading through rugged terrain in and around Olympic National Park, has burned nearly 9,000 acres.
“They were told they were going to cut firewood,” said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, a nonprofit industry group. “The people that were supposed to meet them never showed up, and eventually immigration showed up instead.”
Many contract crews rely heavily on immigrant labor.
“[Immigrants] make up a huge portion of forestry and fire, they’re an integral part of this industry,” Polhamus said.
Now, wildland fire veterans fear that the immigrants who have been protecting communities from fires could make fire camps a target for immigration officials who are trying to meet deportation quotes. And more high-profile raids on fire crews could cause many in the workforce to reconsider their profession.
“If you’re a migrant worker and this starts happening, are you going to keep on doing that and risk getting picked up?” Scopa said. “If [immigration authorities] keep visiting fire camps, we will definitely have fewer contract crews.”
In a news release, U.S. Border Patrol said the operation was the result of an investigation by the federal Bureau of Land Management. Federal agents, the release said, found discrepancies on the rosters provided by contract fire companies. Immigration officers arrested two people who were in the country illegally, the release said, while removing 42 additional firefighters from the fire scene. The release said the government has terminated its contracts with the companies.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., a member of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates, was one of the companies whose workers were checked, Polhamus said. The company was able to show that its firefighters all had legal H-2B visas, he said, which allow foreign nationals to fill temporary, nonagricultural jobs. Still, the company’s crew was demobilized and sent home, which he said was allegedly due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet. The company has not yet gotten official word from the feds about its contract, Polhamus said.

Neither Table Rock Forestry nor the other company targeted by the raid responded to requests for comment.
The Border Patrol statement said the operation did not interfere with firefighting operations. Tom Stokesberry, public information officer with California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, which oversaw the fire crews until Thursday, said the team was aware of the Border Patrol raid. Incident management teams deploy across the country to help coordinate the response to large fires. He would not comment on whether the raid affected wildfire operations.
Polhamus, along with many others in the wildland firefighter community, said it is widely believed that the same incident management team called immigration authorities to investigate another Hispanic crew last year. The raid this week took place on the California team’s last day in charge of the fire, hours before a Washington team took command.
While most fire crews with government agencies hire only U.S. citizens, officials also contract with private companies to help fight many wildfires. Those companies often hire workers on H-2B visas or immigrants who are working to earn their U.S. citizenship.
The effects of workers being detained could go well beyond those individuals, experts said. If a crew loses two or three members, it may no longer meet the specifications it needs to fulfill its contract. That could result in the entire crew being grounded — without pay — until replacements arrive.
“We utilize thousands and thousands of contract firefighters,” Scopa said. “It absolutely could impact our ability to manage fires if we’re losing crews.”
While firefighting contracting companies have varying opinions on the hiring of workers without legal status, Polhamus said, there’s consensus throughout the industry that conducting an immigration raid at the scene of an active wildfire was dangerous and irresponsible.
Washington Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove, who heads the state’s lead wildfire response agency, issued a statement that the state is still gathering details on the Border Patrol operation.
“[T]he Trump administration’s crude and inhumane approach to immigration enforcement has intentionally and unnecessarily stoked fear and mistrust among members of the public —including firefighters putting their lives on the line to protect our State,” he said in the statement.

(Photo by Julia Shumway/Oregon Capital Chronicle)The Oregon Parks and Recreation Department is implementing new fees at some of its day-use parks and raising fees for some of its busiest overnight camping parks.
The state waives day-use parking fees at more than 225 of its state parks, with only 25 parks charging the $10 fee for in-state visitors and $12 for people visiting from out of state. But on Oct. 1, the department will begin requiring the parking fee at an additional 21 of its day-use parks, including:

Beverly Beach State Park
Bullards Beach State Park
Cline Falls State Scenic Viewpoint
Crown Point State Scenic Corridor
Dexter State Recreation Site
Face Rock State Park
Farewell Bend State Recreation Area
Fort Stevens State Park
Harris Beach State Recreation Site
Hat Rock State Park

Lowell State Recreation Site
Oswald West State Park
Prineville Reservoir State Park
South Beach State Park
Starvation Creek State Park
Sunset Bay State Park
Tolovana Beach State Recreation Site
Tryon Creek State Natural Area
Valley of the Rogue State Recreation Area

The fees won’t apply to visitors who walk, bike, use public transportation or have a valid 12- to 24-month parking permit from Oregon State Parks.
These parks are some of the busiest parks in the system, according to a news release from the department. For example, Harris Beach State Park experienced an estimated 2 million day-use visits in 2024.
The changes are meant to supplement a 14% budget shortfall because of increasing costs, record visitation and a reduction in lottery funds for operations. The fee adjustments, along with internal efforts to reduce costs, will help maintain current service levels and ensure the system remains accessible in the future, the department said in the release.
Trump administration advances plan to reverse federal rule that limits logging in national forests

The park system raised day-use fees from $5 to $10 at the start of 2025, its first increase in 15 years.
Lottery funds cover a little less than half of Oregon State Parks’ budget, followed by 15% from recreational vehicle license plate fees and 35% from park fees from visitors.
“State parks are some of the most beloved spaces in Oregon, but we have struggled as a state to sustainably fund them,” Oregon Parks and Recreation Department Director Lisa Sumption said in the news release. “We’re working to reimagine the future of Oregon State Parks as a financially resilient system that will serve generations to come.”
The department is also increasing overnight rates at 29 of its busiest parks starting May 2025 to $29 a night for tents and $52 for full RV hook-ups. The rate change will apply from May 1 to Sept. 30 and apply year-round on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

 To save on parking, Oregon State Parks offers a 12-month parking permit for $30 and a 24-month permit for $50.

The parks include:

Alfred A. Loeb State Park
Ainsworth State Park
Beachside State Recreation Site
Beverly Beach State Park
Bullards Beach State Park
Cape Blanco State Park
Cape Lookout State Park
Carl. G. Washburne Memorial State Park
Champoeg State Heritage Area

Oregon State Parks will also increase all its cabin and yurt prices to a range between $72 to $129 a night, boat moorage fees will increase from $15 to $20 and overnight parking and overflow camping and primitive camping fees will increase from $10 to at least $15 a night.

(Photo by Barry Brecheisen/Getty Images for American Foundation for Suicide Prevention)On July 17, the option shut down for LGBTQ+ youth to access specialized mental health support from the national 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said a month earlier that it would no longer “silo” services and would instead “focus on serving all help seekers.” That meant the elimination of the “Press 3” option, the dedicated line answered by staff specifically trained to handle LGBTQ+ youth facing mental health issues ranging from anxiety to thoughts of suicide.

If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting “988.”

Now, states such as California, Colorado, Illinois and Nevada are scrambling to backfill LGBTQ+ crisis support through training, fees and other initiatives in response to what advocates say is the Trump administration’s hostile stance toward this group. In his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump issued an executive order recognizing only two sexes, male and female, and while campaigning, he condemned gender ideology as “toxic poison.” And the administration omitted “T” for transgender and “Q” for queer or questioning in announcing the elimination of the 988 Press 3 option.
“Since the election, we’ve seen a clear increase in young people feeling devalued, erased, uncertain about their future, and seeing resources taken away,” said Becca Nordeen, senior vice president of crisis intervention at The Trevor Project, a national suicide prevention and crisis intervention nonprofit for LGBTQ+ youth.
Nordeen and other advocates for at-risk kids who helped staff the dedicated line said it has never been more critical for what The Trevor Project estimates are 5.2 million LGBTQ+ people ages 13-24 across the U.S. About 39% of LGBTQ+ young people seriously consider attempting suicide each year, including roughly half of transgender and nonbinary young people, according to a 2023 survey, reflecting a disproportionately high rate of risk.
The use of the dedicated line for LGBTQ+ youth had steadily increased, according to data from the federal substance abuse agency, with nearly 1.6 million calls, texts or online chats since its rollout in October 2022, out of approximately 16.7 million contacts to the general line. The Press 3 option reached record monthly highs in May and June. In 2024, contacts to the line peaked in November, the month of the election.
Call-takers on the general 988 line do not necessarily have the specialized training that the staff on the Press 3 line had, causing fear among LGBTQ+ advocates that they don’t have the right context or language to support youth experiencing crises related to sexuality and gender.
“If a counselor doesn’t know what the concept of coming out is, or being outed, or the increased likelihood of family rejection and how those bring stressors and anxiety, it can inadvertently prevent the trust from being immediately built,” said Mark Henson, The Trevor Project’s interim vice president of advocacy and government affairs, adding that creating that trust at the beginning of calls was a critical “bridge for a youth in crisis to go forward.”

The White House’s Office of Management and Budget did not immediately respond to questions about why the Press 3 option was shut down, but spokesperson Rachel Cauley told NBC News that the department’s budget would not “grant taxpayer money to a chat service where children are encouraged to embrace radical gender ideology by ‘counselors’ without consent or knowledge of their parents.”
Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement: “Continued funding of the Press 3 option threatened to put the entire 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in danger of massive reductions in service.”
When someone calls 988, they are routed to a local crisis center if they are calling from a cellphone carrier that uses “georouting” — a process that routes calls based on approximate areas — unless they select one of the specialized services offered through the national network. While the Press 3 option is officially no longer part of that menu of options, which includes Spanish-language and veterans’ services, states can step in to increase training for their local crisis centers or establish their own options for specialized services.
California is among the states attempting to fill the new service gap, with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office announcing a partnership with The Trevor Project to provide training on LGBTQ+ youth issues for the crisis counselors in the state who answer calls to the general 988 crisis line. The state signed a $700,000 contract with the organization for the training program.
The Trevor Project’s Henson said the details still need to be figured out, including evaluating the training needs of California’s current 988 counselors. The partnership comes as the organization’s own 24/7 crisis line for LGBTQ+ youth faces a crisis of its own: The Trevor Project was one of several providers paid by the federal government to staff the Press 3 option, and the elimination of the service cut the organization’s capacity significantly, according to Henson.
Gordon Coombes, director of Colorado’s 988 hotline, said staff there are increasing outreach to let the public know that the general 988 service hasn’t gone away, even with the loss of the Press 3 option, and that its call-takers welcome calls from the LGBTQ+ population. Staff are promoting services at concerts, community events and Rockies baseball games.
Coombes said the Colorado Behavioral Health Administration contracts with Solari Crisis & Human Services to answer 988 calls, and that the training had already been equipping call-takers on the general line to support LGBTQ+ young people.
The state supports the 988 services via a 7-cent annual fee on cellphone lines. Coombes said the department requested an increase in the fee to bolster its services. While the additional funds would benefit all 988 operations, the request was made in part because of the elimination of the Press 3 option, he said.

Nevada plans to ensure that all 988 crisis counselors get training on working with LGBTQ+ callers, according to state health department spokesperson Daniel Vezmar. Vezmar said Nevada’s $50 million investment in a new call center last November would help increase call capacity, and that the state’s Division of Public and Behavioral Health would monitor the impact of the closure of the Press 3 option and make changes as needed.
The Illinois Department of Human Services announced after the Press 3 option’s termination that it was working to train existing call center counselors on supporting LGBTQ+ youth and promoting related affirming messages and imagery in its outreach about the 988 line. A July increase in a state telecommunications tax will help fund expanded efforts, and the agency is exploring additional financial options to fill in the new gap.
Kelly Crosbie, director of North Carolina’s Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Use Services, said the division has recently invested in partnerships with community organizations to increase mental health support for marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ populations, through the state’s 988 call center and other programs.
“We’ve wanted to make sure we were beefing up the services,” Crosbie said, noting that North Carolina’s Republican legislature continues to restrict health care for transgender youth.
Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said Congress could put the funding for the LGBTQ+ line in any final appropriations bill it passes. She also said states could individually codify permanent funding for an LGBTQ+ option, the way Washington state has created and funded a “Press 4” option for its Native American population to reach crisis counselors who are tribal members or descendants trained in cultural practices. The state created the option by carving out some of its 988 funding. No state has publicly announced a plan to make such an investment for LGBTQ+ populations.
Federal lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have spoken out against the closure of the LGBTQ+ 988 option and urged that it be reinstated. At a July press conference alongside Democratic colleagues, Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican who represents part of New York’s Hudson Valley, said he and Republican Rep. Young Kim of Orange County, California, wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., urging him to reverse course and keep the LGBTQ+ line.
“What we must agree on is that when a child is in crisis — when they are alone, when they are afraid, when they are unsure of where to turn to, when they are contemplating suicide — they need access to help right away,” Lawler said. “Regardless of where you stand on these issues, as Americans, as people, we must all agree there is purpose and worth to each and every life.”

(Photo Courtesy of the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation)It was the deadliest massacre of indigenous people in U.S. history. But today, many still don’t know the story.
It was 1863, on an icy January morning, at dawn. Hundreds of members of the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation were sleeping where they had settled for the winter along the Bear River, or as they call it, “Wuda Ogwa.”
The Shoshone Nation were a nomadic tribe, but every winter they would make this place their home, near what’s now known as Preston, Idaho. There, they’d fish for trout and hunt game birds. Hot springs nearby warmed the ground, heating their tepees and lodges, and giving their horses a place to graze in an otherwise frost-bitten landscape.
But that day, the tribe was nearly entirely wiped out.
U.S. military soldiers — led by Col. Patrick Edward Connor — set out from Ft. Douglas, Utah, toward Chief Bear Hunter’s camp, reportedly in retaliation for Shoshoni raids. The soldiers killed an estimated 300, including women and children, according to historians, though tribal leaders say it was more, closer to 500. Connor reported his troops counted 224 bodies, destroyed more than 70 lodges, seized 175 horses, and captured 160 women and children, according to National Park Service records.
Though they were few, some of the Northwestern Band survived. Today, their descendants are working to reclaim the site of the massacre as their home — and restore its natural ecosystem.
“This is a graveyard. This is our Arlington Cemetery,” Brad Parry, vice chairman of the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation’s tribal council, said in a PBS documentary about the tribe’s restoration project. “This is where our people had to fight for their freedom to exist.”



“I want to take this land back in time, to when it was wild,” Parry continues. “And restore our connection to it.”
 Tribal leaders want to turn their grief into healing

Parry and other tribal leaders held a forum Wednesday at the Northwestern Band’s tribal office in Ogden, Utah, to share the massacre’s history — and also share how the tribe is working to restore the land.
There, Parry told a room of more than 140 people that his grandmother, Mae Timbimboo Parry, learned about the massacre directly from her grandfather, Yeager Timbimboo, who was about 12 years old when the attack happened. To survive, he hid among dead bodies.
“He laid on the frozen ground, playing dead,” Parry said. “A soldier saw him playing dead, raised his rifle at him three times, but didn’t shoot.”
Now, more than 160 years later, Parry is leading the effort to give the site of the massacre new life. Though its history is fraught with horrific bloodshed, Parry told Utah News Dispatch that tribal leaders want to turn their grief into healing.
“We’ve wallowed long enough. We’ve been sad long enough. This has been detrimental long enough. Let’s flip the script,” he said. “Let’s take it back to what our ancestors would recognize and start bringing the community back to the land. And not just indigenous communities, but all communities.”

Since the Bear River Massacre, the Northwestern Band hasn’t had any land to call home. Their tribe was never given a reservation.
But in 2018, the tribe purchased about 350 acres of land around the massacre site. Their goal, Parry said, is to restore it to its wild, natural state, and to help the river’s ecosystem thrive.
And because all things in nature are connected — what happens in one ecosystem can affect another — the efforts to restore that section of the Bear River can have a cascading effect on a downstream neighbor that’s in dire need.

 How the Wuda Ogwa restoration could bring more water to the Great Salt Lake

The Bear River is the largest tributary of the Great Salt Lake, which has been shrinking to dangerously low levels due to drought, climate change and water diversion for agriculture and development. Today, the lake remains on the brink of ecological collapse.
The drying Great Salt Lake poses an existential threat to not only the wildlife that rely on its waters and wetlands, but also to people. Less water means more exposed lake bed, leading to dust storms laced with cancer-causing carcinogens like arsenic. In Utah, leaders are all in agreement — for the sake of Utah’s future, the Great Salt Lake must be saved.
And the Wuda Ogwa restoration project could play a part.

Tribal leaders say researchers’ models have predicted that the restoration of Bear River natural habitats could help send an estimated 13,000 acre-feet of water to the Great Salt Lake a year by ripping out water-sucking invasive plants and replacing them with native plants, cleaning out creeks, and restoring old agricultural fields to wetlands.
 

 This article is published through the Great Salt Lake Collaborative, a solutions journalism initiative that partners news, education and media organizations to help inform people about the plight of the Great Salt Lake — and what can be done to make a difference before it is too late.



The Great Salt Lake needs every drop of water it can get, so that amount of water isn’t insignificant — but it would far from solve the lake’s crisis. It needs about 8 to 15 more vertical feet of water (the equivalent of two Bear Lakes) to be healthy, according to the Great Salt Lake Collaborative.
And whether that water will actually flow all the way to the Great Salt Lake is still an open question. The tribe has secured water rights for the project, Parry said, but because it crosses state lines, tribal leaders have encountered challenges from leaders in Idaho during water rights adjudication discussions.
“One of the biggest problems that we’ve found is the state above you — their users don’t care about the Great Salt Lake,” Parry said. “I can say that because we’ve been involved in adjudication, and instead of asking how they can protect their water rights, (they ask), ‘Are you guys doing this for the Great Salt Lake?’”
Asked to clarify those comments, Parry told Utah News Dispatch that in talking with Idaho state officials and irrigation farming districts in Idaho, “their goal isn’t to help us save the Great Salt Lake.”
Parry said the tribe has its own, primary reasons for wanting to restore the land and the wetlands — but the benefits to the Great Salt Lake would be a positive consequence of the restoration that the tribe also supports.
He added that tribal leaders have found that the further away from the Great Salt Lake, there’s less interest in helping save it. But he argued “we’re all in this together,” and the impacts from toxic dust from the dried lake bed would be far-reaching, including potentially in other states like Idaho.
“If the states don’t start working with each other, it’s never going to happen,” he said.
 The Wuda Ogwa restoration project

Parry said the tribe has secured roughly $13 million in various state and federal grants and other funding sources for the river restoration project.
During Wednesday’s forum, tribal leaders and researchers detailed how after the Bear River Massacre, colonial settlement transformed what was once the Bear River’s natural bends and wetlands into farm and grazing land. Since then, it has become a shadow of what it once was.
Now, thanks to the help of volunteers on weeding and planting days, the tribe is working to remove invasive plants and replace them with native vegetation. They’re also working with engineers and biologists to reshape the river and its wetlands to a more natural state to help attract back fish, birds and other wildlife.

One of the biggest foes they’re working to root out is the Russian Olive. The thorny, invasive tree that sucks up massive amounts of water has taken over the river shoreline.
Brian Andrew, an engineer at the firm Hansen Allen and Luce that’s been hired by the tribe for the project, said there are an estimated 400,000 Russian Olive plants on a 60-acre area of the site. A mature Russian Olive tree consumes an estimated 75 gallons of water a day and crowds out other native plants like willows and cottonwoods.
Early in the project, Parry said tribal leaders envisioned building a geothermal heated amphitheater and cultural interpretative center. But he said the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted funding, and construction costs have since skyrocketed.
Now, Parry said the tribe is focused on restoring the land first and foremost, now envisioning a trail system as a way for members of the public to experience the wetlands once they’re thriving.
So far, the tribe’s partners estimate they’ve planted and seeded about 69,000 native plants over 111 acres. Between 2025 and 2027, they expect to plant an additional 130,000 over 250 acres.
Parry said with $13 million in funding that’s already been secured, they’ve made good progress — but he said tribal leaders continue to ask for donations since “we’re always looking for funding,” especially for monitoring the project’s impact on the ecosystem.
“Another $5 to $10 million wouldn’t hurt,” he said.

To read more about the project, click here.

It’s a familiar and daunting headline: Mississippi is bleeding talent. Our best and brightest—our  kids, our neighbors, our future—are leaving for cities and states that seem more alive, more  prosperous, more like the opportunity they are seeking.
According to data from the Mississippi  Institutions of Higher Learning and Mississippi State University’s National Strategic Planning and Analysis Research Center (NSPARC), just 52% of our public university graduates are working in the state three years after earning their degrees and that number drops to 49% by year five. U.S. Census data shows we have lost more than 60,000 millennials, in a state of about 3 million, since 2010.  
We’ve seen education reform, workforce programs and tax breaks, but we’re overlooking a game-changer right under our noses: tourism. It’s not just about visitors, but the quality of place and community tourism creates when done well. As one of Mississippi’s largest industries, tourism sparks entrepreneurship, creates vibrant communities and fosters pride of place. In short, it is one of our most effective yet underrecognized tools to retain and attract talent. It gives young people a reason to stay and a story worth telling.

I have seen firsthand how tourism can transform communities. I have watched a blues festival fill the air with music and the sidewalks with locals and visitors from around the world. Restaurants were packed, shops were busy and a once-quiet downtown was bustling. The festival wasn’t just an event. It was proof that a place once written off as “dying” could reinvent itself as a cultural  destination.  
Mississippi is rich with genuine, generous people who are the heart of our great state. Tourism, along with programs like Main Street, has been steadily developing communities worthy of our  people. This work lays the foundation for attracting residents who want professional opportunity, quality of life and a sense of belonging.  
Tourism’s role in reversing brain drain 
Brain drain is not just about jobs. Young professionals want more than a paycheck. They want communities with character, cultural vibrancy and opportunities to connect. Tourism  development builds these qualities. 
When a town invests in assets like music, food, outdoor recreation and historic preservation, it is  also investing in things that enrich life for residents. A hiking trail attracts tourists and gives locals a place to connect with nature. A festival fills hotels and creates experiences for the people who live there. A revitalized downtown becomes a place where residents want to shop, work and open businesses. 
In discussing future plans with my millennial niece who lives out of state, I asked if she would ever consider moving back home. She said the lack of outdoor recreation opportunities was one of the main reasons she planned to stay where she was. As a Gen Xer, this surprised me as we followed jobs and built our lives around them. She is mapping her future around lifestyle amenities that are important to her.
As a tourism leader, her response was a gut punch, and it solidified how crucial it is to invest in quality-of-life assets if we want the next generation to live here. Mississippi has incredible natural resources, but we often lag behind other states in developing outdoor amenities that are accessible to visitors and residents. 
Tourism doesn’t just create jobs and revenue; it creates reasons to stay. 
A powerful economic engine in plain sight 
In 2023, Mississippi welcomed a record 43.7 million visitors, generating $17.5 billion in cash-in hand economic development. Those dollars don’t just fill hotel rooms; they fuel small  businesses.

Tourism shapes Mississippi’s story 
If we want to keep and bring back our best and brightest, we must leverage tourism to own and amplify our story.  
For too long, much of the national narrative about Mississippi has been written by people who have never lived here. In 2019, state leaders created a dedicated funding model for tourism marketing, allowing Mississippi tourism to finally compete regionally and nationally. That investment has driven growth in GDP, tax revenue and economic development, but I believe our  best is yet to come.

Longwoods International conducted a study on the “Halo Effect” of tourism marketing. The study found that when people saw tourism ads and then visited a destination, their perception of that place improved dramatically across key economic indicators. Tourism leaders have long understood this connection, but the data confirmed that tourism directly influences how places are viewed as desirable locations to live, work and invest. 
For Mississippi, this means our festivals, coastal trails and warm hospitality can rewrite outdated perceptions. Tourism doesn’t just bring revenue; it builds pride and possibility. 
The front door to economic growth and development 
In economic development, talent attraction is a constant priority. States invest heavily in courting companies and industries, but these efforts work best when paired with a thriving tourism sector. 
No one moves or invests without first visiting.
It all starts with a visit, and the visit starts with us. Tourism is often the first impression Mississippi makes with future residents, business owners and investors. A positive visitor experience can plant the seed for relocation, business expansion, or a decision to return home. 
A call to action 
If we are serious about tackling brain drain, we must stop seeing tourism as “just” a leisure industry, but rather a strategic tool for workforce retention, talent attraction and community revitalization. 
That means closer collaboration between tourism leaders, economic developers and  policymakers. It means aligning strategies, sharing data and recognizing that investments in tourism infrastructure like improved public spaces and preservation of historic sites are also investments in our future workforce. 
I think of my niece every time I pass a quiet river or empty downtown. She is not just one person; she is a generation we risk losing. But I have seen what tourism can do. It can turn a  quiet downtown into a bustling main street, give a young person a reason to build their life here and change how the world sees Mississippi. This transformation is real and the result of intentional efforts by community champions. 
Mississippi’s story is ours to write. At a time when we are competing globally for visitors and people, tourism may be one of our most powerful and untapped tools to write our story in a way that keeps our homegrown talent and welcomes new Mississippians.

(Photo courtesy of CDC) Since the late 1960s, researchers at Iowa State University documented and studied mosquito species, diseases and population trends in Iowa. Data for 2025 show mosquito populations have remained high this summer. 
Ryan Smith, an associate professor at ISU and director of the Iowa Mosquito Surveillance, said there are more “nuisance” mosquitoes, or the type that like to bite an exposed ankle at an evening barbecue, persisting into the beginning of fall because of the heavy rainfall Iowa saw in July.
Smith explained that of the approximately 56 types of mosquitoes in Iowa, the majority tend to be the nuisance variety that, while annoying, are not the type of mosquitoes carrying diseases like West Nile virus. These nuisance varieties, he said, are also “really influenced” by rainfall. 
 Mosquito population trends in 2024 vs 2025. May = weeks 20-22, June = 23-26, July = 27-30, August = 31-35, September = 36-39, and the beginning of October =40. (Graph courtesy of Iowa Mosquito Surveillance)
West Nile virus 
West Nile virus, which is the primary mosquito-borne disease in the country according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is carried by Colex species of mosquitoes. 
Smith said the lab at ISU has observed there are fewer Colex mosquitoes this year, but the prevalence of West Nile virus in that population is at a “really high level.” 


Symptoms of West Nile virus: 
Most infected individuals do not develop symptoms, but those that do, can develop mild symptoms like a fever, headache, stiffness or vomiting. Neck stiffness, high fever, confusion, muscle weakness or tremors can be a sign of severe illness from the virus, which can affect the central nervous system. Individuals with these symptoms should see a doctor, according to the CDC. 
In the U.S. approximately 1,200 develop severe illness and approximately 120 people die from West Nile virus annually. 


Already, Iowa has observed one case of West Nile virus this year. Iowa Department of Health and Human Services reported Aug. 14, the infected individual was in their early 40s and from northern Iowa. 
Neighboring states, like Minnesota, South Dakota and Nebraska, already have between 15 and 25 cases each, according to CDC data. 
According to Iowa HHS, 21 Iowans were diagnosed in 2024 and one death was associated with the virus.
Late August and early September is typically when the number of infected individuals peaks.
“It’s important to remind people to stay vigilant … especially outside in the evening, when these Culex mosquitoes are typically the most active,” Smith said. 
Preventive measures can include removing standing water from around a home or backyard, wearing insect repellants that contain DEET or wearing long-sleeved shirts, pants and socks when outdoors in the evenings. 
Mosquito data 
Iowa Mosquito Surveillance sends out traps to various partners, like parks and recreation staff or county public health departments, who are taught how to use the traps and then send them in to the lab, where Smith and his team analyze each trap. 
Smith said while it’s hard to compare data from year to year, based on several factors, this year has been an “above average” year compared to a 20-30 year average. 
Smith said when there are instances of heavy rainfall, or flooding in areas, it can lead to stagnant water that mosquitoes can “can take advantage of” to “really thrive and amplify their population.”

The Iowa Mosquito Surveillance does more than provide a baseline of mosquito data for the state. Smith said it also helps inform public health entities that alert the public of potential mosquito-related risks and it can help municipalities decide if they’re going to spray for mosquitoes and how to manage the spray. 
Several cities across the state spray regularly for mosquitoes, but notably, the City of Des Moines stopped its spraying program this summer to save an estimated $300,000, according to reporting from Axios. 
The City of Des Moines said the decision was made due to budget constraints. The last spray it completed was at the beginning of May when it sprayed for mosquitoes in the larval stage. 
Smith said while he’s sure the decision not to spray leads to higher populations of mosquitoes in an area, there are too many other factors impacting mosquito populations to say definitively the city’s decision had an impact on Polk County mosquito populations.

(Photo courtesy of HARI)Rhode Island is losing doctors to Massachusetts. But it has successfully poached a leader from across the border to head the state’s health care trade organization.
The Hospital Association of Rhode Island named Michael Sroczynski as its new president effective Tuesday. Sroczynski has more than two decades of experience representing hospital and health care systems throughout the region, most recently as executive vice president for the Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association.
“Mike has a deep understanding of the current healthcare landscape and the multitude of challenges our local hospitals, health systems, providers, and patients are facing,” Mary Marran, president and chief operating officer of Butler Hospital and chair of the Hospital Association board of trustees. “His leadership will be immensely important as we work to build a better, even more innovative healthcare system for all Rhode Islanders.”
Sroczynski’s appointment fills the post last permanently held by Teresa Paiva Weed, a former Rhode Island Senate president, who retired in July 2024. Howard Dulude has been serving as interim association president since Paiva Weed stepped down.
Information about the search and selection process was not immediately available.
As association president, Sroczynski will lead the 17-member hospital and health care organization charged with advocating for health care services with state and federal leaders. As Rhode Island’s health care industry grapples with financial and workforce shortages and sweeping federal budget cuts, Sroczynski’s appointment comes at a “critical time of change and opportunity,” the Hospital Association said in a statement. His focus will include working with local health care facilities and provers to build their workforces and provide accessible and cost-effective care.
“Rhode Island is home to a special healthcare community with deep roots in our neighborhoods and even deeper ambitions for the future of patient care,” Sroczynski said in a statement. “I am honored to help uplift the voices of our hospitals and health systems at a time when provider voices are needed the most.”
At the Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association, Sroczynski helped oversee Massachusetts’ first-in-the-nation universal health care coverage law, along with “landmark” state policies in payment structure, workforce development and care coordination and the state COVID-19 response. Prior to his job with the Massachusetts health care association, he served as legislative counsel in the Massachusetts State Senate.
Sroczynski serves on the boards of the Professional Liability Foundation and the Massachusetts chapter of the Arthritis Foundation, and is a member of the New England Council’s health care committee. 
He is a graduate of Syracuse University’s Martin J. Whitman School of Management and College of Law.
A copy of his resume was not immediately available.

Kulpsville, Pennsylvania
Died Aug. 21, 2025
Sellersville, Pennsylvania
Details of services
Bob will be laid to rest with military honors at the Vermont Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Randolph, Vermont. The interment will be conducted privately, in accordance with the family’s wishes.

Robert L. Snyder, passed away on August 21, 2025, at the age of 77 in Sellersville, Pennsylvania. He was known to most as Bob and to some he was lovingly referred to as Bobby, Dad and Grampy.
Born in Kulpsville, PA, Bob was the son of Benjamin and Maude Snyder. He grew up in Towamencin Township and graduated from North Penn High School with the Class of 1967. Shortly thereafter, Bob answered the call to serve his country, enlisting in the United States Air Force in December 1967.
His distinguished military career spanned over twenty-six years, culminating in his retirement in 1993 with the rank of Senior Master Sergeant. After enlisting, Bob spent a year in Vietnam at Tan Son NHUT Air Base as part of the 377th Combat Support Group (PACAF) where he supported war efforts and the overall mission to provide the base with flying operations support, base defense, and act as an air liaison with members of the South Vietnamese Air Force. Bob also spent a required year of service doing a remote assignment away from his family in Iceland. He served with the 932d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron at Rockville Naval Installation, Iceland with a primary mission to monitor and detect all aircraft within the vast Icelandic air defense sector, spanning more than 250,000 square miles from the Atlantic Ocean to the North Sea. This mission was crucial during the Cold War years, particularly for early warning and airspace sovereignty against potential Soviet incursions.
After Vietnam, Bob was stationed at Hanscom AFB in Massachusetts where he met and later married Karen McCaffrey. Their union lasted from 1971-1998. Together they had one child, Nicole. Bob’s military career allowed the family to live in Okinawa as well as stateside in Montana, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Colorado, Illinois and lastly Vermont where the family put down roots and transitioned from military life to civilian life. The family was afforded many wonderful memories, experiences and opportunities due to Bob’s military service. Throughout his time in the Air Force, Bob earned numerous awards, medals and commendations for his dedication, leadership, and excellence which reflected his precision, and pride in every task.
Before retiring from the Air Force, Bob’s last assignment was serving as Wing Liaison between the United States Air Force and the Vermont Civil Air Patrol, a role he was able to continue after officially retiring from the Air Force in 1993 until he left Vermont in 1998.
Bob moved back to his home state of Pennsylvania and lived in Sellersville from 1998 until his death. During this time Bob continued to work, despite being retired, as a letter carrier and then school bus driver for the Penn Ridge School District until he fully retired in 2023.
Shortly after moving back to Pennsylvania, Bob got a second chance at love and met Marie Ferretti. They shared many years together as companions until she passed away in 2022.
Bob’s interests evolved over the years, but his competitive spirit, curiosity and enthusiasm never waned. Earlier in his life he actively played in military softball leagues, was an avid bowler and pool player. He enjoyed many outdoor activities such as fishing, camping and hunting. Later in life he enjoyed solving jigsaw puzzles, card games, tracking space and weather phenomena, reading, watching anything history related and cheering on his beloved Philadelphia Phillies and Eagles.
He is survived by his daughter Nicole Adams and her husband Chris of Essex Junction, VT, and his cherished granddaughter Katie Adams of Daytona Beach, FL. Bob also leaves behind his siblings: Donald Snyder, Denny Snyder (Sherry), Wayne Snyder (Debbie), Geri Drages (John), Kathy Basciano (Mike), and Barbara Feig. He also leaves behind his brother-in-law Richard McCaffrey, sisters-in-law Joann McCaffrey and Judy McCaffrey, many nieces and nephews and former spouse Karen Snyder.
Bob’s life was enriched by the love of his neighbors, the Groeber family—Scott, Jennifer, Ashley, and Jordan—and their dog Bentley.
Bob held a deep affection for Marie Ferretti’s children—Eric Ferretti (Denise), Dana Taylor (Jeff), and Nicole Umphred (John)—along with her grandchildren Nicholas, Jake, Brooke, Luca, Nico, and Rachel, whom Bob embraced as his own.
Bob was preceded in death by his parents, Benjamin and Maude Snyder; his mother- and father-in-law, Raymond and Adelaide McCaffrey; his brother Ben Snyder; his sister-in-law Carol Snyder; his brothers-in-law John McCaffrey, Dennis McCaffrey, and Bill Feig; and his beloved companion, Marie Ferretti.
To honor Bob’s memory, the family invites you to perform an act of kindness this coming Veteran’s Day, a gesture that reflects his service to our country and his generous spirit.
Bob will be laid to rest with military honors at the Vermont Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Randolph, Vermont. The interment will be conducted privately, in accordance with the family’s wishes.

Google is the most powerful search engine in the world, commanding nearly 90% of the global search engine market and generating over $348 billion in revenue last year. Over half of Americans say they trust Google more than their formal education.
But how does Google’s algorithm decide which results show up? And how do these results influence LGBTQ kids, their parents and Americans at large who are searching for help?
Uncloseted Media asked five Americans from around the country to Google five common queries related to LGBTQ identity, religion and parenting. The results were alarming and raised an urgent question: With nearly 40% of LGBTQ youth seriously considering suicide just last year, what happens when a queer teen or the parent of a gay kid in crisis turns to Google?

“I’m Christian, my daughter is a lesbian,” Melanie Brown, a Southern Baptist from High Point, North Carolina, types into Google.
When Brown presses enter, Bible Bulletin Board comes up as the third result, with the suggestion of “offering hope for change,” and “lead[ing] the way to the alternative to homosexuality.” It goes on to explain that “homosexuality is contrary to God’s Word. It is sin and as always results in sin’s destructive effects on the individual and on those close to them.”

In the living room, Brown’s 15-year-old daughter Genna, with her dog on her lap, Googles “accurate information on gay kids and what to do.”

Focus on the Family (FOTF) is the first result. She clicks the link and lands on the platform of a hyper-religious organization known for promoting conversion therapy and labeling her sexuality as sinful.

The site, which presents itself as a reputable religious source, features a tab titled “Understanding Homosexuality” and a section under their resources for “Homosexuality.” It states: “[FOTF] is committed to upholding God’s design for the expression of human sexuality: a husband and wife in a marriage.”

It offers suggested reading on “redemption” from a gay lifestyle, along with 11 counseling resources aimed at changing sexual orientation, including The Alliance for Therapeutic Choice and Scientific Integrity, which guarantees “professional assistance … for persons who experience unwanted homosexual attractions.”
The language is intentionally padded, which means Genna and her mom—and many of the other millions of Christian parents of queer kids—may never know that Google led them to a Southern Poverty Law Center-designated anti-LGBTQ hate group. FOTF is known for its long-standing opposition to LGBTQ rights, for spreading anti-LGBTQ disinformation and for framing homosexuality and transgender identity as sinful and disordered.

In South Boston, Virginia, Tommy O’Neil Googles, “My daughter just came out as trans and I’m a Christian.” As a father of two, he wants what’s best for his kids. According to Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, Google’s second result, O’Neil should recognize that God doesn’t make mistakes when assigning sex and give sympathy for those who are indoctrinated in the “transgender cult.”
What O’Neil might not know is that this seminary made the list of Worst Campuses for LGBTQ students. And in 2016, it was granted an exemption to Title IX, allowing it to discriminate against LGBTQ students for religious reasons.
Thousands of miles away in Anchorage, Alaska, 38-year-old bisexual woman April Samberg Googles, “I am bisexual and have a husband who is Christian, am I going to hell?”
The third result is once again an article by FOTF that tells April that “same-sex-attracted strugglers” and “transgender and homosexual lust and behavior are wrong.”
In Cincinnati, 44-year-old Mark Just Googles, “accurate information on homosexual kids and what to do.” FOTF is the top search result.
“I don’t feel good about it,” Just told Uncloseted Media. “It’s disturbing because if there are people out there who want to accept and understand their children or loved ones, this is what they’re being pointed to.”
“[I feel] fear for the queer kids with Christian parents who will be seeing that and thinking it’s good advice, and sorrow for the kids with parents who already have,” says Genna Brown, who was a “self-loathing, suicidal kid” who thought God would punish her for being gay before she came out to her now accepting parents. “It’s pretty awful that this is what’s being pushed for advice. This has no doubt harmed people.”
 
Uncloseted Media also asked folks in Taiwan, Lebanon, China, Hong Kong, Canada and India to Google similar queries. All of them had FOTF turn up as a top search result.
 Why Does Google Allow This?



Google, like other search engines, compiles information and directs users to various websites by referencing the titles of web pages that it judges to be most reflective of what was searched.


“Google’s algorithm is notoriously a black box,” says Jesse Ringer, founder of Method and Metric, a search engine optimization (SEO) growth company. “That’s intentional to keep their competitive advantage.”
What we do know is that Google ranks search results by first crawling the web with an automated program called “spiders” to follow links from page to page and collect data.
It uses text matching to identify documents that it thinks are relevant to a query and then ranks them based on a combination of popularity, freshness, location and previous links clicked.
But for people searching for reliable information, its process can be problematic.
“Google doesn’t rank based on accuracy, but on popularity and query matching,” says Dirk Lewandowski, professor of information research and retrieval at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences. “This is based on clicks and a network of how many other links are directed to this website. … Of course, users click what is shown in the first position. So we have kind of a rich get richer.”
 How to Get a High Ranking

As websites with the highest rankings continue to receive more clicks, websites like FOTF can also employ other tactics to keep their prominent placement.
Backlinking—the process of having other web pages hyperlink back to your site—is one of the ways to maintain your high ranking.
“Backlinks are a big part of popularity. So the relationship between other websites linking to this source is a big part of Google’s algorithm,” says Ringer. “There are SEO businesses that build link farms so that the content of their clients can go higher. They create a network effect and they link to each other. It is not unreasonable to think that [FOTF] has hired either an SEO person or they’ve hired an external agency to contribute to that.”
 
According to Francesca Tripodi, assistant professor at the University of North Carolina School of Information and Library Science, ranking can also be gamed by matching keywords to content. Tripodi looked at the metadata of progressive and conservative companies and found that conservative content creators “are much better at doing this.”
“They are savvy at creating new sets of words and tagging their content with them,” she says. “That’s not something I’m seeing with progressive content creators.”
Tripodi says that not only does conservatism thrive online, it might be the only perspective returned.

“They are well-funded companies with large production budgets and effective digital marketing teams,” she wrote in a 2019 testimony about conservatism and Google searches. “This is why when you search for liberal phrases like ‘gender identity’ or ‘social justice’ the top returns … are conservative content creators.”
Google declined to speak on record with Uncloseted Media for this story.
 
In an email, a spokesperson said: “Like any search engine, Google indexes the content that’s available on the open web, relying on systems like keyword matching to surface relevant results. We are largely guided by local law when it comes to removing pages from search results.”
 What If It’s Harmful or Illegal?

The United States notoriously protects harmful or misleading content—including anti-LGBTQ hate speech—under the First Amendment.
“The situation in [other countries] is a bit different than in America,” Lewandowski says. “For instance, Holocaust denial is illegal in Germany. So Google bans these sites, but they don’t ban them in the U.S.”
Section 230 of the U.S. law protects Americans’ freedom of expression online by implying that we should all be responsible for our own actions and statements on the internet. This law largely takes legal pressure off of Google.
And in 2003, an Oklahoma court ruled that Google’s rankings are subjective opinions and thus constitutionally protected.
Google’s policies for tamping down on harmful content “don’t apply to web results.” Thus, there is little moderation on the web pages that pop up for Americans who use the search engine.
The spokesperson for Google says that “[they] hold themselves to a high standard when it comes to legal requirements to remove pages from Google search results” and that “they don’t remove web results except for child sexual abuse, highly personal information, spam, site owner requests, and valid legal requests.”
But according to the company, “determining whether content is illegal is not always a determination that Google is equipped to make.”
Tripodi says this might be why groups like FOTF are still showing up, even though conversion therapy is illegal in 23 states. She says these groups may have found a loophole in Google’s policy by “tricking” the search engine into thinking they are providing “resources” and not simply a recommendation for conversion therapy.





 What Can Google Do to Fix This?

“Google has a responsibility for what is coming up in their results because people trust [them],” says Lewandowski. “They think something is correct or accurate because it is number one in Google.”
Fifteen-year-old Genna Brown is one of the 85% of Americans who feel this way, according to a 2025 study.
“Isn’t the first result typically ranked most credible?” she says. “Because I typically trust the first result more.”
“It’s pretty concerning what comes up when you search for these things,” Ringer says. “There needs to be more done to educate the people who are doing the searches on understanding news and information.”
 
But vulnerable groups, like LGBTQ kids who are living in households where they are told they are going to hell and parents who are often confused and in crisis themselves, are being led by Google’s algorithm to believe that being queer is wrong.
“1000% yes, these results concern me,” says Genna Brown. “We’re talking about organizations that promote practices like conversion therapy, which is insane. … I wish there was some disclaimer. Like, ‘Google has determined this to be a subjective query. As such, we can’t verify the following results. Proceed with caution.’”
Tripodi says she thinks consumers are responsible for about 20% of the burden by researching and verifying the sources they learn from. But she agrees with Brown in that Google carries an ethical responsibility for the content it chooses to rank and promote.
“As a global corporation that gobbles up all other possibilities for information, Google has a responsibility to ensure that its content is accurate and not harmful,” Tripodi says. “[It’s their job] to ensure that the information that they surface is accurate and reliable because we know people trust that information.”

A private celebration of life will be held on Sunday, August 31, 2025, at 1:00 p.m. at his home on Lake Champlain.

Dr. Mark Eric Kruger, 80, of Beach Road in Colchester, passed peacefully in the early hours of Thursday, August 21, 2025, at McClure Miller Respite Home, following a long and courageous journey with health challenges.
Born on March 16, 1945, in Winooski, Vermont, he was the son of Karl and Claire (Gravel) Kruger. He graduated from Rice Memorial High School in 1963 and went on to live a life marked by service, scholarship, and devotion to family.
From 1968–1971, Eric proudly served his country as a Navigator in the United States Navy aboard the USS John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier. Following his service, he pursued his passion for education, earning a master’s degree in Special Education from Columbia University and later an Ed.D. in Special Education from Lehigh University.
Eric began his career as a special education teacher, where his compassion and commitment touched the lives of countless students. He later became a professor of Special Education at East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania, where he mentored future educators with the same dedication that defined his life’s work. Upon retirement, he returned to Vermont and cherished his days on Lake Champlain, where he found peace in the slower rhythm of the water and the company of those he loved.
A highlight of his academic career came when he was awarded a prestigious Fulbright Scholarship, which brought him to India as a Fulbright Professor. There, he shared his expertise in special education, helping to strengthen programs and support for children with disabilities, leaving a lasting impact that extended far beyond his home country.
He is survived by his children Kristin and her wife Luanne, Michael and his wife Stephanie, and Julie and her husband Henry; his beloved grandchildren Charlotte, Owen, and Gavin; his brothers Karl (Chip) and wife Anne, Steve and wife Carol, and Mike and wife Lynne; his sisters Kathy (Foff) and Anne and husband Dave, and numerous nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by his wife Monica and eldest son Stephen. He is also survived by his loving companion, Pat, with whom he shared several meaningful years.

President Trump broke that law by sending the National Guard to L.A., a federal judge rules.","In summary
A 19th Century law called the Posse Comitatus Act defines what the military can do on U.S. soil. President Trump broke that law by sending the National Guard to L.A., a federal judge rules.


President Donald Trump’s deployment of the military to Los Angeles violated federal laws and  his use of the armed forces must be heavily curtailed in California, a federal judge ruled today in a 52-page opinion that inveighed against the president’s belief that he has unchecked powers to send the military into U.S. cities.
“There were indeed protests in Los Angeles, and some individuals engaged in violence,” wrote Charles Breyer, the judge overseeing the trial. “Yet there was no rebellion, nor was civilian law enforcement unable to respond to the protests and enforce the law.”
The judge blocked the Trump administration from using the military to engage “arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation, or acting as informants, unless and until” the Trump administration presents valid constitutional or legal exceptions, Breyer wrote. But his own order won’t go into effect until Sept. 12.
Breyer’s ruling caps one phase of the legal saga over Trump’s use of the military in Los Angeles. It followed a three-day trial in August that featured about 10 hours of testimony from military personnel, cross-examinations and arguments from lawyers representing California and the federal government.
His order colors an increasingly tense legal environment nationally after Trump deployed National Guardsmen to Washington, D.C. — aided by several Republican governors — and has threatened to send troops to Oakland as well as Chicago and New York. 
Breyer’s decision follows closely the arguments California Attorney General Rob Bonta’s legal team made. They contended that the 700 U.S. Marines and 4,000 National Guardsmen that the Trump administration deployed to Southern California violated a 19th century law called the Posse Comitatus Act. It prohibits the military from engaging in law enforcement activity.Bonta stressed that point when asked about the case at a recent press conference. “There was a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, that the military was improperly on the ground in L.A., involved in civilian law enforcement, contrary to what the (Posse Comitatus Act) provides,” Bonta said. “They were involved in blockades and perimeter support and traffic enforcement and immigration enforcement.”Fewer than 300 National Guard troops remain in Los Angeles, though the Department of Defense issued a new activation order to deploy troops in California for another 90 days on Aug. 5. Trump deployed the military after protests in Los Angeles broke out against federal immigration sweeps.
California’s lawyers argued that by assisting federal immigration agents, the National Guard performed the law enforcement duties that federal statute — and Department of Defense guidance — prohibit. That guidance said armed forces cannot do the following: “Evidence collection; security functions; crowd and traffic control; and operating, manning, or staffing checkpoints.” California lawyers pointed to that language in their legal briefs.Federal Department of Justice attorneys contended that those actions don’t count as law enforcement. They also said California was wrong to sue over the Posse Comitatus Act in a civil court because that act is a criminal statute, not civil.
Military as a ‘national police force’
California lawyers also said in their briefs that the use of the National Guard in Los Angeles meant that soldiers could accompany any number of federal agencies enforcing the nation’s laws, such as food inspectors, medical fraud investigators or federal voting rights officials to “monitor” election polling places.
Breyer seemed persuaded by that argument. He wrote in his ruling that if the government’s rationale is that the military can assist law enforcement whenever there’s danger to officers, there’s no logical end to the military’s involvement, since law enforcement is inherently dangerous.
Breyer’s ruling echoed his questioning during the third day of the trial about the limits of military involvement. “So again, I go back to the thing that I’m really troubled by: Is what limiting factors are there to the use of this force” once the incident that required the troops’ presence is quelled, Breyer asked a federal attorney during last week’s trial. “How does one look at this national police force which goes out of where the threat was and starts executing other laws.” 
How often National Guard joined immigration agents
California lawyers showed during the trial that National Guard soldiers took part in over 60 operations with federal immigration law enforcement forces. The National Guard accompanied immigration law enforcement agents on roughly 75% of the agents’ missions between June and early July, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field director for Los Angeles testified. Guardsmen set up armed perimeters that blocked traffic and people, the lawyers said, and apprehended at least one protester.The troops also took part in a mission at MacArthur Park, a Los Angeles public park, that a government memo presented during the trial described as “demonstrating federal reach and presence.” 
The National Guardsmen arrived with Humvees and tactical vehicles. Other evidence from federal documents that California attorneys displayed showed that “current intelligence does not indicate a high value target or threat to federal functions at this location” and that there was “no indication that failure to act would result in a loss of life or significant property damage.” 
Is the National Guard subject to Posse Comitatus?
Another major question in the trial was whether the National Guard is covered by the Posse Comitatus Act even when the president uses an obscure law federalizing the troops.It is, Breyer wrote. “The Court will not take Defendants’ invitation to create a brand-new exception to the Posse Comitatus Act that nullifies the Act itself.”The federal government has argued that the National Guard isn’t bound by Posse Comitatus and can in fact execute the nation’s laws due to another law that permits the president to call up the National Guard in emergencies. That was a claim Breyer responded to skeptically during the trial.
“Why did I spend a day looking at slide after slide and regulation after regulation and reports after reports on conduct of the soldiers to ensure that they were in compliance with the Posse Comitatus Act. If that Posse Comitatus Act is irrelevant, why did that happen?” Breyer asked the federal government attorney during the trial.
“If the President wants to avoid the act’s restrictions, he must invoke a valid exception — like the Insurrection Act, along with its requisite showing that state and local law enforcement are unable or unwilling to act,” Breyer wrote.
A California lawyer, Meghan Strong, an attorney representing California, pointed to a June 16 Department of Defense action memo that she described as showing that using the National Guard to enforce laws “would be inconsistent with the Posse Comitatus Act.” That view was reaffirmed by William Harrington, the deputy chief of staff of Task Force 51, which is the military unit deployed to Los Angeles.“You said that if any National Guard troops were federalized as part of the deployment, they would lose the ability to conduct law enforcement activities, because of the Posse Comitatus Act,” Strong said to Harrington at the trial last Monday.“Correct,” Harrington replied. 
Lawyers for California said during the trial that the National Guard can still play a role in emergencies as long as it’s not law-enforcement in nature. Those include guarding federal buildings or even delivering the mail, as the National Guard did during the Nixon administration in 1970 while postal workers were on strike.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060825-Natl-Guard-MDC-DTLA-TS-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-02 12:00:11.154102

Springfield, Vermont
Died Aug. 23, 2025
Arcadia, California
Details of services
A memorial service in Peter’s honor held at 10:30 a.m., Friday, September 5, 2025 at San Marino Community Church, 1750 Virginia Road, San Marino, California.
In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in Peter’s name to Johnny’s school, Westmoreland Academy, a leader in special education in Southern California, with a unique program for students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Grounded in the belief that extraordinary students deserve an extraordinary program, Westmoreland Academy is essential to Johnny’s success.

Peter Hugh Sinclair(1975 – 2025)
Beloved husband, father, brother, and friend, Peter Sinclair passed away on August 23rd following a short but fierce battle with cancer. He was surrounded and embraced by his loving wife Kate, daughter Mary, son Johnny, sister Molly, and family, who supported him with courage and resilience through his illness.
Peter and Kate Sinclair met in Boston in 2004, and they were inseparable from the day they met. They shared a mutual sense of humor, a love of hiking, and passion for their sports teams, including the Dodgers and Red Sox. Their love only grew stronger through years of triumphs and challenges in the life that they built together. Anyone could see they were made for each other. Peter only had eyes for Kate— she was his sunshine.
Residents of San Marino, CA for the past 14 years, Peter is known in his community as “softball Dad.” Afternoons and weekends, he could be found on the practice field with Mary. Peter built a batting cage in their backyard, where they practiced early mornings and after dinner. Kate, Peter, and Mary explored remote towns of Southern California and beyond on weekends for away games, often leaving before dawn and returning after dark. Peter couldn’t have been prouder when Mary recently committed to play softball at Brown University, Class of 2030.
Peter was equally devoted to his son Johnny. Together with Kate, they helped Johnny navigate living with Autism. Although Johnny is non-verbal, Peter and Kate have learned to communicate with him in many other ways. The entire family often hiked and explored the hills of Malibu and mountains of La Cañada. On summer trips to Bass Lake, Peter and Johnny raced around the lake tubing and jet skiing. Through countless adventures together, from Death Valley to Mount Baldy, Big Bear, and Utah, Peter would often say that Johnny taught him more than anything he learned in the classroom.
Not only did the Sinclair’s form a great team, Peter was a role model for all the children in his life. Known by his nephew Jack and nieces Kate and Maddie as the “fun adult,” Peter always sat at the kids’ table at family dinners. Peter was an avid fan in the stands at Little League games, always cheering for the kids, both on and off the field.
Born in Springfield, Vermont, Peter loved the outdoors. The 1993 Vermont State Boys Alpine Champion, Peter also played soccer in high school and college. Peter was a student of all things, a curious and lifelong learner. He graduated from Williams College magna cum laude with a double major in philosophy and chemistry. Peter taught English in Tokyo and interned at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. A Harvard Law School graduate, he began his career in Boston at McKinsey & Co. Although friends, classmates, and co-workers referred to Peter as “the most intelligent of all of us,” Peter lived his life with humility, focused on friends and family.
During his career, Peter became a brilliant entrepreneur. He held leadership roles in companies that spanned pomegranate juice, flowers, event tickets, financial services, and ultimately, music. He left his executive role at Universal Music in Los Angeles to follow his dream and build a company to fund the dreams of artists and musicians. Peter co-founded beatBread in 2020 to empower artists to make a living from their music without giving up ownership of their work. As CEO of beatBread, Peter and his team have helped artists pave their way, with financial advances to give them freedom to do what they do best – create. In a recent article, Peter said, “What music can do – nothing else can. Other than comedy, I believe music is maybe the only medium that can really change someone’s mind about an important issue. This is something I’d be proud to tell my parents that I’m doing with my life. beatBread fits that bill for me. The team at beatBread are all trying to accomplish something beyond building a business… we’re all doing our best to make a positive dent in the world, where more musicians have more choice to make music on their own terms.”  
Peter made a positive dent in this world, and his impact is felt most profoundly by his family, who will miss him dearly. Peter is survived by his wife of 19 years, Kate Zaia Sinclair; daughter Mary Elizabeth Sinclair; son John Zaia Sinclair; sister Molly Sinclair and wife Rachel Piper; brother Jes Sinclair; mother-in-law Connie Zaia; sister-in-law Sarah Rome and husband Jason Rome; sister-in-law Brita Elise Zaia and partner Monica Rosa; nephew Jack Rome; nieces Kate and Madeline Rome. Peter is pre-deceased by his parents, John and Nancy Sinclair and father-in-law, John Zaia.

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)Olga still tears up when she recalls witnessing New Orleanians returning to the city in the months after Hurricane Katrina struck — only to find their homes destroyed.
“It made me sad to see other people suffer like that. … They were coming home and hoping that maybe they’d find some pieces of what they left behind and there would be nothing – nothing,” said Olga, a 63-year-old construction worker originally from Veracruz, Mexico, speaking through a translator earlier this month. “I think that vicarious trauma affected me a lot. … I did all I could to try to help those people.”
Olga — an undocumented immigrant who asked that her full name not be published — arrived in New Orleans in January 2006 hoping to find work. There was plenty to be found. Katrina had hit New Orleans just a few months earlier. The failure of the flood protection system that followed left 80 percent of the city underwater; entire neighborhoods were in ruins.
In the months after she arrived, Olga found jobs clearing out rotting furniture, deceased pets and damaged memories from people’s homes. She also worked on demolitions.
As crews began to rebuild, she excelled in installing wallboard and later in welding fences, she said.

Olga is one of thousands of workers from Central America and Mexico who came to the New Orleans metro region to rebuild after Hurricane Katrina’s destruction.
The influx of Latinx workers to New Orleans has largely been viewed as a net positive. Many residents say the reconstruction workers helped make it possible for them to return to their homes and get back their lives after the storm took so much away.
Hispanic residents represent one area of growth in an otherwise shrinking region. In the past two decades, the Hispanic population in the metro area grew by about 80,000 — going from 5% of the area population in 2000 to about 14% as of last year — adding to the local labor force, boosting local entrepreneurship and contributing to local tax revenues.
But the stability that many longtime undocumented residents and recently arrived immigrants have sought in Louisiana is now being threatened as the Trump administration, along with state and local authorities, cracks down on immigration.
New state laws and federal policies have increased information-sharing between the state and immigration enforcement agencies. Immigrants have been taken into federal custody and swiftly deported after showing up for routine ICE check-in appointments. ICE has conducted major worksite raids in New Orleans and Calcasieu Parish. And nearly two dozen local and state law enforcement agencies have inked partnership agreements with ICE, deputizing local officers to do the federal agency’s work.
Olga said the threat of detention and deportation feels “omnipresent” now.
“I think the greatest fear I’ve ever felt is this year,” Olga said. “You leave for work in the morning and you have no idea if you’re ever going to make it home.”

‘Leaving our families behind and risking our lives’
Reconstruction workers had different reasons to come to New Orleans after Katrina. For Olga, it was money. Her husband had walked out on her, and she had three kids to feed. So she took the journey to Texas, traveling by bus and foot to the U.S. border, then crossing the Rio Grande in a raft. Olga left behind two daughters, a son and her parents, planning to send money back to them in Mexico.
Once she crossed into Texas, near McAllen, she said, she had to hide from immigration authorities in a ditch. She then headed northeast on foot, walking for eight hours. She then put her trust in smugglers, known as “coyotes,” to get her to a safe place to stay. She rested there for a month before making her way to Louisiana.
Her first Louisiana home was in Hammond, about an hour outside New Orleans across Lake Pontchartrain. She shared the house, which lacked electricity, with a group of roughly 20 other workers – mostly men.
After 10- to-12-hour days working in construction, she and the only other woman living in the house were expected to cook for the crew. This is how it went for years, she said, moving from house to house with different crews. Now, Olga lives in Jefferson Parish – which has seen the largest growth in the region’s Latinx population in recent decades. She lives with her son, who joined her in the U.S. in 2014 and works alongside her on construction jobs, and her grandson.
Leticia Casildo, who came to New Orleans from Honduras in November 2005, came here seeking safety.
Back home, she worked as a police officer. In an interview Tuesday, Casildo said she was threatened after she reported corruption within the force. She and her husband fled, leaving behind their 2-year old daughter and 5-year old son in hopes that they would be able to send for them soon after. It would be eight years before they were reunited. By then Casildo and her husband were also raising their third child, a U.S. citizen.
Both Olga and Casildo cried when reminded of how their families were broken apart in their quests for stability in the U.S.
“My husband and I worked hard because we kept thinking, ‘I need my children. I need my children with me,’ all the time,” Casildo said.
Because of her status, Olga has never left the U.S. since crossing the border 20 years ago.. When her father died in 2009, she could not return home.
“[People] see us working, but a lot of people have no idea the suffering immigrants go through day in and day out,” Olga said. “We all have lived that same situation of leaving our families behind and risking our lives.”
Building community
The rebuilding work could be risky. To aid in rebuilding quickly, the Bush administration in September 2005 briefly suspended federal worksite inspection and enforcements in storm-affected areas.
Even though the regulations were quickly put back in place, the suspension of the laws had already “paved the way for exploitation of workers,” said Sarah Fouts, a University of Maryland, Baltimore County professor who provided support to workers in the 2010s as a volunteer with El Congreso de Jornaleros, or Congress of Day Laborers, a program of the now-splintered New Orleans Worker’s Center for Racial Justice.
Fouts’ recently published book, “Rebuilding New Orleans: Immigrant Laborers and Street Food Vendors In The Post-Katrina Era,” notes the “toxic conditions” and lack of protections for thousands of Central American and Mexican workers reconstructing the region.
“As day laborers worked relentlessly, they fell victim time and again to an unregulated job market, receiving little to no compensation or protections,” Fouts writes.
Olga said on multiple occasions, she and a crew she was working with would finish a job, only to be told that the homeowner refused to pay for the work.
In 2009, the Times-Picayune reported that El Congreso de Jornaleros and the Workers’ Center filed complaints against contractors and subcontractors for shorting laborers on pay.
Wage theft for immigrant construction workers in the United States persists as the threat of climate disasters intensifies – with reports of lost wages from laborers who helped rebuild after Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and Hurricane Ida in 2021.

Responding to challenges that the region’s immigrant community was facing, Casildo founded the nonprofit Familias Unidas en Accíon, or Families United in Action, in 2018. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the organization delivered food to undocumented immigrants who did not qualify for benefits. Familias Unidas has grown to operate other programs, including addressing labor rights issues.
Despite these challenges of poor living and working conditions and fighting for proper compensation, Olga said she never considered leaving New Orleans. She was determined to create opportunities for her family in Mexico. She said her work has paid for her children’s education. Her eldest daughter is now a biologist. Her other daughter is a sommelier, and her son earned a law degree before joining his mother in the U.S. She also paid for a house in Mexico, where her daughter and grandchildren live.
Others have become entrepreneurs.
In “Rebuilding New Orleans,” Fouts, who researches foodways, writes that food trucks, called loncheras, sprung up near popular day-laborer corners during the post-Katrina reconstruction era because workers needed affordable, familiar foods to fuel their long work days. Now, she said, it’s easy to see the impact that Hispanic immigrants have had on the New Orleans metro region by following the food.
“Maybe the people aren’t that visible, but the restaurants are so visible,” Fouts said.
In Mid-City, Fouts noted, food trucks selling Mexican tacos and Salvadoran pupusas line Broad Street, sitting near restaurants offering typical Honduran cuisine and three supermarkets serving Latinx customers – Norma’s Bakery on Bienville Street, La Morenita on Canal Street and Ideal Supermarket on Broad Street.
“If you have three Latin American grocery stores within a half a mile radius, that’s super visible,” Fouts said.
‘Your parents were heroes’
A few years after Hurricane Katrina, Dr. Juan Gershanik, who is originally from Argentina,  looked around New Orleans and noticed that — in a city filled with monuments to the past — there was little public recognition of the Latinx workers’ contributions to the post-Katrina recovery.
Gershanik is a pediatrician, not a construction worker, but he had made his own notable contribution to the city in the wake of the storm.
As the floodwaters rose, he worked with a team of people at Memorial Medical Center, now Ochsner Baptist, to safely transfer some of its most vulnerable patients – newborn babies in the neonatal intensive care unit being kept alive inside incubators –  to Baton Rouge. The team transported the incubators to a helipad on the hospital’s roof. Inside a supply helicopter, Gershanik helped the newborns to breathe by manually pumping oxygen from a portable tank. With the most vulnerable baby needing warmth, Gershanik placed the tiny child on his stomach – earning him the nickname “the Argentinian Kangaroo.”
In the years after Katrina when he and his wife, Ana, a journalist, began speaking with Hispanic students in a drug and alcohol awareness program, they noticed that the children of migrant recovery laborers appeared “ashamed” of their parents’ work, he said in a recent interview.
“I say, ‘What does your family do?’ And they start getting down in the face,” Gershanik said. “They were so, in a sense, ashamed that their parents were in what they called menial [jobs].”
“My husband and I said to them … ‘Without your parents, we would not have been able to go back to New Orleans,’” Ana Gershanik said. “Your parents were heroes.”
They decided then that there needed to be a physical monument honoring the Latin Americans that helped rebuild New Orleans.
“I wanted these children to be proud – to help their self-esteem,” Juan Gershanik said.
The Gershaniks and their three children worked on the effort to bring the statue to life. They found an Italian sculptor, Franco Alessandrini, to build it.
Juan Gershanik wanted the sculpture to include a roof and ladder – things that pointed to the work that was done. Ana Gershanik worked to ensure that the people in the finished piece did not have European features, but instead were representative of the Central Americans and Mexicans that worked in New Orleans. And she said, there had to be women there because she remembered seeing women working alongside men on dusty construction sites.
“There were women everywhere,” Ana Gershanik said.
In November 2018, the monument was unveiled inside Crescent Park, which runs along the Mississippi River, stretching from the Marigny neighborhood at the edge of the French Quarter to Bywater. The 26,000-pound sculpture featured workers – a man on a ladder, another on the roof of a house, a woman holding a broom.
After providing these contributions to New Orleans, immigrant workers “deserve the same treatment as anybody else who lives in this country,” Ana Gershanik said. She said that despite the threat of immigration detention and deportation, she believes recovery workers will continue to show up for U.S. communities after natural disasters.
Olga said she knows that she has made a positive impact on hundreds of people whose homes she’s worked on in the past two decades. She said of course she and other laborers deserve recognition, and they also deserve to live without fear.
“Don’t treat us as criminals. We are essential workers. We are hardworking people. We try and help the community rebuild, develop and flourish,” Olga said. “We’ve been here for you through all of this. … Help us to at least be able to live with certitude that will be able to make it home safely without being hunted down.”

Criminal defense lawyers say that’s because the state is intentionally deprioritizing much-needed changes, citing the lack of legislative action, as well as the underfunding of the public defender system, and an appeal filed by the state earlier this year seeking to block the temporary release of indigent defendants until they are provided legal representation.
Of the more than 35 bills related to indigent defense that the Legislature considered this session, only five became law. Gov. Janet Mills signed two of the bills while three more became law without her signature. Four additional bills were enacted by the Legislature but held by Mills to either veto within the first three days of the next session in January or let them become law without her signature. 
The governor vetoed one bill that aimed to clarify when an indigent defendant is entitled to counsel at the state’s expense. The laws that did pass, for the most part, did not enact any sweeping changes to the criminal justice system, three experts told the Maine Morning Star.
Meanwhile, there are still almost 300 people without attorneys as of August 27, almost 45 of whom are currently in jail, according to a Maine Morning Star analysis of court data.
“Overall, I would say it was a disappointing session. I understand, in light of the budget constraints everybody was under, that they felt they were limited in what they could do,” said Jim Billings, executive director of the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services.
“But what left an especially sour taste in our mouths after the session concluded was that there was $150 million left over that they had not calculated correctly,” he added, referring to the $152 million surplus that Maine ended with at the close of the fiscal year on June 30, “and despite having a civil rights lawsuit still pending and a court order saying we’re violating the U.S. Constitution, we received very little in the way of new resources.”
Billings announced last month that he would be stepping down from his post in October.
Some defense attorneys argued that Mills is partly the reason for the Legislature’s lack of progress and funding for the public defense system.
“We have a governor who, through her cohorts, has made it very clear that they are not going to support any real, true criminal legal reform. We have a Legislature that has not been able to address this issue, or will not address this issue,” said Tina Nadeau, executive director of the Maine Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. “So anything that could have a wide impact on the people that we serve … has not had any positive reception.”
Mills’ office denied this claim, touting the recent establishment of the state’s first public defender offices and increasing the commission budget from approximately $20 million to $45 million per year. In 2023, Mills also signed into law a raise for private attorneys that the commission contracts with from $80 to $150.
“Despite having significantly more money, the number of rostered attorneys has not increased to required levels, and the system continues to struggle to find lawyers to represent indigent defendants,” Mills’ spokesperson Ben Goodman said.
Insufficient funding persists
However, Maine’s public defender offices are new and the 33 employed public defenders can’t take on all the indigent defendants’ cases, so the bulk of cases are still contracted out to private criminal defense lawyers. There are between 35 and 50 rostered attorneys out of a list of 300 that take on a majority of cases, with others working for the commission part-time. Those lawyers charged about 325,000 total billable hours last year, which Billings said amounted to about $48 million — exceeding the annual budget allocated to the commission.
“They’re not facing the reality that for a time period, we’re going to be paying for two systems, so it’s costing us over $56 million this year for a partial public defender system,” he said. “It’s going to take some patience and some amount of time for the public defenders to start absorbing the billable hours that were all going to the rostered attorneys before we start to see some savings.”
Because of those costs, the commission will have no funds left to keep paying rostered attorneys for the last quarter of the fiscal year, starting April 2026, unless the Legislature approves an additional $13 million before then, Billings said. 
Those lawyers, which include Nadeau and Jim Howaniec, a longtime criminal defense lawyer and former mayor of Lewiston, are expecting major disruptions. 
“The rubber is going to hit the road come April 1, when people are still going to get arrested, but the criminal defense lawyers aren’t going to be paid,” Howaniec said.
Lawmakers on the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee were caught between two competing realities this session, said co-chair Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland): “The need for [Public Defense Services] to have additional funding and the lack of a surplus of resources for the Legislature to appropriate.”
Both Nadeau and Howaniec pointed out that the state also has $1.03 billion in the state’s Budget Stabilization Fund, also called the “rainy day fund,” which could be tapped for short-term relief. 
“The state of Maine has been sued for violating the Sixth Amendment. Is it not raining yet?” Nadeau asked.
Asked about the commission’s pending budget shortfall, the governor’s spokesperson said she would evaluate its budget and “work with the Legislature in the next legislative session to consider what needs may be reasonable —- and what the Commission itself can do — to continue to address this issue.”
“In the meantime, the Governor has said publicly that lawyers who represent indigent defendants should be confident they will be fully paid for their work,” Goodman added.
Goodman also cited Maine Superior Court Justice Michaela Murphy’s March 2025 order that said the public defender offices are not taking on enough cases despite being staffed. He also pointed to the governor’s suggestion that the commission remove limits on the number of cases that private contracted lawyers could take on.










We are building a long term solution and there is no quick fix to this.


– Jim Billings, executive director of the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services


However, Billings said in March there were only five public defenders responsible for training and taking on cases, and 1,000 defendants waiting for counsel. At that time, the offices were not fully operational with many positions still vacant, and there were many entry level and out-of-state attorneys with no Maine experience. 
“The state of Maine has simply not dedicated the necessary resources to solve this problem, and it cannot be fixed on the backs of five people,” he said. “We are building a long term solution and there is no quick fix to this.”
Legislative progress
One of the bills that became law without the governor’s signature this session, LD 1101 sponsored by Carney, funded eight new positions within the commission, five assistant defenders and three support staff. Carney said she hopes the law can support public defenders to take on cases that might be hard to find contracted defense lawyers for.
Michael Kebede, policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said it was “very good” that the Legislature was able to fund this bill “in a legislative session where funding was very scarce.” 
“These positions are primarily responsible for providing indigent legal services to criminal defendants and parties in child protective proceedings, and that’s essentially the source of the crisis,” Kebede said. “There aren’t enough such people, and so this bill just creates more of the jobs that we need to solve the indigent defense crisis.”
Billings, however, said while the law created the new positions, they were not ones that the commission had requested. He also criticized the provision allowing the judicial branch to appoint attorneys not vetted or supervised by the commission, which he said was a step backward.
Broader reforms lacking
Even with adequate funding, the lack of broader reforms to the criminal justice system, which would decrease the number of people requiring legal defense, remains an issue. Hundreds of defendants who can’t afford attorneys are still facing the consequences of a harsh criminal code, Nadeau and Howaniec said.
“The problems that I see in the court system are racial, they’re economic, they’re political, but the bottom line is, the amount of focus on ‘getting tough on crime’ is disproportionate to making sure that people have an adequate criminal defense system,” Howaniec said. 










The problems that I see in the court system are racial, they're economic, they're political, but the bottom line is, the amount of focus on ‘getting tough on crime’ is disproportionate to making sure that people have an adequate criminal defense system.


– Jim Howaniec, criminal defense attorney


Carney said lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee shared this concern. “We are prosecuting things as crimes that shouldn’t be crimes under Maine’s criminal code, and by doing so, we’re unduly burdening both the judicial system and also the defense services,” she said.
But most of the reforms that would change the criminal code were either rejected by the committee, or were carried over to the next session. 
Some of those include bills ensuring access to speedy trials for defendants, allowing people to be released on parole, decriminalizing small amounts of drug possession, limiting how many years younger people can be sentenced, diversifying the jury pool and getting rid of charges filed against someone out on bail who violates their conditions of release — Maine’s most common criminal charge.
That bill, LD 179 introduced by Rep. David Sinclair, an attorney from Bath, would have removed the crime of violating conditions of release. Maine is one of only six states with such a charge that serves as a separate class E crime, punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
In 2024 alone, there were over 5,400 such charges filed in Maine courts, Frayla Tarpinian, a former prosecutor who oversees Maine’s first public defender office, said in a statement to the committee. In comparison, she said the second most common type of charge was 662 cases of drug possession.
Sinclair told Maine Morning Star in February that he believed removing the separate charge for violating conditions or release would help alleviate the state’s indigent defense system. 
However, that bill was ultimately opposed by the committee. Carney said while some agreed with the principles underlying the proposal, arguments that such a charge is an important tool for protecting survivors of domestic violence ultimately swayed their vote.
A related bill, which was one of the only ones signed into law this year, allows prosecutors to determine whether to reduce certain class E crimes to civil violations.
Maine is far from alone in struggling to pass broader reforms, said Abbe Smith, a law professor and director of the Criminal Defense and Prisoner Advocacy Clinic at Georgetown University. 
“Everybody wants to be known as tough on crime, concerned about public safety, and I think opposition to commonsense reforms often plays on that fear of crime,” said Smith.
She added, “criminal defendants have no constituency. Nobody really cares about the quality of representation, except some lawyers and those who find themselves in the system.”
TIMELINE 
Indigent defense crisis in courts
Over the past few years, Maine’s indigent defense crisis has not substantially improved, with hundreds of people sitting in jail without attorneys over the years, Nadeau and Howaniec said. 
This January, the Kennebec County Superior Court ruled the state’s failure to provide timely counsel to defendants who can’t afford an attorney a constitutional crisis, and in March said the state must create a plan to address it.
Murphy, the judge, also agreed to consider releasing indigent defendants who have been jailed without legal counsel for at least 14 days, and to temporarily dismiss charges against defendants without representation for more than 60 days after their initial court appearance.
But the state appealed that decision and hearings on individual cases that could have started in June were paused until October when the case will go before the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. As a result, no defendants were released or had their charges temporarily dismissed, according to the ACLU. 
“It’s such a problem that the brakes have been completely pumped on the most fundamental remedy for this ongoing crisis of people not having representation,” Nadeau said. “The real violation, from the state’s perspective, is these folks would be getting away with something, and how dare they. Because the state doesn’t think the people who are without counsel deserve a remedy.”
Next steps
Several other reforms will be considered when the Legislature reconvenes in January.
These include LD 1941, which would reestablish parole, and LD 449, which proposes conditional discharge for certain defendants. 
Carney said she doesn’t know whether it is possible to make the changes proposed in LD 449 to the state criminal code, although it is “trying to get at that same concern that we’re spending more resources charging and prosecuting people than we need to spend in order to achieve the rehabilitative purpose of the criminal code.”
Another carried over bill that Carney said could improve judicial efficiency is LD 340, which would establish different time limits for criminal trials. However, both Nadeau and the Maine Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers oppose the legislation because they say it is not adequate.
Another bill that could get taken up again next session is LD 338, which would expand jury pool diversity. That legislation was passed by both chambers but is being held by the governor. 
Howaniec said the lack of diversity in juries increases the inequity of Maine’s judicial system.
“There’s obviously a disproportionately larger number of minorities charged with crimes because there’s a correlation between poverty and crime,” Howaniec said. 
Carney agreed that the underlying policy is important and said it may be worth looking into how current jury pools are determined.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)It’s not just Republicans in Congress who are being aggressively challenged at town-hall meetings this summer.
Pinellas County state Rep. Berny Jacques heard loudly from some critics about the way Florida Republicans are running the state while hosting a town hall meeting at the Abundant Life Ministries in Largo last Friday night.
While touting DOGE efforts led by Florida Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia to review spending by local governments, Jacques was interrupted by a man who began shouting about “home rule.”
“You’re talking about giving over our finances and giving up control to the state government and having their Big Brother eyes scrutinizing these cities, whether it’s big cities or small cities. Like, what about the city’s own ability to judge for themselves? ” the man yelled at Jacques. “You’re taking away everybody’s power to hold their own electeds responsible if they so choose.”
“I would push back against your dismissiveness of the state’s role in all of this,” Jacques responded. “And I believe in home rule as much as the next guy, but when government is intentionally or blatantly wasting your money, and people don’t have recourse —”
The man angrily retorted: “Wasting your money? $300 million on Alligator Alcatraz!” He referred to the costs of the immigrant detention facility built by the state in the Everglades. (Court filings in a federal lawsuit brought by environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida say that the state has spent at least $218 million in constructing the facility).
“There should be no resistance to being transparent,” Jacques responded, his voice rising. “Anybody who is resistant to be transparent has something to hide, and they need to be brought to heel!” Other members of the crowd cheered him on.
“Like the Hope [Florida] Foundation, right?” Another voice in the audience immediately called out.
Another inquiry about the costs of constructing Alligator Alcatraz prompted Jacques to say that the state and the country gave President Trump the green light to enact his promise of mass deportations of immigrants without legal papers when they reelected him to the White House last year.
“He has to deliver on that mandate,” he said. “Anything less would be a disappointment, and I’m so glad that the president is amping it up, and I’m so glad that our state government is being a strong partner in amping up the deportations because it’s what the people demanded.”
Congressional redistricting
The next issue was congressional redistricting. Gov. Ron DeSantis has said it’s likely the Legislature will follow Texas in redrawing the state’s congressional districts map before the 2026 election.
The woman asking the question prefaced it by denouncing the 2022 congressional map drawn up by Gov. Ron DeSantis that eliminated a majority-Black district in North Florida (that was recently upheld by the Florida Supreme Court).
She also criticized the 2022 state Senate-approved map that a federal judicial panel upheld within the past month. She went on to describe the call by Trump for Republican lawmakers to redraw their congressional lines was a way to “silence the voices of millions of Floridians.”
“Do you intend to support this obvious gerrymandered and partisan redistricting?” she asked Jacques.
“I will support our redistricting if they get the numbers accurately,” he replied, adding that he believes Florida was undercounted in the 2020 U.S. Census and robbed of one or two congressional seats. “So, there should be a new Census,” he said. “There should be a citizenship question. We should know who’s here, and we should redistrict accordingly in a way that’s accurate with the current times.”
A few minutes later a woman stood up and chastised Jacques and the crowd for displaying what she called un-Christian behavior. She then criticized law enforcement officers arresting and detaining people who they claim lack the legal right to be here without due process.
“You have to prove that. Instead of allowing funds to be diverted to federal initiatives, we are investing in concentration camps in the United States,” she said. “Now, the Germans said the Jews were criminals and they were taking away from our —”
An uproar from the crowd ensued, drowning out the remainder of her sentence.
“Before we go to the next person, just to be clear, I disagree with everything she just said,” Jacques responded, as an official with the church intervened to try to keep the peace. At that point, the man who who initially shouted out to Jacques yelled back at the church official. Members of the crowd yelled, “We don’t want to hear you,” and he peaceably left the event.
The crowd settled down after that.
The Pinellas Republican was later asked about SB 180, the measure sponsored by fellow GOP Republican Sen. Nick DiCeglie designed to expedite post-disaster rebuilding. There’s been a substantial backlash from local government officials since it went into effect. They object to a provision that prevents local governments from passing any new local land-use or development regulations that could be considered “more restrictive or burdensome” than what was already on the books.
“We vote on hundreds of bills. And every now and then, probably more times than we care to admit, we have some unintended consequences. And then you have to go back and adjust,” Jacques responded. “That is an issue I’m looking into, because I’ve been hearing from several people who are involved in local government and we don’t want to be overdeveloped.”
Property taxes
Another inquiry from a woman who identified herself as a member of the Pinellas Republican Liberty Caucus was about the (still to be written) constitutional amendment expected to be on the ballot next year aimed at either eliminating or reducing property taxes on homesteads. If approved, she asked, would that mean that the tax burdens would simply just shift into higher sales taxes, more tolls, or higher fees at state parks?
“It will depend on the particular city,” Jacques said. “Even if all homestead property taxes went away, they could still make it up on second homes, they could still make it up on commercial properties.”
He added that the idea that local governments could lose some of their funding via property taxes “forces them to look inward. And then to start making priorities and to get back to basics of police, fire, roads, sewage systems.”
After the meeting, Jacques said he wasn’t taken aback by the aggressive questioning by some members of the audience.
“I’m always prepared to engage with both passionate supporters and those who are not supporters, so I was not surprised,” he told the Phoenix in a text message. “This was our third annual town hall since elected. I welcome the constituent engagement — I work for all of them.”

Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities late last month raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.
Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.
Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.
The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.

“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”
Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.
One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.
“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”
Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.
Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.
After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.
After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.
“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”
In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.
Immigration raid at Washington blaze stokes fear in wildfire crews nationwide

Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.
“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”
After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.
The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.
Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.
A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.
The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.
“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.
Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.
The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.
Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.
One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.
The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.
“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”
Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.
“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.
Trump’s cuts to federal wildfire crews could have ‘scary’ consequences

On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.
“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”
Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.
“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”
Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.
“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”
In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.

This week on the Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith talks with Elyse Cherry, CEO of BlueHub Capital, to discuss the recent court decision that BlueHub violated consumer protection statutes around lending. Where does the case go next, and why did lawmakers push for new rules tailored to BlueHub’s controversial lending practices? 
The post A[...]","EPISODE INFO

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Elyse Cherry, CEO of BlueHub Capital







A MUCH APPLAUDED and maligned mortgage program – Boston-based BlueHub Capital’s SUN program – promises to give second chances to homeowners in dire straits. But homeowners, mortgage, and consumer protection groups paint a darker picture: that the program is actually taking advantage of the people it claims to help.  
About a year after legislators passed and Gov. Maura Healey signed a law tailored to protect the Roxbury nonprofit from consumer protection liability, the organization is processing an unfavorable ruling from a Suffolk County Superior Court judge and bristling against new rules proposed by the attorney general to require more disclosure to homeowners about what they might owe and limit how much revenue the program can bring in. 
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith interviews Elyse Cherry, CEO of BlueHub Capital and Healey donor, about the ruling and the political machinations behind the new law signed by her longtime friend. 
“We think the judge is dead wrong,” Cherry said. “We do not think it’s predatory. As I say, I cannot imagine how a loan could be characterized as predatory when the borrowers owe less money than they owed in the first place.” 
When a homeowner is facing foreclosure. BlueHub, through an affiliated mortgage company, buys out the home and sells it back to the owner for 25 percent more than what BlueHub paid for it. Most of these homeowners also take on an unusual second mortgage known as a shared appreciation mortgage, which obligates the owner to pay a percentage of any future home appreciation to BlueHub if they want to sell or refinance the property. 
A group of homeowners sued in 2020, arguing that they did not understand the mechanics of the agreement when they first signed up. 
A Suffolk Superior Court judge last week found the nonprofit had violated state consumer protection laws on predatory lending practices. Judge Michael Ricciuti determined that BlueHub engaged in illegal “loan splitting” and did not disclose the full terms of the shared appreciation mortgage to homeowners.  
Ricciuti rejected arguments from BlueHub that the organization should be immune from consumer protection suit because it is engaged in a community-minded endeavor. The group’s “core activity is not charitable, but purely commercial,” he wrote. Cherry disputes that, arguing that the four decades of nonprofit work and lack of business competitors suggest this is not a profit-oriented organization.  
As the lawsuit progressed, lawmakers tried repeatedly to offer BlueHub some clear cover for its business practices. An effort in 2022 to make nonprofits offering shared appreciation mortgages – which only covers BlueHub in Massachusetts – retroactively immune from lawsuits as long as they make a limited set of required disclosures fizzled. But another version, that Cherry said specifically is not retroactive, passed in the sweeping 2024 economic development bill.  
Despite pleas to veto the language, Healey signed the bill into law. This sparked cries of personal favoritism, as Cherry has long maxed out donations and held fundraisers for the governor and former attorney general. For her part, Cherry notes a long history of political donations – including to the legislative leaders who had to sign off on the bill in the first place – and says the donations are personal but consistent with the nonprofit’s interest in supporting elected officials aligned with its mission. 
Next steps are still foggy. BlueHub plans to appeal the ruling at a later time. And after a seemingly sweeping win on Beacon Hill, the attorney general’s office is proposing a stricter set of disclosures under new regulations oriented at that business model. 
During the episode, Smith and Cherry discuss the legal ruling (8:15), the law designed to protect BlueHub (15:00), and what regulations the organization says it would accept (24:35).

The idea began when Executive Director Nathan Gotsch, himself a 2022 independent candidate for Congress, dug into election results across the state.
“In 2023 and 2024, 244 independent candidates qualified for partisan races,” Gotsch said in a news release. “More than half of them — 52% — won. Those results point to something real happening in Indiana politics.”
Independents aren’t just running for local offices. More are aiming higher, from countywide seats to the state legislature and even Congress. Nearly a third of independents who lost in 2023-2024 still received 30-49% of the vote.
The initiative highlighted some successful independents. in Huntington, Mayor Richard Strick left the GOP and won twice as an independent; in Bedford, Shawna Girgis served three terms as an independent mayor; and in Lewisville, former Republican state lawmaker Tom Saunders serves on the town council as an independent.
That lines up with an analysis by the Independent Voter Project of Hoosier voters’ partisan leanings.
Based on data from L2, a nonpartisan provider, nearly 44% of registered voters in Indiana are independents — compared to about 31% who are Republicans and 25% who are Democrats. Because Indiana does not register voters by party, these figures are estimated based on recent partisan primary participation and supplemented with modeling analytics, the release said.

Gotsch said “we’re proud to have financial support from multiple Hoosiers – both Republican and Democrat – who’ve seen the negative consequences of not having competitive elections in our state and believe in our mission to change that.”
He also runs Fort Wayne Politics, a free email newsletter about what’s happening behind the scenes in state and local politics.
Independent candidates in Indiana face high barriers, however.
To get on the ballot, candidates must collect petition signatures from registered voters equal to 2% of the most recent secretary of state vote in their district. For a statewide race, that means nearly 37,000 signatures — closer to 50,000 in practice once rejections are factored in. With paid circulators charging at least $15 per valid signature, ballot access for a statewide independent candidate can cost more than $700,000.
“These successful independents prove that voters will cross party lines when given the choice,” Gotsch said. “Independent Indiana exists to shine a spotlight on that success, develop educational resources for prospective candidates, and study what reforms are needed so independents can compete at every level of government.”
The initiative’s launch includes a statewide billboard campaign in Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, Evansville, and northwest Indiana — and two September events:

Tim Walz, on Sept. 2, 2025, said he will call a special session to for lawmakers to vote on gun control measures after two children were killed and another 18 wounded at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis last week. (Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday said he will call a special session for Minnesota lawmakers to vote on a package of gun control measures, although passage seems unlikely in a closely divided Legislature.
Walz, after welcoming Deerwood Elementary School students to their first day of school in Eagan, said Minnesota needs to take action following a mass shooting at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis that killed 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel and 10-year-old Harper Moyski and wounded 18 others last week.
“If Minnesota lets this moment slide and we determine that it’s okay for little ones to not be safe in a school environment or a church environment, then shame on us,” Walz said. “I’m going to call (lawmakers) back.”
The governor said he will release a gun control package this week that will include an assault weapons ban.
Walz said he plans to call a special session even if he gets zero commitments from Republicans to vote for his gun control measures.
Republicans — led by Speaker Lisa Demuth and who are strongly aligned with the gun rights movement —  have 67 members in the House, while Democrats have 66 in their ranks following the June assassination of Democratic-Farmer-Labor caucus leader Melissa Hortman.
Walz and DFL lawmakers are hoping the shooting of a church filled with schoolchildren would pressure Republicans to accede to new laws. A special election to replace Hortman in safely blue District 34B is Sept. 16.
The special session will force Republicans to vote on gun control a little more than a year from a crucial midterm election when all 201 legislative seats will be on the ballot.
“When (Republicans) talk to the parents of these children and they hear the public speaking out, they get to make a decision. Are they going to stand in the way of having an honest debate? Now, we might not get it done in there, but the idea that you would not even come back and make a debate, I think, is untenable,” the governor said.
A majority of Minnesotans supported banning assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines in a MinnPost poll from 2022.
Democrats had full control of the Legislature in 2023 and 2024, but they failed to pass a statewide ban on assault weapons. They did pass a slate of other gun control measures, however. They instituted an extreme risk protection order, or “red flag,” law that allows family members or police to ask judges to take guns from people deemed a danger to themselves or others and passed universal background check requirements.
Although a special legislative session would force Republicans to take potentially difficult votes on gun regulation, it would also give them an opportunity to propose legislation of their own. Although only the governor can call the Legislature into special session, only lawmakers have the power to adjourn.
Republicans are already signaling they will make a special session about culture war issues given the Annunciation Church shooter’s apparent trans identity.
Rep. Drew Roach, R-Farmington, said in a press release that he will propose a bill repealing a ban on conversion therapy if lawmakers are called into a special session. The law, passed in 2023, prohibits mental health professionals from providing therapy that seeks to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity.
Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, dismissed the idea of a special election in a statement last week.
“Republicans are committed to addressing the root causes of violence, supporting safe schools and increasing access to mental health resources. Calling for a special session without even consulting legislative leaders is not a serious way to begin. This is a partisan stunt from a governor who continues to engage in destructive political rhetoric,” Johnson said.
Walz cautioned Republicans to keep a special session focused on gun control.
“If we call a special session, and (Republicans) decide to deflect this to something else, my guess is that that Minnesotans are not going to be too happy about that,” Walz said.
The governor on Tuesday said he’s open to proposing more resources for mental health in his gun control package, but guns are the culprit in mass shootings.
“I am not going to allow anyone to try and make the case that the United States is unique in either mental health issues or other things,” Walz said. “The thing that makes America unique in terms of shootings is we just have more guns and the wrong types of guns that are on the streets.”
Walz didn’t provide a timeline for when he plans to call lawmakers back to session, but he will likely wait at least until the House returns to a tie after the Sept. 16 special election.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/walzatdeerwood-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-02 10:57:57.288019

(LRC Public Information)The chair of the Senate Transportation Committee will not seek reelection after his term ends next year. 
Sen. Jimmy Higdon, a Lebanon Republican, will retire from the Kentucky General Assembly in December 2026. He was elected to the Senate in 2009. Before that, he was in the House beginning in 2003. 
“It has been the honor of my life to serve the people of the 14th District,” Higdon said in a Tuesday morning press release. “The greatest privilege of this job is getting to help people every single day. I’ve always tried to treat it as a calling, not just a position, and I am deeply thankful for the opportunity.”
Higdon’s Senate district includes the counties of LaRue, Marion, Nelson, Spencer and Washington. 
The senator said that he is “at the peak of my legislative career” and that “I have seen too many colleagues stay too long.” Spending more time with family was a key factor in his decision to not seek reelection. 
“I am 72 now. If I ran again, I’d be almost 78 at the end of another term,” Higdon said. “It’s the right time. My wife Jane, who has been by my side in marriage for 51 years, and my family deserve more of me. We’ve made a lot of sacrifices together to make this work, and I could not have done any of it without them.”
In addition to chairing the Senate Transportation Committee, Higdon is a member of the committees on Education; Licensing and Occupations; Veterans, Military Affairs and Public Protection. He was Senate majority whip from 2015 to 2018 and Senate president pro tempore from January 2018 to 2019. 
The 2026 legislative session will be Higdon’s final session in office. Republicans will continue to hold a supermajority in the Senate. Currently, the GOP has 32 of 38 seats in the chamber. 
Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, said in the press release that Higdon “will leave a lasting legislative legacy deeply woven into the fabric of this commonwealth.” 
“What stands out most about Jimmy is the way he has always put people first. He approaches every challenge with humility and common sense,” Stivers continued. “His voice will be deeply missed in our chamber by our caucus members and by our staff, who have enjoyed working with him. We are grateful to have one more session with him and to celebrate a career of service that he and Jane can be incredibly proud of.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/higdon101524-1024x691.jpeg,,,2025-09-02 10:57:57.288019

Mike Kehoe discusses the 2025 legislative session with reporters in his Capitol office on May 16 (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).The son of a Republican lawmaker is suing Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe alleging his First Amendment rights were violated when Kehoe preemptively declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard in anticipation of what turned out to be peaceful protests against the Trump administration across the state and nation in June. 
Lucas Cierpiot, a disability-rights activist from Blue Springs, said he felt intimidated by the governor’s actions and too unsafe to attend any “No Kings” protests  on June 14. His lawsuit alleges the order violated Cierpiot’s right to free speech, free assembly and association. 
It also was an act of discrimination based on disability, Cierpiot contends, since those with vision impairments would be uniquely vulnerable “to projectile weapons fired by crowd control troops.” Ciepriot is legally blind in one eye.
“It was an abuse of process to declare a false emergency when a true emergency did not exist,” Cierpoit writes in his lawsuit. “When Kehoe issued the order, there were no protests occurring anywhere in Missouri at all, and certainly not any that were un-peaceful.” 
A spokeswoman for Kehoe declined comment on the pending lawsuit, instead pointing to the governor’s June 12 statement when he declared the state of emergency. 
“We respect, and will defend, the right to peacefully protest,” Kehoe said at the time, “but we will not tolerate violence or lawlessness in our state.”
Two days before scheduled protests in June, Kehoe signed Executive Order 25-25, activating the Missouri National Guard as a “precautionary measure” to protect against “events that are occurring or could occur.”
The move was denounced by the ACLU of Missouri as an “unnecessary provocation to thwart public dissent” and by House Minority Leader Ashley Aune as “a blatant attempt to intimidate and suppress First Amendment rights.”
A day after issuing the order, Kehoe announced that he would be leaving the country during the state of emergency for a long-planned trade mission to Europe. 
Anti-Trump ‘No Kings’ rallies draw thousands to peaceful protests across Missouri

Thousands gathered that Saturday at protests in cities and towns across the state, as well as around the steps of the Missouri Capitol in Jefferson City. The weekend protests were peaceful and came and went without incident. 
Protesters demonstrated throughout the U.S. that day as President Donald Trump hosted a military parade in Washington on his birthday. The coordinated events followed Trump’s deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles against the wishes of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Demonstrators spoke against Trump’s immigration crackdowns and dismissals of federal workers. 
Cierpiot was not among the protesters. 
He writes that he originally planned to attend, given his history of advocating for “civil, constitutional and anti-discrimination rights of persons with blindness, low-vision and/or diseases of the eye.”
But Cierpiot said the governor’s order and the activation of the National Guard prevented him from participating in the protests. 
“Kehoe issuing this escalatory false emergency declaration represented a very real threat to plaintiff’s safety,” the lawsuit says, adding that Cierpiot was not afraid of anything related to the protests themselves and only felt unsafe due to the “possibility of police or military response.” 
Rubber bullets, pepper spray and tear gas, Cierpiot says in the suit, “are a significant threat to a patriot with low-vision and/or diseases of the eye,” threatening the “permanent loss of what remaining vision plaintiff does have as a price of exercising free speech.” 
Cierpiot — whose father is state Sen. Mike Cierpiot, a Lee’s Summit Republican — is currently representing himself in the lawsuit, which was filed in Jackson County. He said in an email to The Independent that he is in the process of interviewing attorneys. 
Last year, Cierpiot garnered headlines after filing a formal complaint accusing Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey of violating the rules of professional conduct for lawyers. The complaint focused on campaign contributions and accused Bailey of using his office “for his personal political benefit.”
The Office of the Chief Disciplinary Counsel declined to investigate the complaint, leading Cierpiot to request the Missouri Supreme Court intervene. The court declined to get involved and the ethics complaint was dismissed.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1968-e1747406679213-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-02 10:57:57.288019

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)More than 300 people turned out in an empty Columbus Arena District Monday to protest what they see as the depredations of the Trump administration.
It was Labor Day, and organizers and protesters both played up the fact that the administration’s biggest achievement so far is to take more than $1 trillion out of Medicaid and food assistance, while giving a $1 trillion tax break to the richest 1% of Americans. 
“They blame immigrants so you won’t blame billionaires,” one sign said in a reference to President Trump’s mass deportations.
“Save democracy, abolish oligarchy,” said another. 
But rally goers expressed other concerns — including that by trying to stigmatize efforts at diversity, Trump is weakening the country.
“I’m all about diversity. That’s why America is amazing to begin with,” said Karen Hill. “I don’t want people to live with cruelty. Every day it’s overwhelming. That’s why I’m here.”
A 1977 high school graduate, Hill said things seem worse now than they did then.
She said getting out and protesting makes her feel better when she becomes discouraged. 
“We’ve been to several,” she said. “I’m not saying we’re saving the world but I want to be here. I can’t take the chaos and everything. I’m always asking myself, what happened today. I’m tired of that. Somebody running our rights over. It’s not right. I don’t want to have a dictator.”

Addison Torrence, 26, said he turned out “to protect worker’s rights. To protect trans kids rights. All of our freedoms. Speak out against the corruption of the billionaire class.”
The crowd Monday appeared to be somewhat younger than the ones that came out to protest in Columbus during the first months of the Trump administration. 
“I’m hearing a lot of frustration and fear from people,” Torrence said of his friends.
Does that mean they’re tuning in?
“I’d like to think so,” Torrence said. “We’re out here showing something to the people we’re here to speak out for.”
Monday’s rally was organized by several groups, including the protest group 50501. It was one of dozens in Ohio and more than 1,000 across the country.
“At a time when the billionaire agenda is turning the federal government into a slush fund for the wealthy, gutting Medicaid, firing federal workers and ravaging families through ICE raids, working families are coming together to demand ‘workers over billionaires,'” 50501 said in a written statement.
Labor day rallies on workers’ behalf have a long history in the United States. In her Substack newsletter, historian Heather Cox Richardson on Sunday explained the history of the holiday. 
On Sept. 5, 1882, more than 10,000 paraded through lower Manhattan to highlight workers’ crucial role in an industrializing economy.
The marchers “carried banners saying: ‘Labor Built This Republic and Labor Shall Rule It,’ ‘Labor Creates All Wealth,’ ‘No Land Monopoly,’ ‘No Money Monopoly,’ ‘Labor Pays All Taxes,’ ‘The Laborer Must Receive and Enjoy the Full Fruit of His Labor,’ ‘Eight Hours for a Legal Day’s Work,’ and ‘The True Remedy Is Organization and the Ballot,'” Richardson’s essay said.

Perhaps foreshadowing the present day, the movement ignited a debate over income inequality and whether the people who decided how much everybody would get paid were really worth so much more than the people on the factory floor.
That debate raged as workers in 1884 helped to elect Grover Cleveland president. Then in 1888, Benjamin Harrison, the pro-Wall Street candidate, lost the popular vote, but won in the Electoral College. Four years later, there was a backlash, with Cleveland being re-elected in a landslide, Richardson wrote.",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250901_163617-1024x644.jpg,,,2025-09-02 09:57:07.363879

In the past month or so, federal courts have dealt a string of blows to conservatives’ push for the biblical Ten Commandments to be posted in public schools.
Yet as states lose over required religious displays, many are working on another route to faith-based education by allowing kids to attend off-campus religious instruction. This year, Iowa, Montana, Ohio and Texas passed laws guaranteeing parents the right to have their children excused during the school day for free, off-campus religious instruction, often called “released time.”
Those four states are the latest of at least 12 that require school districts to offer released time religious schooling upon parental request, including: Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wisconsin.
The released time approach may be more likely to pass constitutional muster than other government-imposed religious efforts, experts say, by shifting influence off school grounds and under the direction of faith-based groups rather than public school teachers, and by making it free to students.
A 1952 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Zorach v. Clauson allows for released time religious instruction as long as it’s off school property, privately funded and parent permitted.
Eyeing a friendly Supreme Court, Republicans push for the Ten Commandments in schools

“Not every family has access to private or parochial school, but for many generations families have been able to take their students out of school for a portion of the day for religious education if they choose,” said Jennifer Jury, a program advocate for LifeWise Academy, an Ohio-based Christian nonprofit founded in 2018.
The organization has been active in expanding its reach and lobbying lawmakers for stronger legislative support. This school year, LifeWise expects to serve nearly 100,000 public school students across 1,100 schools in 34 states, Jury said.
The off-campus gatherings work the same way in most states: With parents’ approval, public school students sign out of school during a lunch, recess or study hall block. Students will either walk or ride one of the distinctive red LifeWise buses to a local church or a program-leased community building in town.
And depending on state limitations for the religious instruction, for either a half or full hour, kids will learn about the Bible. When the allotted time is up, students go back to their public school to finish the day.
In some states, students can earn academic credit for the off-campus instruction, which has been more controversial.
In Montana, for example, legislation that would have required school districts to develop policies for academic credit was amended to “authorize” a district to allow credit, after pushback from the state’s school boards and school administrators associations.
“School districts should have the autonomy to determine which external coursework aligns with the academic frameworks and whether such courses should be eligible for credit,” Rob Watson, who represented the two groups at the legislature, said in his comments to a House committee in February. He noted the groups did not oppose the released time policy itself.
Despite the changes, only one Democrat in the legislature voted “yes.” Montana GOP Gov. Greg Gianforte signed the bill into law in May.
Supporters had touted the academic credit option as a way to entice homeschooling families to consider public schools. In her interview with Stateline, Jury noted similar programs that accommodate Jewish, Muslim and Mormon faith-based teaching for public school students.
“Whether a person is religious or not, the Bible is widely recognized as one of the most influential books in history,” Jury said. “A lot of our Western culture was born out of ideas that come from the Bible, like the fact that every person is created equal, that we are to love our neighbor.”
 Identical bill language

The conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, known as ALEC, in August adopted model legislation about released time policies that state lawmakers can propose.
Public schools would be required to allow dismissal for religious instruction under new bill

ALEC’s proposal would allow from one to five hours per week of off-campus religious instruction and would require school districts to award academic credit if the course meets certain criteria. Districts would have to assess instruction based on secular standards and would not be allowed to test for particular religious content, according to the model legislation.
Nearly identical language had already appeared in several state bills, including in North Carolina and West Virginia this year and in Mississippi in 2023. In North Carolina, LifeWise Academy registered with the secretary of state’s office in 2024, as reported by NC Newsline, and a released time bill was introduced in February. It was sent to committee but never moved ahead.
The bills in Mississippi and West Virginia also stalled.
Legislation that does become law earns praise from groups such as Alliance Defending Freedom, one of the nation’s most active legal organizations opposing abortion rights and same-sex marriage.
Statements from Greg Chafuen, senior counsel for the nonprofit’s Center for Public Policy, say the new released time laws respect “parents’ educational decisions” and ensure “parents are in the driver’s seat when it comes to their kids’ education.”
An Indiana law lets high school students leave school for religious instruction each week for an amount of time equal to one elective course. Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee laws allow students to earn elective credit for released time religious instruction, though it cannot replace a “core curriculum” class. School boards can set standards for when such programs qualify for credit.
LifeWise operates in each of those states.
 Ten Commandment displays

Jury, of LifeWise Academy, said her organization wants off-campus religious options for public school students to be available in all 50 states.
“It’s important to note this is an option, and parents are the ultimate decision-makers in enrollment,” she said.
“We would love to see every student in the United States have the option to attend a program like LifeWise if they want to and if their parents want them to.”
A lack of parental choice might be what trips up state efforts to post the Ten Commandments in classrooms.










This is an option, and parents are the ultimate decision-makers in enrollment. 


– Jennifer Jury, a program advocate for LifeWise Academy


After Louisiana last year became the first state in recent decades to require that the Ten Commandments, a central tenet of the Judeo-Christian tradition, be displayed in school classrooms, bills followed in at least 15 other states. Two states — Arkansas and Texas — enacted laws.
But for now, courts have blocked the mandates in all three states. In Texas, U.S. District Judge Fred Biery warned the displays “are likely to pressure [children] into religious observance” and undermine parents’ rights.
In Arkansas, U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks called the state’s requirement to post a specific version of the Ten Commandments “plainly unconstitutional.”
The law “is not neutral with respect to religion,” he wrote. “By design, and on its face, the statute mandates the display of expressly religious scripture in every public-school classroom and library.”
He also noted that the law “requires that a specific version of that scripture be used, one that the uncontroverted evidence in this case shows is associated with Protestantism and is exclusionary of other faiths.”

The poll conducted for No Kid Hungry found that 96% of those surveyed said child hunger should not exist in the state. More than eight in 10 want elected officials to do more to end child hunger. Ninety-three percent said ending childhood hunger in Maryland should be a shared, bipartisan goal for lawmakers.
“This poll paints a stark picture of how Maryland families are suffering. No one should have to choose between purchasing food and paying your rent, but that’s an all-too-familiar choice our neighbors find themselves having to make,” Ayesha Holmes, No Kid Hungry Maryland director said in a statement. “With impending cuts to SNAP and Medicaid on the way, Maryland families will continue to face a future impacted by hunger and undue worry.”
The poll found that 65% of those surveyed said they had to choose between buying food or paying for gas or a car repair, rent or mortgage, or medical treatment. Within that survey, 71% of families said they had to make that choice, according to the poll. Nearly six in ten people said their mental health has suffered in the last 12 months due to the cost of food, according to the poll.

More than six in 10 said they worry about their ability to buy groceries if they were to be hit with an unexpected expense of $500.
The online survey conducted for No Kid Hungry sampled 1,054 Maryland residents between July 22-29. The margin of error is 4%.
The poll followed passage of federal legislation that makes permanent tax cuts made in 2017. The cuts are offset, in part, by cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Advocates say passage of the bill could deal “a devastating blow” to the 680,000 state residents who currently receive SNAP benefits.
Currently, the state and federal government split administrative costs for SNAP 50/50, while the federal government pays for 100% of the benefit.
That changes next year. States will pay 75% of the administrative fees. The cost to Maryland will approach an estimated $173 million. In 2027, Maryland will pick up 15% of the cost of the benefit on top of administrative costs -— about $240 million.
Nearly 370,000 Maryland resident could lose part or all of their benefits, according to a recent report by the Urban Institute.
The poll found that nearly six in 10 people had a favorable view of the SNAP program. More than 80% said Maryland should continue a summer program to ensure children have access to food when schools are closed.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SNAP-logo-USDA-1.jpg,,,2025-09-02 09:57:07.363879

However, as regular readers know, I love the game of baseball. And, on occasion, baseball references will make their way into my writing. This is one such occasion.
If you’ve come here for Iowa politics, however, please don’t turn away. I believe there is a political component to this story. And, later in this column, I will tell you about how, on a different topic, top Iowa Republicans are turning on one of their own. But first, baseball.
A few days ago, The Athletic reported Major League Baseball is coming back to Iowa next season.
After a four-year absence, there will be a Major League game at the Field of Dreams in Dyersville, the site of the 1989 movie of the same name. The game will be between the Minnesota Twins and Philadelphia Phillies.
This will be an occasion for MLB to bask in the romanticism that stems from the movie starring Kevin Costner and James Earl Jones. Iowa’s tourism industry will benefit from the attention, too.
However, I think of this as more an occasion to point out how much MLB disrespects its fans living in Iowa, even as it seeks to leverage the nostalgia of the Field of Dreams. And I hope to the extent the state’s politicians celebrate this game next year, they’ll also remember the fans who are being mistreated.
Mostly, I’m talking about MLB.TV’s blackout rules. (I almost used the words “draconian blackout rules,” but as any baseball fan living in Iowa knows, it is unnecessary to apply the adjective.) In my area, six teams are not available to me, including those hundreds of miles away. It’s not at all unusual that, on any given day, 25-30% of the games on MLB.TV are blacked out. This even though no Major League team resides in Iowa.
I’m a Baltimore Orioles fan, so the remarkable run by the Milwaukee Brewers this year isn’t nearly as interesting to me as the implosion of my team, which pre-season prognosticators said would compete for the playoffs. Had I been interested, however, in watching the Brewers, I would be out of luck. Brewers’ games are blacked out, even though I have practically zero chance of seeing them otherwise. Even though I paid $150 for a yearlong subscription.
I realize that a lot of baseball fans across the country complain about blackout rules.
I also realize my complaints about MLB aren’t as articulate as those of other writers. For this, I recommend you read Joe Queenan’s recent column in the Wall Street Journal, where he contemplates the dispute between the Major League team owners and players over a possible salary cap — and suggests that neither side deserves our sympathy.
He concludes by saying, “whoever ultimately wins this battle, the fans are going to get screwed. As usual.”
Which is kind of the way I feel about the Field of Dreams game. MLB will benefit from the nostalgia for the game next year, and Iowa tourism will get a bump. Which is a good thing. Our economy definitely needs whatever boost it can get given the way things have been going.
However, if nothing changes, Iowa baseball fans who want to watch Major League teams will be left paying a hefty sum for the privilege of draconian (there, I said it) blackout rules that will leave them fuming.

State officials have barred the import, transport and sale of two fast-growing invasive species that were once popular garden ornamentals but have now wreaked havoc on natural vegetation.
The Alaska Division of Agriculture on Friday said it issued a quarantine for the two species: Prunus padus, commonly known as the European bird cherry tree or mayday tree, and Prunus virginiana, commonly known as the Canada red or chokecherry tree.

	The order went into effect Monday.
In essence, it will extend through the state a ban that was imposed in 2017 in Anchorage. The trees have become a particular nuisance in Alaska’s largest city, where they have proliferated in greenbelts and other spaces and crowded out native species like birch and spruce.
State and local officials have been trying to remove these non-native trees, and the new policy should help that effort, said Division of Agriculture Director Bryan Scoresby.
“This quarantine prohibits the importation, transport, and sale within the state of these two trees and their parts,” Scoresby said in a statement. “Many agencies continue to pursue control measures with the goal of eliminating these invasive trees. With this quarantine, the flow of trees into Alaska will stop, making this goal more attainable.”

The ornamentals quickly spread, displacing native vegetation, impeding animals’ access and upsetting natural food webs, according to the University of Alaska Fairbanks Cooperative Extension Service.
Their berries can be toxic to moose, causing cyanide poisoning that is sometimes fatal.
Along with those problems, the invasives might be spreading disease to other trees, according to the Division of Agriculture. A fungal disease called “Black Knot” was recently discovered on chokecherry trees on the University of Alaska Anchorage campus, making the invasive trees potential disease spreaders, the division said.
The two tree species are prime targets of annual Anchorage “weed smackdown” invasive-removal events. There is also a concerted effort to remove the trees from Fairbanks, including on the UAF campus, where officials have been methodically replacing them with native trees.
Eradicating the trees might require more than simply cutting them down because new trees can grow out of root systems below stumps, according to the Cooperative Extension Service.
For all the damage the two invasive tree species cause in Alaska, however, some people have found ways to benefit from them. The toxin in their berries can be neutralized and eaten by people.

Largely out of public view and with little to no debate, lawmakers on Friday sped through hundreds of bills that had new spending attached, rejecting or stalling more than a quarter of the 686 proposals that were held in the appropriations committees’ suspense files, report CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu and Jeanne Kuang. Some notable ones that are dead for the year are:

Senate Bill 445 to streamline California’s high-speed rail project, which aimed to speed up permitting and ease restrictions that bill supporters say significantly slow construction. Backed by the California High-Speed Rail Authority and Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, the bill faced strong opposition from local governments and underwent multiple amendments before it was ultimately spiked.


Assembly Bill 938 to allow people to clear their records of violent crimes that they committed as victims of trafficking or domestic violence.


SB 712 to exempt owners of classic cars from the state’s smog-check requirements. As CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow explains, former late-night talk show host Jay Leno was one of the supporters of the bill, arguing that modern emissions standards discourage people from owning classic cars in California. Clean air and environmental groups opposed the measure, and state regulators warned that, if passed, the bill could cost California millions to enact. Read more here.

The Legislature still needs to give its final approval for the bills that advanced by Sept. 12 to reach Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk, where the measures can win his signature or die with his veto. These include:

SB 707 to allow local officials to continue attending public meetings remotely and require bigger cities to offer remote access to the public. The proposal builds on a policy that offered flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic, but good government groups say it is one that made it more difficult for the public to confront elected officials.


SB 437 to give California State University up to $6 million to research the methodology to confirm an individual’s status as a descendant of an enslaved person; and SB 518 to create a new bureau within the state Department of Justice to oversee reparations.

Gig workers step closer to unionizing rights


Demonstrators gather in support of new legislation allowing ride-hail drivers to unionize at the state Capitol in Sacramento on April 8, 2025. Photo by Louis Bryant III for CalMatters




CalMatters economy reporter Levi Sumagaysay:
California Uber and Lyft drivers are poised to gain the right to unionize under a deal touted as “historic” by the governor and the leaders of the state Assembly and Senate on Friday. 
AB 1340, sponsored by the Service Employees International Union, would give the drivers the right to unionize. It had been opposed by a group representing the gig companies, and an Uber spokesperson previously told CalMatters that it would mean increased costs for the company.
Now the bill is being tied to industry-sponsored legislation, SB 371, which would lower insurance-coverage requirements. Because Uber had been pushing for this change, it has withdrawn its opposition to the unionization bill, saying both bills represent a compromise. 
Gig companies like Uber and Lyft consider their drivers independent contractors. If drivers unionize, the companies would be required to bargain with them. 
A Lyft statement cheered the insurance bill but did not explicitly indicate support for the unionization bill, and a Lyft spokesperson said the company would have no comment about it.
Both bills advanced last week and the blessing by the state’s top politicians means their passage is all but assured.



Reexamining gang-related crimes?

Two decisions issued by the California Supreme Court last week could have major implications for sentencing gang-related offenses, and enable thousands of people to request their cases be reexamined by the courts, write CalMatters’ Joe Garcia and Nigel Duara.
One of the decisions overturned a defendant’s death sentence and kicked back the case to a trial court. The other sided with two incarcerated people who argued that prior gang-related charges that counted toward a three-strikes sentence on their records should not be considered as strikes.
Both rulings involved a 2021 California law that raised the bar of evidence for proving that someone broke a law as part of “criminal street-gang activity.”
In different ways, the state’s high court applied the new standard to past convictions. But it remains unclear how far-reaching these rulings will be, and whether it would open the door for others looking to reverse life sentences under the “three strikes” law.

Ethan Corson is running for governor in 2026 in what promises to be a robust primary campaign among Democrats and Republicans.,"Kansas state Sen. Ethan Corson, a Fairway Democrat seeking the party's nomination for governor in 2026, said on the Kansas Reflector podcast the state benefits from centrist, moderate leadership in the governor's office. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Ethan Corson said he had no interest in campaigning for Kansas governor by engaging in sleight-of-hand politics or the partisan food fights of strident liberals or conservatives.
“When folks look at what they need in the next governor, it’s not somebody who’s going to move this state to the right or move this state to the left. It’s somebody who is going to move this state forward,” Corson said. “I think Kansas has done better when we had common sense, common ground moderate leadership who can work with members of both parties to really solve problems.”
Corson, who resides in Fairway and represents a Kansas Senate district in Johnson County, said on the Kansas Reflector podcast that he would concentrate as governor on lowering real-world costs borne by families. He would seek suitable financing of quality public schools. He would emphasize expansion of business opportunity and job creation throughout the state’s 105 counties.


The office of governor is a wide open race for Republicans and Democrats in the August primary and November general elections of 2026. Term-limited Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly will step aside in January 2027.
The Democratic field features Corson and state Sen. Cindy Holscher, who also serves a district in Johnson County. The Republican campaign is numerically more robust. The GOP roster includes former Gov. Jeff Colyer, Secretary of State Scott Schwab, Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt and Senate President Ty Masterson. All six contenders were at one time in the Legislature.
Corson, 43, grew up dreaming of playing baseball at the University of Kansas or Kansas State University. That didn’t work out. Instead, he was a left-handed pitcher at Garden City Community College and Washington University in St. Louis. He earned degrees at both schools before completing a law degree at WU.
“In the Garden City experience, I really learned so much,” he said. “I was on a team with folks from all around the state, from all different backgrounds who brought all different kinds of life experiences. It really opened my eyes to the beauty of the state, to the diversity of the people around the state and to kind of our common values in Kansas.”
 
Quality of life issues
Corson worked as an attorney in private practice in the District of Columbia for seven years. He was a senior adviser to the U.S. Department of Commerce secretary under President Barack Obama. At the Department of Commerce, he was chief of staff of the International Trade Association.
He returned to Kansas to become executive director of the Kansas Democratic Party. In 2020, he was elected to the Kansas Senate and won reelection in 2024. He’s married to Jenna Brofsky, a labor lawyer who served on the Fairway City Council. They have two sons.
In the Legislature, Corson said he was proud to have been part of a coalition that eliminated the state’s 6.5% sales tax on groceries as well as the state’s income tax on Social Security benefits. He said not enough attention had been paid by the Republican-led Legislature to other options for moderating basic costs faced by families.
“Kansas has been a place where you could send your kid to a good public school and where you could have an affordable middle class quality of life,” Corson said. “I worry that we’ve moved away from that.”
He said he would move Kansas forward through construction of more middle-income housing. He would seek a bipartisan child tax credit to help parents with young kids. He said the state ought to expand a property tax freeze for elderly residents, because too few qualify for the existing program.
He said the state’s $7.25 per hour minimum wage was inadequate. Oklahoma likewise ties its minimum wage to the federal standard of $7.25, but the minimum stood at $13.50 in Nebraska, $13.75 in Missouri and $14.81 in Colorado.
“If you’re working full-time in Kansas, you should not be living in poverty,” Corson said.
He said Kansas had to push for excellence in education and economic development so young Kansans didn’t feel they had to leave the state to do what they wanted professionally.
“When I’m governor, if the Legislature sends me a bill that I don’t think adequately and fully funds our schools, I’m going to veto that bill. If the Legislature sends me a bill that’s going to take public money and put it into private schools, I’m going to veto that bill,” he said.
 
Health care, constitution
Corson has endorsed legislation to expand Medicaid eligibility for lower-income Kansans. That effort has been stalled by Republicans for more than a decade despite apprehension that rejecting billions of dollars in federal aid financially weakened hospitals and clinics. Pending federal cuts to Medicaid could elevate the threat, Corson said.
“We could have facilities closing over the next couple of years,” he said. “One of the things to remember is that when a hospital in the community closes it’s not just the people on Medicaid who lose access. It’s everybody.”
He said he opposed a proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution that would have nullified a Kansas Supreme Court decision affirming women had a fundamental right to end a pregnancy. The amendment failed 59% to 41%.
“These are not decisions where we need politicians in Topeka dictating what kind of health care women can and can’t receive,” he said.
Corson said he opposed a constitutional amendment to be placed on the August 2026 ballot that would replace the state’s merit-selection process for appointing Supreme Court justices with a system of statewide election of the justices.
He said the resulting election campaigns would be financed by organizations or individuals with ideological agendas rather than a commitment to the review of case facts in terms of the constitution and court precedent.
“I don’t think Kansans want to basically put the Supreme Court up for sale to the highest bidder,” Corson said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P8250214b-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-02 08:56:35.286335

Recently appointed Florida Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia announced Tuesday that he is running for a four-year term for the position in 2026.
“My name is Blaise Ingoglia. I speak four languages: English, profanity, sarcasm, and real s—,” the native New Yorker says in a campaign video released Tuesday morning. “I’m running for Chief Financial Officer because I am done watching taxpayers get screwed by governments gone wild.”
That anti-tax attitude has fueled Ingoglia’s biggest public initiative since being appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis to replace Jimmy Patronis in July — leading a team of Florida DOGE auditors to scrutinize spending by city and county governments throughout the state.
Ingoglia has been a major player in Florida politics for over a decade. He was first elected to the Florida House in 2014, and the next year was elected to chair the Republican Party of Florida (he served in that position until 2019). He had served in the Florida Senate representing Hernando County since 2020 until DeSantis appointed him to the Cabinet position earlier this summer.
The chief financial officer of Florida is one of three Cabinet-level positions in state government, along with the attorney general and agriculture commissioner, and goes up for election every four years. Together, they help the governor administer a number of state agencies.
The CFO is the statutory head of the Department of Financial Services, which oversees more than a dozen state agencies, including the State Fire Marshal, Consumer Services, and Inspector General. The position pays $140,000 a year.
Ingoglia is the only major candidate to declare for the Florida CFO position so far. Until recently, he was the underdog in the race, with fellow Republican Joe Gruters — already endorsed by Donald Trump — crushing him in one political poll.
However, that challenge was averted after Trump picked Gruters to head the Republican National Committee, which happened late last month.

Gavin Newsom stepped up to a lectern on a March day three years ago and proposed a new solution to one of the state’s most difficult problems: How to help the thousands of Californians sleeping on the streets while suffering from severe mental illness. 
After all, he said, everything the state has done before has failed. One of the state’s prior attempts — a treatment referral program called Laura’s Law – helped just 218 people during the 2018-19 fiscal year, he said.
“That certainly is not demonstrable progress,” Newsom said. His new program would be different. 
But in the nearly two years since Newsom launched CARE Court, it has reached only a few hundred people. That’s barely more than the law he criticized, and certainly not the thousands he promised.
CalMatters requested CARE Court data from every county in California and conducted more than 30 interviews to compile the first detailed, statewide look at the program. Up and down California, the data show low numbers, a slow rollout and predictions that wildly outpaced reality.
The program was designed to allow family members, first responders, doctors and others to petition the courts on behalf of someone with severe psychosis who can’t take care of themselves. If the petition is accepted, that person can then agree to voluntary treatment, which can include counseling, medication, housing and more.
If they refuse, a judge can order them to participate in a treatment plan.
CalMatters received responses from all but four of the state’s 58 counties. Here’s what the data shows:  

While Newsom’s administration estimated between 7,000 and 12,000 Californians would qualify for CARE Court, just 2,421 petitions have been filed through July, according to the Judicial Council of California. Only 528 of those have resulted in treatment agreements or plans.
San Diego County anticipated receiving 1,000 petitions in the first year and establishing court-ordered treatment plans for 250 people. But in nearly two years, the county instead has received just 384 petitions and established 134 voluntary agreements.
Los Angeles County saw 511 petitions filed – the most in the state. Of those, 112 resulted in care agreements or plans. In 2023, officials predicted to news organizations the county could enroll 4,500 people in the first year.
Courts across California are dismissing a significant percentage of CARE Court petitions – about 45% statewide, although that number includes the handful of cases in which someone has successfully “graduated” from the program. The rate is even higher in some counties, such as San Francisco, where nearly two-thirds of petitions are thrown out. 
The allure of CARE Court for many supporters was the promise of court-ordered treatment plans that would encourage sick people to accept the help they’d been resisting. But the courts have ordered just 14 treatment plans so far, according to the Judicial Council. Instead, most counties are solely offering voluntary treatment “agreements,” which sick people are free to ignore.
Very few people have successfully completed CARE Court. Despite the fact that it has the most petitions, Los Angeles County has had no graduations. Nine counties have been operating CARE Court long enough to have graduations (the program takes at least a year to complete). 

“It’s going much more slowly than we thought it would,” said Lisa U’Ren, a former member of the  board of directors at the Solano County branch of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, who helped roll out the program in her county. 
The stakes are high for Newsom, who has tied his legacy in part to big promises that he would address California’s twin problems of homelessness and inadequate mental health services. The establishment of CARE Court was followed by a 2023 law intended to make it easier for a judge to order someone into involuntary treatment. A successful 2024 ballot measure issued $6.4 billion in debt to pay for new mental health housing. 

How CARE Court works
Once someone files a CARE Court petition on behalf of a person experiencing psychosis, the county investigates that person’s diagnosis and then the court determines if they are eligible for the program. If they are, they have regular meetings with a case worker, as well as regular court hearings, with the goal of agreeing to a treatment protocol called a “CARE agreement.”
If a voluntary agreement can’t be reached, the court can order the person to follow a CARE plan. After one year, the client can either complete the program and graduate, or extend for up to one more year.

State officials say CARE Court needs more time to hit the goals initially set by the Newsom administration. Already some counties are doing an “incredible job,” said Stephanie Welch, deputy secretary of behavioral health for the state Health and Human Services Agency. She pointed to Alameda County, which has racked up 125 petitions — among the most in the state – since December. 
“I think this has been a complicated program to implement,” Welch said, “and that’s something that we recognize and we’ve been doing our best to support the counties to be able to expand this program.”
A spokesperson for Newsom’s office said the administration is pleased with what the program has accomplished so far.
“Thanks to the CARE Act, thousands of people are engaging in critical behavioral health treatment through stabilizing medications, community-based care, and — if needed — housing,” Elana Ross said in an emailed statement.

But disability rights organizations say the low numbers are evidence that the program was a waste of money, a reactionary political gambit by a governor with presidential aspirations. And many families who initially threw their support behind CARE Court also say it has come up short. 
Anita Fisher advocated for the program when Newsom proposed it, speaking on 60 Minutes about her family’s story and meeting with the governor himself, she said. When the program was piloted in San Diego County, where she lives, she felt hopeful about its promise to treat people with serious mental illness, like her son.
“I’ve watched my son suffer too many times: jail, prison, homeless,” she said. “And I said, ‘so if this can stop that?’ I said, ‘Yes, I’m all for it.’”
But now?
“I look at it as a total failure.” 
A petition could be rejected because the person doesn’t meet the narrow eligibility criteria (only people with schizophrenia and other limited psychotic disorders qualify). When the subject of a petition is homeless, outreach workers sometimes have trouble finding them on the street. Other times, the client simply refuses services – and, CARE Court has little teeth to force them to accept, even after a judge’s order.
Making more people eligible for CARE Court
A bill making its way through the Legislature could boost CARE Court numbers by making more people eligible. If Sen. Thomas Umberg’s Senate Bill 27 becomes law, people who experience psychotic symptoms as a result of bipolar disorder would qualify for the program.
The program as it stands is not broken, the senator said, it’s a “work in progress” that needs some tweaking to reach its full potential.
“To some degree, expectations were raised, some that were accurate, some that were not accurate, that this was going to be a panacea,” Umberg said. “And I never thought of it that way.”
But it’s unclear how many more people could enter into CARE Court as a result of Umberg’s bill. His office has no estimate, and other guesses vary widely. San Diego County says the bill could increase its numbers by anywhere from 3.5% to 48.1%.
Many disability rights organizations strongly oppose the bill, saying it will significantly expand an ineffective program, doing nothing to solve underlying issues of housing shortages and inadequate mental health services
“They’re not trying to fix a problem, they’re trying to deliver political optics, and that’s all this ever was,” said Lex Steppling, a founding member of All People’s Health Collective. 
Eve Garrow, a senior policy analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, said that, “given what I consider to be the failure of CARE Court so far,” she expects Umberg’s bill is primarily an effort to increase the number of petitions. 
“A court order doesn’t make resources appear out of thin air,” she said.

The state spent $88.3 million on CARE Court in the 2022-23 fiscal year, and $71.3 million in 2023-24, according to a Legislative Analyst’s Office analysis. With fewer than 550 people receiving services through the program so far, critics accuse CARE Court of wasting state money.
The Assembly Judiciary Committee’s July analysis of SB 27 described  CARE Court as a “very expensive” way to coordinate services. 
But California counties say the low numbers of CARE agreements don’t capture the entirety of the program’s impact. Even petitions that don’t lead to official agreements have afforded counties the chance to connect with and offer services to people they hadn’t previously known.
“I would say that I think the whole idea of looking at the numbers, it sort of misses the point,” said Michelle Doty Cabrera, executive director of the California Behavioral Health Directors Association. “With anything coercive, the goal is to try to engage people out of their own free will into services.” 
One of CARE Court’s successes, she said, has been in spreading the word about county services to people who might need them. If those people then express interest without the need for any coercion, “that’s a success and so far that has not been quantified,” she said.
The state has attempted to quantify that elusive number: As of December, people were diverted away from CARE Court and into other county services 1,358 times, according to a recent report from the Health and Human Services Agency.
Counties administering CARE Court also said it’s one of the few state programs that funds outreach. It can require a lot of attempts before outreach workers can coax certain people into services, they said, and this provides a mechanism to pay for those efforts.
A flood of petitions that never materialized
Eight California counties rolled out CARE Court at the end of 2023, as part of a pilot group. The rest of the state had the program up and running by December 2024.
As San Diego County counted down to the launch, officials worried they would be flooded with petitions immediately, said Amber Irvine, the county’s behavioral health program coordinator. 
The county hired nearly two-dozen people, including 10 clinicians, two psychologists and support staff to meet the expected demand. The money for those new positions came from county funds, not from the state.
That flood of petitions never materialized. 
Irvine thinks the process of filing a petition was harder than expected. Her team thought first responders, hospitals and behavioral health workers would jump at the chance to refer people into the program. But that didn’t happen. The petitioner has to attend at least the first court hearing, which is something many overworked first responders and clinicians can’t do, Irvine said.
Police and firefighters filed petitions when the program first started, but they were often dismissed – which made the first responders reluctant to file more, said Crystal Robbins, who manages a treatment referral program for San Diego Fire-Rescue.
“We quickly found out that it wasn’t a useful tool for the people that we see,” she said.

The process also is tough for families petitioning on behalf of loved ones, Irvine said. It requires them to prove their loved one has a qualifying mental health condition, but federal privacy laws can make that a big hurdle.
The county is trying to make the process less cumbersome, Irvine said. It is letting family members and some other petitioners attend court hearings virtually, for example. And in some cases, the court is allowing petitions to move on to the next step even if they don’t have all the required paperwork.
So far, San Diego County Superior Court has received the second-largest number of petitions in the state — 384, with 35% leading to CARE agreements.
But that’s still far behind initial projections.
The slow start could be a “happy accident,” Irvine said, because the low case load allows clinicians to spend more time with each CARE Court client. 
But Anita Fisher isn’t the only family member who feels discouraged about the program’s roll out in San Diego. 
Tanya Fedak said she has twice filed petitions in the county on behalf of her son, who continues to cycle between homelessness and jail despite being accepted into CARE Court.  
“These are our loved ones,” she said. “It’s our taxpayers’ money. There’s no accountability. And it’s frustrating to see it go down, because my son is going to end up dead.”  
Orange County, which was part of the initial CARE Court cohort, expected to receive 1,400 petitions and establish between 400 and 600 treatment plans its first year. Two years later, it has received at least 176 petitions , reached 14 CARE agreements and ordered one CARE plan, according to the county’s behavioral health department. That doesn’t include additional petitions that could have been dismissed by the court before reaching the county.
Orange County was the only superior court in the state with a significant number of petitions that did not disclose its data to CalMatters.   
Veronica Kelley, director of the Orange County Health Care Agency, said she never expected to reach as many people as the original estimate. She attributed that in part to the county already reaching many people with schizophrenia spectrum disorder through its existing assisted outpatient treatment program (the program created by the law Newsom criticized at the 2023 press conference), which provides similar services to CARE Court.
Kelley believes expanding the older program would have been a better use of the resources now going to CARE Court. In part, she said, that’s because Orange County’s assisted outpatient program makes it easy for people to ask the county for help, whereas filing a CARE petition is “a laborious process” that requires significant work from the petitioner.
Other people blame the low CARE Court numbers on a lack of awareness.
After CARE Court rolled out in Solano County, the local branch of the National Alliance on Mental Illness hosted town halls to teach the community about the program. An in-person town hall drew about 10 people, said NAMI Solano County Executive Director Deb Demello. Two Zoom meetings drew about four people each. And they didn’t see people from the main group they were trying to reach: family members of people with a severe mental illness.
“We had very little turn out,” Demello said.

CARE Court use  varies widely county by county, with some smaller counties appearing to struggle with the resources to implement the program. Colusa County, with a population of fewer than 22,000 people on the edge of the Mendocino National Forest, told the state last year that its courts weren’t prioritizing CARE Court because of court vacancies. The county has received just one petition.
Eight small counties, including Mendocino and San Benito, said they’ve had no petitions filed. 
Some county courts refused to disclose their data to CalMatters because the numbers were too small, citing the California Rules of Court, which allow courts to withhold data if the sample size is so small that people could be identified. 
Courts are required to report limited CARE Court data to the California Judicial Council, including the number of petitions submitted, number of agreements and plans, and number of dismissals. But the council would give only statewide totals to CalMatters, not a county-by-county breakdown. 
Will expanding CARE Court help more people?
Even if someone becomes one of the few Californians represented in a CARE Court petition, it doesn’t mean they’ll get help.
In San Francisco, the majority of petitions filed end up getting dismissed – 49 of the 75 – or 65% – of those filed. That’s one of the highest dismissal rates in the state.
Some counties, including San Francisco, told CalMatters that people may still receive services even if their CARE Court petition is dismissed. But a state report released in July found that of the 160 people whose petitions were dismissed during the first nine months of CARE Court, 90 did not receive county behavioral health services. 
Of the 130 petitions dismissed in Los Angeles County between December 2023 and February of this year, 43 were dismissed because the person was already receiving “adequate mental health services,” according to a report by the county’s department of mental health. It’s the most common reason for a dismissal in that county.

Umberg wants to address that with his bill. Currently, someone can’t qualify for CARE Court if they are already “clinically stabilized” in another treatment program. Umberg’s bill would clarify that just being enrolled in an outside treatment program doesn’t mean someone is stable. He hopes that will cut down on the number of people whose petitions are dismissed even though their mental illness is not under control. 
His bill would also make it easier for the criminal justice system to funnel people into CARE Court, by allowing a judge to refer someone directly into the program if they are charged with a misdemeanor and deemed incompetent to stand trial. 
Irvine, San Diego County’s behavioral health program coordinator, is not thrilled about Umberg’s plan to expand CARE Court. The California Behavioral Health Directors Association also opposes the bill. 
Irvine takes pride in the amount of time and energy her staff put into each CARE Court client. She says they spend weeks or even months getting to know them, bringing them their favorite foods, and helping with minor tasks, such as getting a new phone, before finally convincing them to participate in the program. In at least one case, that process took as long as five months, she said.
By some accounts, San Diego County’s approach is working. It has had 10 graduations so far, the most of any county that reported that metric to CalMatters.
Adding a lot more people into the program would give clinicians less time to spend with each client, Irvine said. And Umberg’s bill doesn’t come with money to hire more staff.

The Legislature could finally change that,Susan Bustamante,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/abuse-victims-court-california/,California courts often restrict defendants who are abuse victims from using evidence of violence against them as a defense. Lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow it.,"Guest Commentary written by

Susan Bustamante is a member of the California Coalition for Women Prisoners.


Thirty years ago, I did the bravest thing I could imagine: I asked for help.
I had survived years of childhood sexual abuse by my father, followed by a violently abusive marriage. For years my husband beat me, threatened me, forced me into isolation and even forced me to have an abortion.
I endured it and stayed quiet until I couldn’t anymore. I had two daughters to protect.
When I confided in my brother and explained what was happening, I believed I was taking a first step toward freedom. I never expected my husband would be killed and that I would be charged with his death, accused of plotting to collect a life insurance payout.
I believed the truth would protect me, that if the courts knew about the years of abuse, they would understand. However, at trial I was barred from discussing the years of trauma, fear and violence. Antiquated laws meant my truth was silenced. 
I was sentenced to life without parole.
This was not justice, but I am not alone. A Stanford University survey of women incarcerated in California for murder or manslaughter found nearly 75% had experienced intimate partner violence the year before their offense.
California law allows courts to ignore that context — even when a person’s actions were the direct result of agony, coercion or desperation. Survivors often are punished without being able to tell their full story.
If Assembly Bill 938 passes, it would give survivors a chance to present evidence of abuse and trauma. This testimony isn’t just a defense; it’s a crucial part of the truth. It ensures that what came before a moment of crisis is not erased.
We’ve seen some progress in recent years. More survivors of human trafficking are getting a chance to clear their criminal records, which often resulted from their exploitation. That has made a difference: It has brought families together and reopened doors to jobs, housing and healing.
But many other survivors of trafficking, domestic violence, and child abuse are still denied relief because current law is too narrow. Their suffering is pushed aside. Their records follow them for life. 
Abusers and traffickers often force their victims to commit crimes. They use illegal acts as tools of control and threats of exposure as a leash. This results in survivors facing lengthy prison sentences while the abuse they endured is left out of the courtroom entirely.
AB 938 would allow judges to hear about the years of psychological manipulation and impossible choices survivors have to make. It doesn’t create loopholes; it creates fairness. It doesn’t excuse harm; it acknowledges harm that was already done.
When survivors are believed and supported, they can do more than just survive. They heal. They raise families. They rebuild their communities. But that only happens when the justice system sees them as whole people with whole stories.
Though I was sentenced to die in prison, I was granted commutation in 2017. I came home to a world that had moved on without me. I’d missed my daughters’ weddings and my grandchildren’s births — moments I’ll never get back. 
Yet I carried on and reconnected with my family. I’m building a life with the time I have left. I don’t need pity. I needed a court that listened.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081225_Jury-Duty_AH_CM_41.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-02 08:56:35.286335
,California,2025-09-02 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,They were convicted of gang crimes. New California Supreme Court rulings trim their sentences,Joe Garcia and Nigel Duara,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2025/09/gang-enhancements-three-strikes/,"Two new California Supreme Court rulings sided with prisoners contesting past gang-related charges, decisions that could affect 'three strikes' cases.","In summary
Two new California Supreme Court rulings sided with prisoners contesting past gang-related charges, decisions that could affect ‘three strikes’ cases.


The California Supreme Court handed down two decisions last week that could impact decades of sentencing for gang-related offenses and allow thousands of people to petition courts to reexamine their cases. 
Both rulings turned on a 2021 law that raised the standard of evidence for proving that someone broke a law as part of  “criminal street gang activity.” In different ways, the Supreme Court chose to apply the new standard to past convictions.
One decision took an incarcerated person off Death Row; the other sided with two incarcerated people who contested past “strikes” on their records that set them on course for lengthy sentences. 
It’s uncertain how far-reaching the two rulings will be. Both of them came in split decisions, reflecting disagreements about how to apply the 2021 law retroactively. 
In one case, a 4-3 majority determined that prior gang-related charges did not hold up under new legal standards and thus could not be used as strikes.
Larry Fletcher and Eric Anthony Taylor Jr. argued that 2015 gang enhancement convictions could not be applied as “strikes” toward a three-strikes sentence for a 2020 attempted murder, as their convictions were still under appeal when the 2021 law went into effect.
The California Supreme Court ultimately agreed and vacated the 2015 prior convictions as gang-related and therefore offenses that no longer counted as a “strike” — remanding the trial court to potentially retry them under the new law’s redefined elements of gang offenses and enhancements.
It remains unclear exactly how far the Fletcher and Taylor decision will set precedent for other individuals looking to reverse life sentences under the “three strikes” law.
Chief Justice Patricia Guerrero dissented from the decision. She warned that applying the gang enhancement law to past strikes would set a legal standard that would be “virtually impossible to meet”. 
She admonished her fellow justices for invoking “the authority to change the Three Strikes law under the guise of interpreting it.”
Overturning a death sentence
A second case, ruled on Thursday, upended a defendant’s death sentence and remanded his case back to trial court. 
The case was decided 5-2, upholding Jason Aguirre’s 2009 murder and attempted murder convictions, but sending it back to trial court in Orange County for what the court described as “further proceedings.”  Both the majority and dissenting opinions said they would have reversed the defendant’s gang enhancements. 
Aguirre was a late-20s white man who prosecutors allege hung out with a Vietnamese youth gang called the Dragon Family Junior in Orange County. 
One night in 2003, he and a few younger accomplices chased a group of people from a restaurant to a cul-de-sac where members of the group crashed their car. Aguirre shot three of them, and one, 13-year-old Minh Tran, died. 
At trial, a detective testified that Aguirre shot three people for the reputational benefit of the gang. At the time, that was a valid reason for a prosecutor to pursue gang enhancements to a defendant’s sentence. 
But the 2021 law changed that. Now, the law says that gang enhancements have to show that any benefit the gang received from criminal activity has to be “‘more than reputational.”
“Understandably, given when the trial below took place, defendant’s jury was not given instructions that track the revised language of (the 2021 law),” Guerrero wrote in the majority opinion. 
“With the relevant aspects of Assembly Bill 333 (the 2021 law) applying retroactively, this disconnect with the law as it has since been amended constitutes error affecting defendant’s conviction for active participation in a criminal street gang.”
Gang enhancements in tough-on-crime era
Gang enhancements and so-called three-strike sentences date back decades, to when California’s crime numbers were peaking in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
State legislators in 1988 enacted the Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention (STEP) Act in response to rising gang crime and violence, notably most visible in Los Angeles neighborhoods.
Participation or association with an alleged gang or gang members became highly subjective criminal acts that added sentencing enhancements for felonies committed “to benefit a criminal street gang.”
Then, during the era of the so-called “super predator,” voters in 2000 approved Proposition 21, which expanded the provisions of the STEP Act and increased mandatory sentencing for gang-related crimes.
Over the next two decades, local prosecutors in California pursued allegations of criminal street gang activity for both violent and nonviolent felony charges.
Critics, activists and reform advocates argued that gang allegations and gang enhancements disproportionately and unfairly targeted defendants from minority and low-income communities — and that low thresholds of evidence led to prejudiced juries, resulting in disproportionately severe sentences, primarily for people of color.
In 2021, the STEP Forward Act — legislation authored by then-Assembly member Sydney Kamlager-Dove of Los Angeles — attempted to address the inequities and excessive punitive impact of the original STEP Act and its amendments. The STEP Forward Act is the law at the center of the two new California Supreme Court rulings.
It substantially changed the criteria by which convicted felonies could be categorized as gang-related or established as a “pattern” of gang activity, and further required courts to honor a defense request for separate proceedings to determine such gang allegations.
“Current gang enhancement statutes criminalize entire neighborhoods historically impacted by poverty, racial inequality, and mass incarceration as they punish people based on their cultural identity, who they know, and where they live,” the bill stated.

(Photo Courtesy of the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation) It was the deadliest massacre of indigenous people in U.S. history. But today, many still don’t know the story. 
It was 1863, on an icy January morning, at dawn. Hundreds of members of the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation were sleeping where they had settled for the winter along the Bear River, or as they call it, “Wuda Ogwa.” 
The Shoshone Nation were a nomadic tribe, but every winter they would make this place their home, near what’s now known as Preston, Idaho. There, they’d fish for trout and hunt game birds. Hot springs nearby warmed the ground, heating their tepees and lodges, and giving their horses a place to graze in an otherwise frost-bitten landscape. 
But that day, the tribe was nearly entirely wiped out. 
U.S. military soldiers — led by Col. Patrick Edward Connor — set out from Ft. Douglas, Utah, toward Chief Bear Hunter’s camp, reportedly in retaliation for Shoshoni raids. The soldiers killed an estimated 300, including women and children, according to historians, though tribal leaders say it was more, closer to 500. Connor reported his troops counted 224 bodies, destroyed more than 70 lodges, seized 175 horses, and captured 160 women and children, according to National Park Service records. 
Though they were few, some of the Northwestern Band survived. Today, their descendants are working to reclaim the site of the massacre as their home — and restore its natural ecosystem. 
“This is a graveyard. This is our Arlington Cemetery,” Brad Parry, vice chairman of the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation’s tribal council, said in a PBS documentary about the tribe’s restoration project. “This is where our people had to fight for their freedom to exist.” 


“I want to take this land back in time, to when it was wild,” Parry continues. “And restore our connection to it.” 
Parry and other tribal leaders held a forum Wednesday at the Northwestern Band’s tribal office in Ogden, Utah, to share the massacre’s history — and also share how the tribe is working to restore the land. 
There, Parry told a room of more than 140 people that his grandmother, Mae Timbimboo Parry, learned about the massacre directly from her grandfather, Yeager Timbimboo, who was about 12 years old when the attack happened. To survive, he hid among dead bodies.
“He laid on the frozen ground, playing dead,” Parry said. “A soldier saw him playing dead, raised his rifle at him three times, but didn’t shoot.” 
Now, more than 160 years later, Parry is leading the effort to give the site of the massacre new life. Though its history is fraught with horrific bloodshed, Parry told Utah News Dispatch that tribal leaders want to turn their grief into healing. 
“We’ve wallowed long enough. We’ve been sad long enough. This has been detrimental long enough. Let’s flip the script,” he said. “Let’s take it back to what our ancestors would recognize and start bringing the community back to the land. And not just indigenous communities, but all communities.”

Since the Bear River Massacre, the Northwestern Band hasn’t had any land to call home. Their tribe was never given a reservation. 
But in 2018, the tribe purchased about 350 acres of land around the massacre site. Their goal, Parry said, is to restore it to its wild, natural state, and to help the river’s ecosystem thrive. 
And because all things in nature are connected — what happens in one ecosystem can affect another — the efforts to restore that section of the Bear River can have a cascading effect on a downstream neighbor that’s in dire need. 
How the Wuda Ogwa restoration could bring more water to the Great Salt Lake
The Bear River is the largest tributary of the Great Salt Lake, which has been shrinking to dangerously low levels due to drought, climate change and water diversion for agriculture and development. Today, the lake remains on the brink of ecological collapse. 
The drying Great Salt Lake poses an existential threat to not only the wildlife that rely on its waters and wetlands, but also to people. Less water means more exposed lake bed, leading to dust storms laced with cancer-causing carcinogens like arsenic. In Utah, leaders are all in agreement — for the sake of Utah’s future, the Great Salt Lake must be saved. 
And the Wuda Ogwa restoration project could play a part.

Tribal leaders say researchers’ models have predicted that the restoration of Bear River natural habitats could help send an estimated 13,000 acre-feet of water to the Great Salt Lake a year by ripping out water-sucking invasive plants and replacing them with native plants, cleaning out creeks, and restoring old agricultural fields to wetlands. 



This article is published through the Great Salt Lake Collaborative, a solutions journalism initiative that partners news, education and media organizations to help inform people about the plight of the Great Salt Lake — and what can be done to make a difference before it is too late.


The Great Salt Lake needs every drop of water it can get, so that amount of water isn’t insignificant — but it would far from solve the lake’s crisis. It needs about 8 to 15 more vertical feet of water (the equivalent of two Bear Lakes) to be healthy, according to the Great Salt Lake Collaborative. 
And whether that water will actually flow all the way to the Great Salt Lake is still an open question. The tribe has secured water rights for the project, Parry said, but because it crosses state lines, tribal leaders have encountered challenges from leaders in Idaho during water rights adjudication discussions. 
“One of the biggest problems that we’ve found is the state above you — their users don’t care about the Great Salt Lake,” Parry said. “I can say that because we’ve been involved in adjudication, and instead of asking how they can protect their water rights, (they ask), ‘Are you guys doing this for the Great Salt Lake?’”
Asked to clarify those comments, Parry told Utah News Dispatch that in talking with Idaho state officials and irrigation farming districts in Idaho, “their goal isn’t to help us save the Great Salt Lake.” 
Parry said the tribe has its own, primary reasons for wanting to restore the land and the wetlands — but the benefits to the Great Salt Lake would be a positive consequence of the restoration that the tribe also supports. 
He added that tribal leaders have found that the further away from the Great Salt Lake, there’s less interest in helping save it. But he argued “we’re all in this together,” and the impacts from toxic dust from the dried lake bed would be far-reaching, including potentially in other states like Idaho.
“If the states don’t start working with each other, it’s never going to happen,” he said.  
The Wuda Ogwa restoration project
Parry said the tribe has secured roughly $13 million in various state and federal grants and other funding sources for the river restoration project. 
During Wednesday’s forum, tribal leaders and researchers detailed how after the Bear River Massacre, colonial settlement transformed what was once the Bear River’s natural bends and wetlands into farm and grazing land. Since then, it has become a shadow of what it once was. 
Now, thanks to the help of volunteers on weeding and planting days, the tribe is working to remove invasive plants and replace them with native vegetation. They’re also working with engineers and biologists to reshape the river and its wetlands to a more natural state to help attract back fish, birds and other wildlife.

One of the biggest foes they’re working to root out is the Russian Olive. The thorny, invasive tree that sucks up massive amounts of water has taken over the river shoreline.  
Brian Andrew, an engineer at the firm Hansen Allen and Luce that’s been hired by the tribe for the project, said there are an estimated 400,000 Russian Olive plants on a 60-acre area of the site. A mature Russian Olive tree consumes an estimated 75 gallons of water a day and crowds out other native plants like willows and cottonwoods. 
Early in the project, Parry said tribal leaders envisioned building a geothermal heated amphitheater and cultural interpretative center. But he said the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted funding, and construction costs have since skyrocketed. 
Now, Parry said the tribe is focused on restoring the land first and foremost, now envisioning a trail system as a way for members of the public to experience the wetlands once they’re thriving. 
So far, the tribe’s partners estimate they’ve planted and seeded about 69,000 native plants over 111 acres. Between 2025 and 2027, they expect to plant an additional 130,000 over 250 acres. 
Parry said with $13 million in funding that’s already been secured, they’ve made good progress — but he said tribal leaders continue to ask for donations since “we’re always looking for funding,” especially for monitoring the project’s impact on the ecosystem. 
“Another $5 to $10 million wouldn’t hurt,” he said.

State Prison dates back to 1836 and has tiny cells with no hot water, privacy, or air conditioning, a new report says.","Some wings in the oldest portions of the New Jersey State Prison in Trenton date back nearly 200 years. The smallest cells, like the one pictured, measure four by seven feet. (Photo courtesy of New Jersey Office of the Corrections Ombudsperson)Over a century ago, New Jersey corrections officials and advocates called on lawmakers to demolish and replace the state prison in Trenton, declaring the facility outdated, inadequate, and “wholly unsuited for the present needs either of the inmates or of the officers.”
Lawmakers did not act on that 1918 call to action or several subsequent pleas for change, and today, more than 1,300 people are incarcerated in New Jersey State Prison — considered the oldest operating prison in America, with one section built in 1836, according to a new watchdog report.
Now the state corrections ombudsperson’s office has joined the chorus urging lawmakers to raze and rebuild the maximum-security lockup’s oldest wings, where people have spent decades in closet-sized cells with no hot water, no privacy, no recreation space or day room, and such sweltering temperatures in the summer that many sleep on the floor to stay cool.
“Hundreds of people are living in the prison’s West Compound in cells small enough that they can extend their arms and touch both side-walls and the ceiling,” state Ombudsperson Terry Schuster wrote in a report released Tuesday. “The buildings in the West Compound were constructed nearly 200 years ago, and have been called antiquated and inhumane by New Jersey correctional leaders, policymakers, and subject matter experts for at least the last 100 years.”
Department spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment.
While two of the prison’s three compounds were built in the 1980s with modern temperature control and housing unit design, its west compound has seven housing units that were built between 1836 and 1905, according to the report. The compound’s smallest cells measure just four feet by seven feet, and its oldest housing units were designed for solitary confinement, the report says.
More than 600 people live there, with over a third of its general-population residents serving life sentences, according to the report.
Kory McClary, who has lived at the prison since 2013, described the cells in the west compound as “cages for rotting men” in a 2024 essay.
Living there is “like living in an abandoned building,” he wrote. “I’m in a single cell about the size of a small walk-in closet — half the size of the cells in the south compound. With my books and coolers strewn around the cell, I only get two steps into my pacing before I have to turn around. The windows rattle, creak and swing back and forth when the wind blows. Guys holler all day.”

Investigators noted that officials have repeatedly urged lawmakers to replace the prison’s oldest portions.
After prison riots in 1952, a committee held public hearings and issued a report to then-Gov. Alfred Driscoll that denounced the prison as “one of the most archaic in the United States” and exhorted lawmakers to build a new facility rather than taking “piecemeal and temporary measures to stave off the ravages of old age,” the report says.
It was slated for demolition at least twice before. Its end was so expected in the 1980s that preservationists photographed the building for historic building archives, the report says. And in 2011, the Department of Corrections sought state funds to demolish and rebuild it, citing class-action litigation over confinement conditions and warning that inaction would compromise security and force officials “to maintain the old systems at extremely high costs.”
“Maintaining the West Compound of the prison has required immense effort on the part of the facility’s staff and leadership over the last century-plus, and has cost New Jersey taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars,” Schuster wrote.
Schuster urged lawmakers and department officials to prioritize and fund the demolition and reconstruction of the west compound. Past estimates for such work have ranged from $200 million to $400 million, he added. Absent that, officials should relocate west compound residents to safer, more modern housing units, Schuster recommended.
Lawmakers also should adopt standards for the size of single- and double-occupancy cells to ensure prison conditions are humane, Schuster said. He noted that the state’s administrative code regulates the size of county jail cells, requiring a minimum of 35 square feet of free floor space in a single-occupancy cell, yet has no minimum standard for the size of state prison cells.
He also recommended that department officials create more privacy in the compound’s showers and provide residents with free, standard-size bath towels, instead of the smaller towels they now get. Prison staff told Schuster’s investigators that many residents bathe in their underwear for privacy in a washroom that has just small dividers between showering spaces.
Corrections officials have closed a number of state prisons in recent years, including Jones Farm in Ewing and Southern State Correctional Facility in Delmont. Officials also plan to close the East Jersey State Prison in Woodbridge and the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women in Clinton.
Like New Jersey State Prison’s west compound, though, the state has stumbled and stalled in its efforts to close other abhorred lockups, including two prisons for juveniles.

(Andi Rice for Alabama Reflector)BIRMINGHAM — Robert Cheeks cast a ballot in Birmingham’s municipal elections last week and received a standing ovation from poll workers.
It was the first time that Cheeks, 82, had voted. Until the most recent election, his criminal history barred him from participating in the electoral process.
“I had never voted before and it was always my wish to vote,” he said after he cast his ballot. “I had the opportunity, encouraged, to vote, and I said I want to exercise my right as a citizen in the state, and I wanted to vote because I had never voted before.”

For Black Alabamians like Cheeks who have criminal convictions, getting the right to vote restored can be difficult, according to a new report from Return My Vote, an organization that assists people with criminal convictions with regaining their right to vote.
The study, “Alabama’s Moral Turpitude Law Disproportionately Strips Black Citizens of Their Voting Rights,” found that Black Alabamians were four times more likely to lose their right to vote than white Alabamians.
“The most basic, and most important, finding is that overall that people who were dropped from the voter file or denied registration due to felony conviction, a majority of them were Black,” said Richard Fording, a professor of political science at the University of Alabama and a co-author of the study. “Not a large majority, but over 50% of them were Black. It was about twice the percentage of the general population that is Black in Alabama, and so, of course that is alarming.”
Alabama laws generally deny the vote to those convicted of crimes of moral turpitude, a broad phrase that was subject to interpretation until the state began listing specific crimes under it in 2017. While some states automatically restore voting rights after a person completes a sentence, Alabama has a more complicated process.
While only a handful of crimes can permanently cost a person their vote, some require pardons from the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles. Others require a Certificate of Eligibility to Register to Vote once they have completed their sentence, which includes payment of any fines, fees and restitution.
The authors of the study studied 25,000 people removed from the voter rolls or disqualified from voting between 2017 and 2020 due to criminal conviction. Study authors were able to review the information only after the Campaign Legal Center had obtained the records after a federal judge had required the Alabama Secretary of State’s Office to release it.
Disparities
According to the study, Black men were disenfranchised at a rate of 22.4 citizens per 1,000 men of voting age. That is almost four times the rate for their white counterparts, whose rate was 6.7 citizens per 1,000.
The rate for disenfranchising Black women was 3.9 citizens per 1,000, almost twice the rate of white women, whose disenfranchisement rate was 2.1 citizens per 1,000 white women.
Counties with significant Black populations had some of the highest Black disenfranchisement rates and largest racial disparities in disenfranchisement. Seven of the 10 counties with the highest rates of disenfranchised voters are within the Black Belt. The rate for disenfranchising Black men in Monroe, more than 40% Black, was 40.6, compared to 8 per 1,000 for white men. In Perry County, with a Black population of 70%, the rate was 30 citizens per 1,000 Black men of voting age. The rate was 11.4 for white men, almost three times lower.
The disparities are less pronounced for women in the same counties, but they still exist. In Monroe County, Black women are disenfranchised at a rate of 5.6 citizens per 1,000 Black women who are at least 18 years old. For white women in that county, the rate is 2.4, less than half.
Study authors stated in the report that even though there is some uncertainty with the information because of problems collecting data, after reviewing the Uniform Crime Report data obtained from the FBI website, the findings indicated that more Blacks are disenfranchised than whites even when criminal convictions are considered.
“Nevertheless, the most important takeaway is that the disproportionate percentage of arrests for disqualifying offenses by Blacks in Alabama (42%) cannot fully account for the significantly higher percentage of Blacks disenfranchised by the state (52%) during 2017-2021,” the report states.
The study also found that Blacks have a more difficult time regaining their right to vote after they are removed from the voter rolls after getting convicted of a crime.
Authors also investigated the number of people who were removed from the voter rolls from 2017-2021 who had regained their voting rights and registered to vote once again by 2024. According to the study, 1,034 people who are Black reregistered to vote after they completed their sentence, about 8.3% of the total. That is less than the almost 13% of whites registered to vote after a criminal conviction.
The study suggested that the disparities could stem from disparities in the application of Alabama’s felony disenfranchisement law and uneven methods of voter file maintenance in the state.
“Regardless of the reason, the significant variation in county-level disenfranchisement rates calls for further investigation into how Alabama’s felony disenfranchisement law is being implemented at the local level,” the report said. “This is especially important given federal law that requires uniform implementation of state election laws across counties.”
‘It means so much’
Cheeks spent almost 40 years in the custody of the Alabama Department of Corrections after receiving a mandatory life sentence in 1985 for a robbery. Cheeks had prior convictions of forgery and assault, leading to the sentence but no one was physically injured. Cheeks spent 30 years working in the kitchen at Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer without pay, according to Alabama Appleseed.
Cheeks was released in July 2022. His criminal convictions required him to obtain a Certificate of Eligibility to Register to Vote, which he applied for and received from the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles. Cheeks, with the help of supporters, then registered to vote with the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County and acquired full citizenship once again after spending nearly four decades incarcerated in Alabama’s prisons.
“It is more important now than it would have been in the first place,” Cheeks said of voting. “I have been so anxious over the years to vote. I have been hearing so much about voting, and I wanted to express my opportunity for the right to vote. It is granted to American citizens by right, and I wanted to do that. I am so thankful. It is a blessing, and it means so much.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Robert-Cheeks-for-Sept-2-2025.jpeg,,,2025-09-02 08:56:35.286335

The awards honor excellence in digital journalism around the world.


CalMatters is a finalist for general excellence and social media engagement amongst medium-sized newsrooms in the 2025 Online News Awards.
In each size category, ONA’s general excellence award “honors a digitally focused news organization that successfully fulfills its editorial mission, effectively serves its audience, maximizes the use of digital tools and platforms and represents the highest journalistic standards.”
CalMatters is a finalist for general excellence along with ProPublica, Mother Jones/Center for Investigative Reporting and The Texas Tribune. CalMatters’ honor is for work, including our nonpartisan voter information efforts, groundbreaking Digital Democracy platform and every day coverage helping millions of people make sense of California and how its government works.

Our stories and tools made government actions and decisions relatable, held leaders accountable and gave Californians vital information to engage with their government – resulting in impacts felt across the state. In journalism, impact can take seconds or it can take years. When it comes to big issues we bring persistent, accountability coverage, and this year, we’ve seen that result in widespread impact: a California state audit (triggered by a 2023 CalMatters investigation) found that a law meant to reveal who funds state legislators’ sponsored travel is falling short, state legislators advanced a new bill to increase homeless shelter oversight (directly citing an ongoing CalMatters investigation on conditions inside homeless shelters), and California’s political watchdog fined a former lawmaker $106,000 for campaign finance violations (after a 2020 CalMatters story). This is only a fraction of the impact we’ve had.
Our Voter Guide has been a powerhouse resource that has helped Californians figure out how they want to vote. This year, we reached our widest audience thus far, by meeting voters where they were. We created TikTok videos and filters, launched an interactive ballot preview tool, partnered with local publications to show readers articles relevant to their ballot, created magazine-style quizzes that hundreds of Californians used at 40+ in-person events, printed a Voter Guide zine, added Chinese and Korean translations in addition to Spanish, and a version for English learners. One in five California voters used our guide.
Our Digital Democracy platform, launched in 2024, shows video and transcripts from every hearing, logs every vote, provides data on lobbyists and an easy way to track bills. We’ve also trained journalists in 20+ newsrooms on how to use our AI-generated tipsheets. With the help of our tipsheets, CBS News partnered with us to reveal that California’s one-party supermajority legislature systematically avoids transparency and accountability by killing controversial legislation without voting on the record. Digital Democracy has two Emmy nominations and won the Poynter Institute’s Punch Sulzberger Prize for Journalism Innovation.  

CalMatters is a finalist for social media engagement among National Geographic, The Marshall Project and The Baltimore Banner. CalMatters’ honor is for our nonpartisan Voter Guide TikTok engagement efforts.

Made-for-Gen Z TikToks: We experimented a lot, failing multiple times before we found our first viral success when we started breaking down California propositions using a call center format. Our Gen Z politics reporter, Jenna Peterson, and our millennial audience engagement manager, Anna Almendrala worked hand-in-hand, creating skits where Jenna played both a confused voter, and a call center prop expert. TikTokers started paying attention, and we kept going, making and trying out organic ways to reach young voters on TikTok.
Launching our own TikTok filter: Like in previous elections, we created online interactive quizzes that helped California voters figure out where they stood on each of the statewide propositions. But in 2024, after being inspired by lighthearted beauty industry TikTok filters that asked viewers to vote for makeup by tilting their heads, we created a series of CalMatters TikTok filters asking you if you thought the rent was too damn high — and other similar questions — that could help TikTokers decide how they’d vote on the state’s ballot propositions this year. (Our demo.) Our quiz filters were used over 20,000 times in the two weeks before the election.
Working with California influencers: For the first time ever, CalMatters worked with influencers to help make sure our voter guide reached young voters on TikTok. We selected six influencers based on common criteria — they were in California, they normally posted lifestyle videos, and they thought of young adults as one of their main audiences. We also asked them to clearly disclose that CalMatters was sponsoring their post, to create videos in their own voice, and to tell their audience about our voter guide.

While some winners in the Online News Awards have already been announced, winners for general excellence and social media engagement will be announced in September at the Online News Association’s conference in New Orleans.
Last year, CalMatters was also a finalist for general excellence; and The Markup, which is also part of our news organization, won the same category for small newsrooms.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/060120_CalMattersStaff_LV__008-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-02 08:56:35.286335

I’m going to go with a dark horse candidate: the mid-19th century.
This may seem an odd choice when the Black Death and the Thirty Years’ War are on the shelf. The people of those times would have loved the technologies that made goods more plentiful and travel easier during the Victorian era.

But those cravat-wearing, girdle-trapped train passengers carried viruses and bacteria to populations with no immunity to them. The factories that made those goods triggered explosive growth in cities, far beyond society’s ability to manage the sanitation problems that resulted.
Children bore the brunt of this calamity. Infant mortality rates were horrifically high and even higher if you were poor, Black or Native American. Life expectancy as a whole fell in the first half of the 19th century. Many of those who survived adolescence experienced stunted growth or carried health problems for the rest of their lives. According to “Health and Wellness in 19th Century America” by John C. Waller, a soldier in the Civil War was, on average, an inch shorter than a soldier who served in World War II and an inch shorter than a soldier who served in the American Revolution.
I wouldn’t want to live in 1750, but when it comes to public health, I might prefer it to 1850. Progress is neither preordained nor secure from reversals. And we have examples of this in our own lifetime.
Take measles. The first vaccine against the disease hit the market in 1963. The MMR shot – the one most of us over the age of 20 got – came along in 1971. Both these vaccines were safe and effective against a disease that once killed 2 million people around the world each year. In 2000, authorities declared measles eliminated in the United States.
But that didn’t last.
A fraudulent study falsely linking vaccines to autism — which is not a disease — led to people forsaking the shot and empowered all kinds of con artists to attack science and scientists. In the first three months of 2025, the United States had more reported measles cases than in all 2024.
Now measles has reached Alabama.
The Alabama Department of Public Health reported last week that a 5-year-old child tested positive for the disease, the first confirmed case of measles in the state in over 20 years.
But it won’t take another 20 years to see the second case. Health care experts say we need 95% vaccine coverage to prevent the spread of measles. Alabama’s rate among kindergarteners was 95.2% last year.  That’s good because it was 93.8% the year before, setting off alarm bells at the health department. Yearly swings like these are becoming common and will only endanger children.
Facing these risks, we need political leaders who listen to health care experts; take disease seriously and rebuke the charlatans putting families in danger.
Here’s what we have now.
For the last several years, Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, has pushed legislation to expand Alabamians’ ability to claim “religious exemptions” from vaccinations. These exemptions are largely anti-vaxxer nonsense. Few, if any, religions ban their adherents from getting vaccinated.
Orr’s bill passed the Senate this spring. It failed to move in the House. But Rep. Mack Butler, R-Rainbow City, has already prefiled a new version of the bill for next year’s session. (It would allow college students to claim the same exemption, a perfect way to spread disease among stressed-out people living in tight quarters.)
Then there’s our allegedly inevitable next governor. U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville has suggested mandatory vaccinations in the Armed Forces hurt recruitment. Because nothing says military readiness more than a bunch of sick soldiers.
Last December, the Republican appeared to signal agreement with now-U.S. health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that babies were getting too many vaccines. He followed that up during Kennedy’s confirmation hearing earlier this year with an announcement that his granddaughter wouldn’t be “a pincushion.”
There’s Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, now a candidate for U.S. Senate, who falsely claimed in 2022 that the COVID-19 vaccine was ineffective. His opponent in the Republican primary, U.S. Rep. Barry Moore, appears to agree with Tuberville’s make-’em-sick approach to national defense, demanding in a 2021 letter to the U.S. Department of Defense that service members not get vaccinated against COVID-19.
Here’s your future, Alabama. A bunch of leaders captured by the virus lobby.
I hope this poor 5-year-old who caught measles recovers. I hope it doesn’t spread. The severe respiratory illness and rash is miserable even when it’s not deadly.
But when we get our second measles case, will we have a government acting to protect us? Or will our politicians watch children get ill — or worse — and mumble something about freedom?
All the evidence points to the latter. And an Alabama political class inexplicably undoing decades of public health gains.
This may not be the Victorian era. But unlike us, the Victorians didn’t choose to live in a world where children needlessly died.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/19th-century-illustration-of-illness-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-02 08:56:35.286335

This story was originally reported by Nadra Nittle of The 19th.  Meet Nadra and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Second-grade teacher Demetria Richardson spends so much on school supplies she has a designated credit card to cover classroom expenses. Just don’t tell her husband what the balance is, she said. Usually, the 26-year veteran educator in Richmond, Virginia, spends about $500 on back-to-school items. Over the past month, she has already topped that — and she’s not done shopping.
Crowdfunding on DonorsChoose, a nonprofit that lets individuals fund public school classroom projects, helps Richardson cover some of the costs on items like dry erase markers, pencils and printer ink. The school supply-stuffed backpacks that local churches distribute to families before the school year also help, Richardson said. Yet, none of this assistance stretches far enough to prevent teachers like her from dipping into their own wallets to serve students.
While covering the cost of classroom supplies is a challenge educators face annually, the burden on them has grown as the price of many learning materials has jumped by 20 percent in roughly five years.

“By the end of September,” Richardson estimated, the total on her credit card for school is “probably going to be close to $1,200.”
President Donald Trump’s tariffs on foreign goods — and the supply chain disruptions that resulted — have partly been blamed for driving up the cost of school supplies. His freeze of over $6 billion in education funding on July 1, which he reversed before the end of that month, added to the problem by preventing schools, including Title I schools with large populations of economically disadvantaged students, from stocking classrooms with learning materials well ahead of the academic year.
“It’s hard to understand that teachers have to buy all these supplies for themselves, for their classrooms and for students,” said Emma García, principal researcher for the Learning Policy Institute, a nonprofit that conducts research to improve education policy and practice. “I don’t think there’s any other profession in which the professional has to shoulder the supplies or the materials. But for teachers, it’s taken for granted that they will be there, that they are going to do the work no matter what.”
Research indicates that virtually no educators are spared from spending their own money on their classrooms, according to García. Teachers at high-poverty schools told The 19th that, in addition to Trump’s tariffs and funding freeze, other factors have contributed to them paying more for goods. They pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic, when they saw prices start to rise and a cultural and economic shift in which students returned to class with few to no supplies, a trend they say persists today.
“This year has definitely been a huge challenge because typically the schools would be able to give us some of the basics, like a stapler, pencils, paper,” said Emmanuela Louis, who teaches English Language Arts for Miami-Dade County Public Schools. School officials “haven’t been able to give us anything, so it’s like we have to rely heavily on DonorsChoose to even get resources for the kids to start the school year. It pretty much puts the most vulnerable kids at risk.”
Through it all, teachers have served as the safety net children can count on when the system breaks down. Educators have taken on debt, found extra work and gone without much-needed personal items to prepare their classrooms — and their students — for another school year.

The person sacrifices behind school supplies

For Richardson, shelling out hundreds of dollars of her own money on school supplies means she won’t be able to buy the $150 pair of stylish Vionic orthopedic shoes that make it easier for her to stand all day.
“People think that we don’t like to look nice, too,” Richardson said. “We want to get a new back-to-school outfit, too, or a pair of shoes. But when it comes to our students, our students come first, and we go on the back burner.”
Louis knows the feeling: Some years she has barely been able to afford back-to-school footwear and apparel herself. During others, she has gone without these items entirely because she had funneled so much money into her classroom at Jose De Diego Middle School in Miami. Although her district provides her with a $300 school supply stipend, a purchase as mundane as copy paper devours those funds instantly, she said.
“Three hundred dollars doesn’t go far at all,” said Louis, who has taught for 16 years. “When you’re thinking of supplies — folders and things like that — they’re not cheap. You’re buying at least three folders per student just to keep their items organized. Paper is also a necessity to copy things for them. We do have laptops, which kind of helps, but they don’t always go home with them, so they definitely need tangible items in their hands to write and copy things down.”
Altogether, Louis estimates that during any given school year, she spends about $2,500 to $3,000 on her classroom and students. And that doesn’t include the money the mother of two spends on supplies for her own children, a third-grader and a ninth-grader.
Richardson’s classroom expenditures aren’t far behind, as she has spent as much as $2,000 outfitting her classroom at Henry L. Marsh III Elementary in Richmond throughout the school year. That’s well above the average educators spend on supplies, DonorsChoose has found, backing up previous research that revealed teachers at high-needs schools have more out-of-pocket expenses.
“We ran a teacher survey earlier this spring, and we noticed that teachers are spending, on average, $655 of their own money on school supplies for their students and for their classroom,” said Kristina “Steen” Joye Lyles, vice president of equity and impact at DonorsChoose. “That’s an increase from what teachers reported last year, which was $610.”
Without DonorsChoose, Lyles said, teachers reported that they’d be spending over $1,400 of their own money on school supplies annually. “So, this is a trend that we’re watching closely.”
García said paying for school supplies compounds financial pressures for teachers, who earn lower salaries compared with professionals in other careers that require college or graduate degrees. Moreover, teachers often take on student loan debt just to enter the field. Given this, any out-of-pocket costs are “going to be more burdensome for a teacher than for a non-teacher” covering work-related expenses, García contends. And the $300 deduction for classroom expenditures educators can claim on federal income tax returns hardly levels the playing field.
Richardson has felt obligated to subsidize her students’ needs with her own money because she teaches at a Title I school where nearly every pupil qualifies for free or reduced lunch. Some years, most of her classroom expenses have gone toward snacks for students.
“Some parents send their own snacks, but we do have a lot of kids whose parents don’t, so we hate to see them sitting there needing that extra boost of energy but not having it,” she said. “You’re talking about snacks for maybe 20 kids, five times a week. That does add up.”
Also adding up is the rising cost of school supplies. This year, Richardson has paid more for crayons, glue sticks, composition books, folders and other materials than she remembers paying in recent years.
“I used to get folders for 50 cents apiece,” she said. “Now they’re almost 95 cents a folder. We used to be able to get boxes of crayons, but we can’t get them in bulk at the dollar store anymore. They said supply is low. Now, they’re like almost $2 for a 16-count box.”










I used to get folders for 50 cents apiece. Now they're almost 95 cents a folder. We used to be able to get boxes of crayons, but we can't get them in bulk at the dollar store anymore. They said supply is low. Now, they're like almost $2 for a 16-count box.


– Demetria Richardson, Virginia educator


Louis can no longer afford to give each of her 125 students a small box of crayons, along with a kit filled with rulers, index cards and highlighters. This year, she said, groups of four students will have to share these school supply kits. Sharing them means that her students can’t take the kits home to complete their schoolwork.
Since her students are required to wear uniforms consisting of polo shirts and navy or khaki pants, Louis has also spent her own money to make sure her sixth graders, many of whom come from migrant families who can’t afford more than one uniform, have multiple sets of these clothing items.
“The uniforms have gone up tremendously,” she said. “It used to cost $6 or $7 for a shirt. Now they’re between $9 to $12.”
As classes resumed in Richmond, Richardson had already spent $200 on composition books and $400 on durable headphones for her students that wouldn’t break like the cheap ones she had in her classroom last school year. New whiteboards and dry erase markers were also on her list.
A mother of four — the youngest of which is a college senior in need of her own supplies — Richardson said she’s fortunate enough to have children who pitch in to help her obtain learning materials.
“They always say, ‘Hey, Mom, I picked up some crayons for you,’ or ‘Mom, I picked up some pencils. Mom, you always said the kids never have scissors,’” Richardson said. “I’m so blessed that they do look out for me.”

The empty backpack: A post-COVID reality

Reflecting on the start of her teaching career, which coincided with the turn of the 21st century, Richardson noticed a stark difference compared with today in how parents respond to the annual supply list her school sends out.
“Earlier in my career, parents would send everything on the school supply list, and then they would send extras just in case,” she said. “If your tissue box supply ran low, you could reach out and they would replenish it.”
Today, however, students will get free bookbags from community events and bring nothing more than the bag and the supplies in it — usually one notebook, one pack of paper, one box of crayons — to school with them, Richardson said.
“If we’re lucky, that’s what they have,” she said.
Out of 125 students, Louis said that she expects “maybe not even 20 percent” to show up to school with the supplies they need. That’s about 25 students.
The COVID-19 pandemic marked a turning point, ushering in mass job losses and supply chain disruptions that made it difficult for families to pay for essentials like rent and food, let alone school supplies. When students returned to class after remote learning, many stopped bringing the items on supply lists, teachers told The 19th.
“So we tried to minimize what was on the list to be just the necessities,” Richardson said.
At her high-poverty school, most students show up with half the supplies on the back-to-school list, while about a quarter arrive completely empty-handed, she said. Some parents question why students need items like resealable plastic baggies, dry-erase markers or hand sanitizer, so they don’t purchase them. Others just haven’t been able to find items on the supply list, like the clear or mesh book bags required since July 2024 by Richmond Public Schools.
To supplement her income and easily provide her students with the appropriate learning materials, Richardson has in the past taken on extra work — teaching summer school and working as a tutor and facilitator. Doing so, she said, gave her “extra money all year round to offset what I spend in my classroom.” A DonorsChoose survey revealed that nearly half of teachers report having a second job.
“So, again, we’re just seeing this heightened level of teachers going above and beyond to be able to stay afloat during a time when things are getting really expensive,” Lyles said.
Jodi Hanauer, an ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) teacher at Juniata Park Academy in Philadelphia, has previously picked up more work, which, in part, helped her buy school supplies.
“I took on a part-time job just to pay the bills for several years,” the 22-year educator said. “I was an online ESOL teacher at night and during the weekends. I was teaching kids and adults English in countries like China, Japan and [places like] Hong Kong.”
The extra income she earned then marked the rare time buying school supplies, for which Hanauer pays between $500 to $1,000 annually, didn’t hurt financially. Like Louis, her school district provides her with a small stipend to cover learning materials, but the $200 doesn’t begin to compensate for the expenditures she makes working at a high-poverty school.
Title I funds from the federal government help schools with economically disadvantaged students to cover supply costs.  But Trump’s funding freeze in July held up Title I funding, delaying schools from getting their supply orders processed well before the new academic year.
“We haven’t been able to receive the order for this school year yet, so we’re hoping that will get cleared up soon,” Richardson said.

A stopgap, not a solution: the limits of crowdfunding

DonorsChoose helps teachers like Richardson avoid financial collapse.
She’s currently seeking donations for basic school supplies like pencils and ink for the classroom printer. She’d also like clay to help her students do classroom projects that develop their fine motor skills.
But DonorsChoose, Richardson said, is not a permanent solution to the long-standing pattern of teachers covering school supplies.
“It takes a while for the projects to be funded and then the materials to be shipped to us,” she said. “If we need poster boards for our students to do a history project, and we need them in the classroom on Friday, I have to go out and purchase 18 poster boards to make sure that all of my students have one.”
For Hanauer, DonorsChoose is no guarantee she will get all the school supplies she needs. She currently has a campaign to give prizes — which have previously included fidget spinners and high-end pens, pencils and erasers — to students who make positive behavioral choices.
“Putting up a DonorsChoose project is like a dream,” she said. “You are dreaming of getting things, and it’s great if that happens, but if you absolutely need something now or in one week, then you’re going to have to come up with the money yourself.”
For 12 years, Louis has used DonorsChoose to subsidize her classroom expenses. Since many of her students are English learners, it’s imperative that her classroom be a print-rich environment. But educational posters can cost $35 apiece, an expense that can quickly balloon. Crowdfunding on DonorsChoose has helped her cut down on these costs. She’s also used the site to fund field trips. She’s currently crowdfunding for a file cabinet and poster machine ink that can cost up to $500.
Although teachers make countless sacrifices to kick off the school year and maintain their classrooms as the months unfold, Louis knows that the public is largely unaware of how much educators personally contribute to school supply lists. Every item in a classroom, she said, has been designed with one goal in mind: facilitating student learning.
“So, please be gentle with teachers,” she asked, urging families to provide any learning materials they’re capable of buying. Teachers who pour money into their classrooms, she said,  do so “out of the kindness of our heart, because we really enjoy what we do.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Child-with-school-supplies-for-Aug-31-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-02 08:56:35.286335

Wes Moore vowed to end child poverty, he likely did not expect his efforts to face twice-impeached former President Donald Trump's return to the White House to begin what critics are calling a “War on Children,” writes Thomas Ferraro.","Gov. Wes Moore, right, vowed at the outset of his term to end child poverty, but that pledge has run into the reality of budget cuts by President Donald Trump that critics say with hit the poorest Americans. (President Donald Trump from a White House screen shot; Gov. Wes Moore photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)On Feb. 1, 2023, Gov. Wes Moore (D), in his first state-of-the-state address, promised to make Maryland the first state to end child poverty. “Maryland will lead the way,” Moore said.
The new governor likely never imagined that twice-impeached former President Donald Trump would return to the White House this year and begin what critics call a “War on Children” – widespread federal spending cuts that threaten to push more children into poverty nationwide.
In July, Moore made a new promise, saying, “I am prepared to use every tool at my disposal … to protect our people and minimize the fallout from these reckless policies.”
Moore campaigned for governor in 2022 with the slogan, “Leave no one behind.” He now uses it as a rallying cry to support those who might be hurt by Trump cuts.
An estimated 174,000 Marylanders are at risk of losing food assistance, and 144,000 Marylanders may lose health coverage from Medicaid cuts, according to the Maryland Center on Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research group.
Ben Orr, the center’s chief executive officer, writes: “While the numbers alone are staggering, behind those numbers are real people – parents who won’t be able to afford enough food for themselves and their children, families becoming homeless because they had to spend limited funds on healthcare or food instead of rent.”

In 2023, the most recent year with available data, there were about 142,000 Maryland children in poverty, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, a philanthropy dedicated to improving the lives of children. The state’s child poverty rate stood at 11%, the national rate at 16%.
Poverty is complex, which helps explain why no state has ended it. Factors include low wages, lack of affordable housing, rising costs and underfunded government programs for the poor.
In seeking to boost the economy and reduce federal “fraud, waste, and abuse,” Trump slashed grants, programs, departments, and agencies, many of which serve children, and fired tens of thousands of workers, many of them parents.
On July 3, Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” packed with spending and tax cuts — shifting wealth from the poor to the rich, from young to older — won final congressional approval, prompting him to declare, “it’s going to make this country into a rocket ship” economically.
Moore fired back that no state has the resources to “fill the massive hole” that Trump’s measure will put in “our social safety net.” In June, he told WUSA-9 that proposed cuts in food stamps, Medicaid and education would “push about 76,000 of our children, our children, into poverty. And it’s all being done so we can give millionaires a tax cut!”
In his 2023 state-of-the-state speech, Moore said, “No group deserves our help more than the children of Maryland. In a state with the highest median income in the country, one in eight children lives in poverty.”
“I know there will be skeptics,” said Moore, a former head one of the nation’s largest anti-poverty organizations.  But, he said, “We can, and we will, end child poverty in the state of Maryland.”
Moore moved quickly on several fronts, including affordable housing, raising the state minimum wage, expanding the state child tax credit and earned income tax credit, and launching The ENOUGH Act – Engaging Neighborhoods, Organizations, Unions, Governments and Households – an effort to end concentrated child poverty while constructing strong communities.
Orr says the governor “made a lot of progress” on child poverty in his first two years in office, though he now faces new challenges with Trump cuts atop a state budget deficit.
Due to those cuts, Orr says, “I certainly expect, when the data is in on the next couple of years, we will see an increase in child poverty in Maryland and the various ways harm is being done to Maryland families.”
Children are among the most vulnerable, given that those in poverty are less apt to graduate high school, and thus more likely to face joblessness, homelessness and other life problems, impacting their children and possibly grandchildren.
A month after taking office, Moore told Baltimore’s WYPR public radio, “I hope we can make enough of a dent” in child poverty in his first term “to justify” reelection, and then, during a second term, which would begin in 2027, push toward finishing the job.
Moore’s efforts in a second term may get a boost from the fact that Trump’s second term is set to end on Jan. 20, 2029, and, with it, perhaps, an end to a “War on Children.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/merged-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-02 08:56:35.286335

(Photo by Shelby Wyatt / Source NM)Moriarty Police Chief Adan Urbina and one of his officers, Christopher Costa, spent the summer of 2023 taking inventory of everything in their evidence room. The pair began the tedious work of inspecting and cataloging the boxes of seized possessions after Cpt. Mark Satterfield, the lone evidence custodian for this small police force some 40 miles east of Albuquerque, submitted his notice of resignation that June. Lifting the box of evidence for a January 2023 criminal case off its shelf, Urbina and Costa couldn’t find the seized cash that was supposed to be inside. Urbina called off the inventory effort, records show, and decided to intercept Satterfield, who was scheduled to clean out his office, the next day.
Investigative documents show that Urbina asked Satterfield about the missing money. Satterfield assured him that the cash was “safe” and “still on city property” and promised he would take the chief to see it the following day. As promised, the next afternoon Satterfield arrived at the chief’s office and told him the missing money was “All the way on the east end of town,” police reports say. He told the chief he moved the money because he was afraid that someone might tamper with evidence to “destroy his career.” Urbina pressed Satterfield — was there any other evidence missing?
“Satterfield emphatically responded, ‘No,’” according to a police report.
Urbina and Costa got in a car and followed Satterfield two miles to the city’s Fire Department Training Center. Satterfield put his car in park and opened the door to step out. He began walking “directly to one of the training containers” — a building that resembles a mobile home and can withstand flames to give firefighters accurate training scenarios — “on the west side of the property,” according to a police investigation. “Just as MPD Chief Urbina reached the entrance to the container, Satterfield emerged carrying what appeared to be a plastic bag containing what appeared to be an envelope. Satterfield handed the evidence bag over to MPD Chief Urbina. Satterfield stated that ‘more than a thousand (dollars)’ were in the evidence bag. When pressed about how many cases this money was from, Satterfield became flustered and could not provide a coherent response.”

 

Earlier this year, Satterfield was charged with embezzlement and tampering with evidence, both of which are felonies. He is awaiting trial. His attorney did not respond to a request for comment.
Satterfield is one of two law enforcement officers included on a “Brady List” by the Seventh Judicial District Attorney’s Office, which oversees prosecution for Socorro, Torrance, Sierra and Catron counties. The lists are named after two U.S. Supreme Court cases — Brady v. Maryland (1963) and Giglio v. U.S. (1972) — that directed prosecutors to disclose any material that could prove to be exculpatory to the defense or that could cast doubt on the credibility of the prosecution’s witnesses. These lists are maintained internally by prosecutors’ offices across the nation and serve as guideposts for which police officers, sheriff’s deputies and state troopers are suspected to have credibility problems and, therefore, could tank a case if prosecutors rely too heavily on their testimony.

 In the files pertaining to Satterfield’s case, deputies with the Torrance County Sheriff’s Office included an aerial photograph of the firefighter training facility where he allegedly stashed cash from his department’s evidence room. (Courtesy of Torrance County Sheriff’s Office)
Searchlight New Mexico requested copies of these lists, as well as supporting “Giglio disclosures” that explain why a DA’s office sometimes decides to question a given cop’s credibility, from each of the 14 DA’s offices in the state. Nine, including those that cover the state’s most populous areas in Albuquerque, Las Cruces and Santa Fe, responded in full. Two said they did not have any responsive records. Three did not respond.
There is seemingly no single, standardized format for tabulating and storing these records in New Mexico. Custodians in each of these offices keep these documents in different ways. In some district attorney’s offices, the internal documents clearly spell out which cops they do not want to call on for testimony — and why. In others, officers are listed as “potential” concerns that should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In yet others, prosecutors maintain folders of documents that include correspondence with an officer’s or deputy’s supervisors, who review an officer’s personnel file and then inform the local prosecutors of any red flags contained therein.
For instance, the DA in Bernalillo County — which publishes the names of Brady List officers on its public website — gave Searchlight supporting documentation such as emails and correspondence that shed light on internal investigations into several officers’ conduct. The Third Judicial District Attorney’s Office provided Searchlight with a two-page document titled, “Potential Giglio Officers,” with officers’ employers and brief notes from prosecutors as to why each one may be a risk to put on the stand.
Other offices did not give Searchlight a list. The Seventh Judicial District Attorney’s Office did not provide any internal memos or correspondence that shed light on how prosecutors view the reported conduct of these officers. It did, however, provide police reports, court documents and other information that explain why they are on the office’s Brady list.
In response to Searchlight’s request, the 12th Judicial District Attorney’s Office shared a spreadsheet with the names of each officer on its Brady List, as well as one line to explain their inclusion. The spreadsheet did not readily identify which law enforcement agency each officer and deputy works or worked for. Through reviews of court records and news reports, Searchlight has been able to identify many of them.
Searchlight has used these documents to identify nearly 100 current and former sworn police officers and sheriff’s deputies who have been deemed as a cause for concern by prosecuting attorneys. That figure is likely an undercount as several DA’s offices in the state did not provide any documents. In some cases, internal memos show, a given officer’s testimony could cast serious doubt on the prosecution’s case because of their discipline history. In others, prosecutors call officers a “potential” cause for concern but stop short of calling them altogether untrustworthy.
The law enforcement officers whose conduct has been called into question range from Las Cruces to Santa Fe, from Hobbs to Socorro. They face allegations ranging from embezzlement and tampering with evidence to domestic violence and child pornography. Many have been terminated, reprimanded or, in extreme cases, sentenced to prison. Others have left for jobs with new departments. Roswell Police Chief Lance Bateman, for instance, told Searchlight that none of the Roswell Police Department officers identified on the list still work for the city.
Below, see, in their own words, how local prosecutors and leaders in police departments and sheriff’s offices across the state refer to these law enforcement agents and their conduct. An officer’s listed department reflects where they worked at the time of inclusion on a local DA’s list. Many of their comments are presented in their entirety — edits were made only for length.

(Photo courtesy NReal Media Strategies)One advocacy group is jumping into Nevada’s 2026 endorsement cycle early with the hope of reversing the battleground state’s recent swing toward electing candidates with weaker records on protecting reproductive rights.
Abortion was seen as a key issue in the 2022 midterm elections, which took place months after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v Wade and largely brought wins for Democrats. Many expected the issue to be a deciding factor for voters in 2024, but Donald Trump’s ascent into a second presidential term, and Republicans taking control of both the House and Senate, raised doubts about that narrative.
“We learned the hard way in 2024,” said Reproductive Freedom for All President and CEO Mini Timmaraju, in an interview with the Nevada Current, conceding there were voters they took for granted.
Reproductive Freedom for All exit polls and focus groups held in the aftermath of last year’s election found that many voters simply did not believe Trump would actually attempt to ban or restrict abortion. Democrats in the lead up to the election had flagged this “Trump believability gap” as a problem on myriad issues.
Their research also found that Trump did better among voters who were not familiar with his positions on abortion.
“When Trump said he was going to ‘leave it to the states,’ it gave a permission structure for voters who were conflicted,” Timmaraju said.
She added, “I will give him and his campaign credit for successfully inoculating Democrats at the presidential level by continually showing message discipline.”
Voters could feel empowered to vote for Trump while also supporting abortion rights protections, like those proposed in Nevada’s Question 6, because they saw abortion as something out of the purview of a president, or as protected at the state level, or as something Congress would never rally the votes for.
Timmaraju sees it as voters being swayed by misinformation because the actions taken by the Trump administration since he took office should make it clear that the issue isn’t being left to the states. But voters need to hear the message.
“We have to get in front of them, and we have to know our candidate early, and get them to understand the policy landscape,” she said. “They’re with us, but that takes a lot of repetition. That means it takes a lot more time, more than ever before, more than it did even two years ago, to break through to voters.”
Gov. Joe Lombardo, like many Republican candidates in Nevada, struggled with the issue of abortion rights while on the campaign trail in 2022, giving conflicting messages and defaulting to a position of sidestepping the issue by calling abortion rights “settled” in the state.
It’s an argument Timmaraju thinks voters should reject next year when he is up for reelection.
“I don’t know Joe Lombardo well enough to understand what the hell he’s thinking,” she said. “You could think he’s moderate. It does not matter anymore. Anyone who is a Republican right now is complicit and cannot be trusted on fundamental freedoms like reproductive freedom.”
The GOP is in a “continual downward slide” into extremism, she added.

 


				Candidate filing doesn’t begin until March but Democrats Aaron Ford and Nicole Cannizzaro are among the candidates who have already publicly declared their intent to run for an office. Ford, currently attorney general, is running for governor. Cannizzaro, currently senate majority leader, is running for attorney general.
Both are currently expected to have Democratic primaries to contend with. Washoe County Commissioner Alexis Hill has announced her intent to run for governor, and Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine is actively campaigning for attorney general.
Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, has said he will run for re-election. Douglas County Commissioner Danny Tarkanian, a Republican, has announced he will run for attorney general.			




Reproductive Freedom for All on Friday announced candidate endorsements for Democrats Nicole Cannizzaro, who is running for attorney general, and Aaron Ford, who is running for governor.
It’s the first of a string of endorsements the organization plans to make in battleground states for the 2026 elections.
Cannizzaro, who the Current interviewed alongside Timmaraju last week, said reproductive rights won’t be stripped away from people through “one sweeping piece of legislation that says, ‘here’s a bill to take away all of your rights.’”
“They happen with the incremental policy changes that do affect people,” she said. “There are many ways to attack access, and we are watching that happen right before our eyes.”
Added Timmaraju, “The Trump administration has shown absolutely no limits on how they will mess with states and their administration of federal programs.”
Telemedicine, which is filling voids where physical reproductive health clinics have been forced to close, is one target. The prescription drugs used in medical abortions have been another target.
“Abortion is legal in this state but if the Trump administration managed to circumvent access to medicinal abortion through a number of ways, there’s no protection for Nevadans, even if you codified it in your constitution. They are being nefarious,” said Timmaraju.
Attorney general races play a major role in combatting attempts to strip protections away, she added.
“Every state where we’ve passed a ballot measure but don’t have an AG on our side, we’ve had problems,” she said. “In the states where we’ve passed (ballot measures), and we have an AG who’s willing to enforce, is where we’ve actually seen the realization of the promise of the measure.”
The state of reproductive rights in Nevada
In 2024, Nevadans overwhelmingly supported Question 6, a proposal to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. The measure must pass again on the 2026 general election ballot to go into effect.
If passed, abortion rights would be further strengthened in the state. Abortion already has some strong protections, primarily through a law passed as a ballot measure in the 1990s. Changing that law requires a vote of the people.
In December, Nevada Medicaid expanded its coverage of abortion services, the result of a lawsuit filed by the ACLU of Nevada. That lawsuit argued that the existing policy violated the state’s Equal Rights Amendment, which voters passed in 2022.
But not everything has trended toward expanded access.
Earlier this year, Nevada’s 1985 parental notification law, which requires that minors notify their parents or guardian before having an abortion, went into effect for the first time. A decades-long injunction had kept the law from being enforced.
After that decision, Planned Parenthood Mar Monte announced it would fight the ruling in court but their efforts were thwarted in federal court. A separate state challenge is still pending.
Cannizzaro criticized the parental notification law, saying the years she spent as a Clark County prosecutor influenced her perspective.
“People do not like to think about the fact that there are children who are living in homes where they’re being sexually abused, and oftentimes their rapist is a family member, so it’s not safe for that child to ask for parental notification in order to not have to birth their rapist’s baby,” she said. “That is a very real thing that happens.”
The parental notification law now being enforced lacks protections for those children, she continued, and puts them at greater risk.
When asked if there had ever been conversations in the Legislature about addressing the 1985 law, Cannizzaro said there hadn’t been.
“Because there was an injunction in place for so long, there were other things that we were looking at,” she said. “The statutes that were actually on the books and in effect and not affected by any sort of injunction.”
Among those priorities was 2019’s Trust Nevada Women Act, which decriminalized medicated abortion and removed antiquated informed consent laws, such as a mandate that physicians tell patients about the emotional impact of an abortion.
Cannizzaro recalls the criticism at the time: “Why do you have to take outdated penalties out of state law? This is not an issue. This hasn’t been an issue. It’s not an issue.”
But attempts by the Trump administration to use century-old laws to restrict the prescription drugs used in medicinal abortion shows that antiquated laws can be a source of ammo for legislators or administrations looking to restrict access.
A focus on IVF
In the 2025 Legislative Session, Cannizzaro sponsored a “right to assisted reproduction treatment” bill, which would have required many private and public insurance companies to cover procedures like in-vitro fertilization. Lombardo vetoed it.
Cannizzaro said the governor’s office gave her no indication that he was considering vetoing the IVF bill, which received some bipartisan support, or any of the 87 bills he vetoed. This despite her office asking for feedback on the IVF bill and dozens of others prior to their final passage by the Legislature.
“We brought this to the governor’s office many times. ‘Hey, can you take a look at these bills? Hey, can you let us know where you’re at? Hey, can you let us know?’”
The IVF bill concerns raised in Lombardo’s veto letter could have been answered by watching the bill hearing, said Cannizzaro, or by having a conversation with her.
The veto letter cited, among other things, the potential cost to Nevada Medicaid. That provision, Cannizzaro said, was scheduled to go into effect in a future biennium, and Medicaid staff had indicated they would apply for an available waiver allowing the federal government to cover some of the cost.
Cannizzaro said she is committed, whether still in the Nevada State Senate or as attorney general, to making sure IVF returns “front and center” in the next regular legislative session.
Members of the caucus are “ready to take up that mantle,” she said, “because there’s no way that bill should have been vetoed.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/P1000776-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-02 07:56:20.956513

(Photo by Ryan Berry/Washington State Standard)Washington Attorney General Nick Brown and dozens of his colleagues across the country are calling on tech companies and payment platforms to take action to block computer-generated pornography. 
Two letters the bipartisan group of attorneys general sent last month note 98% of fake videos posted online specifically feature so-called deepfake pornography. Almost all target women and girls. Altogether, these videos have received hundreds of millions of views.
This year, the Washington Legislature overwhelmingly approved making the willful distribution of a forged digital likeness, or deepfake, a gross misdemeanor crime. Experts say the law is the first in the nation to impose criminal liability for any malicious deepfake, not just those that are sexual or political. It went into effect late last month.
In recent years, lawmakers have also created a civil cause of action for political candidates depicted in manipulated content that isn’t disclosed as fabricated, and prohibited digitally-altered sexual photographs or videos of children and sharing any fake intimate images.
State AI regulations were at risk earlier this summer when Congress considered banning the rules in its massive tax cut and spending bill. U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington, led the push to remove that provision from the sprawling legislation.
At the federal level, President Donald Trump in May signed a new law criminalizing the distribution of revenge pornography, including artificial intelligence-generated deepfakes. The bipartisan law, called the Take It Down Act, requires platforms to allow victims of this type of sexual abuse to request their picture or video be taken down within 48 hours.
One of the letters penned last month asks Visa, Mastercard, American Express, PayPal, Google Pay and Apple Pay to enforce policies prohibiting their services from being used to profit from the disturbing content. In 2020, for example, Visa and Mastercard announced they’d stop processing payments on Pornhub due to videos depicting sexual assault.
Brown and the other attorneys general want similar action on deepfake pornography, arguing that sellers of tools used to make these videos accept money from these credit card companies and payment processors.
“Payment platforms should not only deny sellers the ability to use their services when they are on notice of these connections but should be actively working to identify and remove any such sellers from their network,” the letter reads.

One generative AI company, Civitai, has had to turn to cryptocurrency this year after its payment processor pulled out over concerns about nonconsensual computer-generated content.
A second letter, to the search engine arms of Google, Microsoft and Yahoo, lists two requests.
First, the attorneys general ask the companies to describe how they’re already working to restrict access to deepfake pornography. And second, they ask for a commitment to further action “to avoid being complicit” in the proliferation of such content.
They liken this issue to how search engines respond when users look up how to build a bomb. Instead of a guide, the users get government resources and scientific articles. When someone searches for how to die by suicide, they get prevention options.

(Photo courtesy of the Oregon Department of Transportation)A bill to fund road maintenance and stave off hundreds of layoffs at the Oregon Department of Transportation narrowly cleared the Oregon House on Monday, more than two months after a prior attempt fizzled on the final night of the regular legislative session.
A 36-12 Labor Day vote on mostly party lines, reached after Democrats who control all branches of government agreed to make temporary a payroll tax increase to fund public transit, is the first major step to passing a 10-year, $4.3 billion package of tax and fee increases. The proposal still needs a vote from the Oregon Senate, anticipated on Wednesday.
It’s less than one-third the size of an ambitious earlier proposal, and even supporters characterized it as only a temporary fix meant to keep roads plowed, potholes filled and buses running.
“This bill keeps the lights on, but it doesn’t light the path forward,” said Rep. Mark Gamba, D-Milwaukie.



What fees and taxes would change under the proposed transportation package?
A gas tax increase from $0.40 to $0.46, effective Jan. 1, 2026, is expected to raise $90 million a year. The gas tax is split among the state and local governments, with half of the tax for the state, 30% for counties and 20% for cities.
An increase in annual registration fees from $43 to $85 for passenger vehicles; $63 to $105 for utility vehicles, light trailers, low-speed vehicles and medium-speed electric vehicles; and $44 to $86 for mopeds and motorcycles.
Increasing title fees for passenger vehicles from $77 to $216.
Temporarily doubling the payroll tax used to support public transit from 0.1% to 0.2% from Jan 1., 2026 to Jan. 1, 2028.
An increase to registration surcharges for electric and highly fuel-efficient vehicles, from $35 to $65 annually for cars with a 40+ miles-per-gallon rating, and from $115 to $145 annually for electric vehicles.



Phasing in a mandatory road usage charge program for electric vehicles by 2031. Electric vehicle drivers have been able to opt into the OReGO program and pay 2 cents per mile in exchange for lower registration fees, and the proposed change would mandate electric vehicle drivers participate in that program or pay a flat $340 annual fee.
Rep. Susan McLain, D-Forest Grove, and the House’s main architect of the earlier failed transportation package, said the latest proposal is a “pragmatic budget” that will help preserve roads and bridges that every Oregonian needs.
“We have heard from city councils and county commissions from every corner of Oregon, urban and liberal, north and south, east and west, red and blue, that this additional funding is absolutely a lifeline for their communities and their citizens,” McLain said.
Any tax increases require 36 votes to pass in the House, and the vote went on mostly party lines. But Rep. Cyrus Javadi, R-Tillamook, joined Democrats voting for the measure, while Rep. Annessa Hartman, D-Gladstone, joined Republicans in opposing it.
Javadi said he understood why Oregonians — including some “energetic” social media commenters whose sentiments he couldn’t repeat without violating House decorum rules — don’t want to raise the gas tax, or any tax.
“I received a lot of phone calls, sometimes at 10 o’clock at night, from people I have never met in my life, asking me to vote ‘no’ and threatening me I will lose my job if I dare vote ‘yes,’” Javadi said. “And to them, I might say, I think my job is worth it if compared to the hundreds more it will save across the state.”
Javadi, who represents a coastal district where landslides too often close stretches of Highway 101, or drivers crash on narrow, curving roads, said Oregonians need safe, open roads. Without passing the bill, he said, his constituents could be stranded by highway closures or unplowed snow or lose their lives because of stalled response from emergency services.
“The cost of doing nothing is far greater than the cost of doing something,” Javadi said. “We can pay a little more now at the pump, or we can pay a lot later in lost wages and lost opportunities.”
Hartman, meanwhile, said she still clearly remembers the days when she would choose to risk not renewing her vehicle registration to have the money to pay for groceries, and many of the working families in her district face similar choices.
“Those families in my district deserve my voice in this moment,” Hartman said.
House Republican Leader Christine Drazan, R-Canby, sat behind two piles of paper. Republicans described one, nearly 2 feet tall, as consisting of printed copies of more than 4,300 pieces of written testimony from Oregonians who opposed the bill. The other, much shorter, pile had copies of written comments from supporters.
In all, 94% of commenters opposed the transportation proposal, Drazan said. She read several of the comments, saying voices of those Oregonians should be heard.
“I could go on and on and on with the voices of Oregonians who are asking for this body to hear them,” Drazan said.
Rep. E. Werner Reschke, R-Malin, said it wasn’t the right time to raise taxes, especially given a recent revenue forecast that shows the state’s surplus turning into a deficit.
“We’re going to attempt to solve one problem but then create one that is far, far worse.”
But Rep. Paul Evans, D-Monmouth, said there was no time to wait.
“Right now, ODOT has a sucking chest wound,” Evans said. “We can all sit around and watch the patient die; we can debate life choices and whether or not they should have done this or that. But the fact of the matter is, weather is coming, and our families and our cities and our state need folks out there.”

(Provided/Savannah Smith and Garland Wilson)COLUMBIA — The night before South Carolina’s annual beekeeping conference and competition, high school students Savannah Smith and Garland Wilson sat in a hotel bathroom, picking bubbles out of jars of honey.
Smith, a senior, and Wilson, a junior, harvested the honey as part of the Governor’s School for Agriculture’s beekeeping club, using equipment donated to bolster the fledgling program. The two needed their jars to be perfectly pristine for the next day’s competition, where they would be two of the youngest people competing.
Panic set in when condensation from a shower caused the jars to fog up, and again when bubbles reappeared. The students rushed to wipe off all the watermarks and put the jars in a car overnight, hoping the bubbles would disappear.
“We went out the next day, and they were beautiful,” Smith said. “And then we got first (place).”
5 years after reopening with a new mission, SC agriculture school is beyond capacity

The students’ success at the July competition in Columbia, where they won half a dozen awards, shows the success of the year-old program, said instructor Susan Jones, an apiculture specialist who competed alongside her students.
“Getting these girls to the state conference was kind of a test case,” Jones said. “I really did not expect them to win. We were going as a learning experience. And the fact that they did so well is just very satisfying.”
In its second year, the program is set to expand.
Duke Energy donated $25,000 for state-of-the-art honey harvesting equipment and a honey house, which gives students a dedicated space to filter and jar their honey.
With 19 hives of honeybees, students will start making and selling their own beeswax products while continuing to make award-winning honey, Jones said.
Like with all courses at the agricultural school, known for centuries as John de la Howe, the goal is for students to recognize beekeeping as a viable career path, Jones said.
Smith and Wilson are already on their way to achieving intermediate certification, one step down from the master certification that separates hobby and commercial beekeepers, they said.
Beekeeping is an essential career not just to produce honey but to help farmers’ crops grow, Duke Energy spokesman Ryan Mosier said in an email. The donation came from the utility’s foundation, which focuses in part on climate resiliency, he said.
“Agribusiness is a top industry in South Carolina going back to the state’s beginnings, and this school is educating the next generation of those business leaders,” Mosier said.
Getting started
Neither Smith nor Wilson had any particular affinity for bees when they elected to start their own hives.
“I just heard it, and I was like, ‘I like outside. Bees are outside. Bees are good, apparently.’ So, I signed up,” Wilson said.
After a year of helping tend six hives, both earned their beginners’ certifications. At least once a week, they go out to their hives to check on the bees, making sure they show no signs of pests or diseases, Jones said.

The program got off to a rough start. Jones tried to start the program in 2021, after giving several guest lectures on beekeeping.
The school’s teachers had too much on their plates to properly instruct the students on how to care for the hives, and the school couldn’t find any volunteers in rural McCormick, so none of the bees survived over the winter.
Jones, a former president of the South Carolina Beekeepers Association, tried again in 2024, after coming onto the staff as an instructor. After a successful first year, the school’s aviary expanded to 19 hives this school year.
Each hive can produce between four and nine gallons of honey, Jones said.
“When you start doing that math, that’s going to be a lot of honey for this next year,” she said.
The program isn’t all about honey, though. Honey is a great byproduct, but the real value comes from teaching students about pollination. The students also look after bumblebees, which don’t produce honey, at the campus’ greenhouse.
“If you want something from the bees, it’s one thing,” Smith said. Non-native honey bees are the best at making honey and other byproducts, “but if you’re talking about, ‘Save the bees,’ let’s talk native bees.”
After normal classes finished every day, Smith and Wilson joined several classmates in walking out to a classroom in the woods with their notebooks and pencils. There, Jones lectured for about two hours at a time.
The knowledge shows. Smith and Wilson know about the origins of different bees, how they pollinate and how that affects the environment.
Both are certified beekeeping apprentices, and both are on their way to moving up to the intermediary level, which is a rare feat for teenagers, Jones said.
Award-winning honey
Already, the students have a strong foundation, Jones said. That much was clear when Smith and Wilson took home first-place prizes at the South Carolina Beekeepers Association conference in July.

Wilson walked away with first-place ribbons in novice honey and dark honey, as well as a third-place accolade for photography. Smith scored runner-up in novice honey, first place in amber honey and fifth place in black jar, which judges decide based on taste alone.
The awards are based not on a ranking system but on whether the honey meets a certain standard, Jones said.
A category could have multiple first-place winners or none at all. In this case, scoring first place meant the students made the honey as good as it could be, she said.
At nearly every turn, Smith and Wilson were the youngest people in the room.
“Everyone was like, ‘Oh my goodness,’ and they’d never seen us before, so they were like, ‘Where did they come from?’” Smith said.
This year, the students feel good about their odds.
Different parts of campus produce different tastes and colors of honey, since the bees pollinate different flowers and trees. Smith, in particular, plans to graduate with a big win. She has a hive in the woods that she thinks is making “the most natural honey under the sun,” she said.
With the donated equipment, the students can collect beeswax as well, which they can turn into any number of items, which Jones calls “lotions and potions.” Students will be able to submit candles, soap or lip balm for consideration at next year’s conference.
Next up is the South Carolina State Fair in October. The students plan to clean up any problems they had at the conference over the summer to perfect their jars of honey.

(Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)The divide among Democrats this year is as much attitudinal as it is ideological. 
Rank-and-file Democrats are thirsting for leaders who will fight rather than fold in the face of the Trump administration’s unprecedented power grabs. 
Annie Wells, whose crop art recreation of Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan’s Senate campaign poster hung in the State Fair Agriculture Horticulture building, doesn’t want a candidate who tries to meet Republicans in the middle.
“She’s one of the Democrats that’s actually trying to stand up and do things,” Wells said. “I’m frustrated with a lot of the Democrats that are not being bold enough in response to what’s happening at the federal level.”
If there’s one thing Flanagan’s campaign wants Democratic voters to know, it’s which side of the fight/fold divide she’s on. 
“Peggy is the most dedicated fighter for kids in America, y’all,” Attorney General Keith Ellison said at a packed rally in Minneapolis Friday night. 
“I’m here to fight for a woman who has the courage to fight for all of us,” said U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.
Democrats across the country continue to grapple with what went wrong in 2024 — when Flanagan’s governing partner, Gov. Tim Walz, was on the national ticket — and how to win voters back in 2026.

For Flanagan, it starts with a fighting stance. 
“I know resiliency, and survival, and fight, and overcoming challenges and any obstacle that people put in our way,” she said.
Flanagan’s opponent in the Democratic primary is U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, a moderate who has represented the south metro in Congress since 2019. As Flanagan courts the party’s progressive grassroots, Craig has long appealed to centrist suburban and rural voters, emphasizing her record supporting law enforcement, border security, agriculture and collaboration across the aisle.
After years spent cultivating that political persona, Craig has pumped up her anti-Trump rhetoric since launching her first statewide campaign. In an April video announcing her Senate run, Craig called out Trump for the “chaos and corruption coming out of Washington, crashing down on all of us, every day,” and “a president trampling our rights and freedoms, as he profits for personal gain.”
Still, listen to how Flanagan recently framed her campaign against Craig — in classic Midwestern style, without naming or directly attacking Craig — in front of more than 1,000 supporters at at a brewery in northeast Minneapolis: “Will we send Washington the same old people and the same old solutions — or will we be bolder and fight harder and get more done for people?” 
A ‘lived experience’ candidate
Flanagan is an enrolled member of the White Earth Nation and the daughter of Anishinaabe activist Marvin Manypenny, a fierce advocate for tribal sovereignty. If elected, she will be the first Native woman elected to the U.S. Senate.
She was raised by her mother in St. Louis Park, where they relied on public assistance to survive. In speeches, Flanagan tells stories of walking home from the food shelf, cradling government surplus cheese under her arm like a football; holding a different-colored lunch ticket to indicate that she qualified for free or reduced-cost lunch; relying on Medicaid for health care and Section 8 vouchers for housing.
“If we had more people serving in the U.S. Senate who relied on SNAP for nutrition and who relied on Medicaid for their health care, we probably wouldn’t have passed this big, ugly bill,” Flanagan said, referring to the GOP mega-law Trump signed on July 4.

After working on the late Sen. Paul Wellstone’s campaign in 2002, Flanagan won her first election in 2004, when she became the Minneapolis School Board’s youngest member at age 25. 
She became the director of the Native American Leadership Program at Wellstone Action, an academy started by the Wellstone family after the senator’s death. The organization trained influential Minnesota Democrats including Walz and Ellison. 
Flanagan met Walz at a three-day “Camp Wellstone” and knocked doors for his first campaign in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District. (Walz won that race and the following five.)
As executive director of the Children’s Defense Fund of Minnesota, she co-chaired a coalition pushing to raise Minnesota’s minimum wage. The coalition scored a major win in 2014 when the DFL-controlled Legislature raised the minimum wage to $9.50 by 2016, and adjusted for inflation after.
Flanagan won a seat in the state House in 2015, representing the west metro district that includes her hometown of St. Louis Park. 
Walz selected Flanagan as his running mate in 2017. She was an olive branch to the left wing of the DFL and a counterweight to Walz’s perceived centrist leanings — he’d represented a purple (now red) district in Congress for more than a decade and had an A rating from the NRA.
Walz and Flanagan both claim credit to the slate of DFL priorities passed in the 2023 legislative session: paid family and medical leave, free school meals, and universal background checks for gun purchases, among others. 
The almost-governor
The day Vice President Kamala Harris selected Walz to join her on the Democratic ticket for the highest executive offices in the nation, Flanagan’s life changed, too.
This time last year, Flanagan was sampling the new State Fair foods with chef Andrew Zimmern and serving all-you-can-drink milk.
Behind the scenes, she was preparing to ascend to the governor’s office, meeting with donors and prospective staffers. In public, she campaigned for Walz and Harris at 77 stops in 90 days. She stepped into the national spotlight as the successor to Walz, pending his and Harris’ victory; Politico profiled her, and top party leaders asked her to speak on day one of the 2024 Democratic National Convention.
But when Harris and Walz lost, Flanagan’s shortcut to the governor’s office abruptly closed.

Walz returned to Minnesota and stepped back from public life for a couple of months. Flanagan, for her part, returned to the stream of appearances that define the public role of lieutenant governor: packing meals at food shelves; gaveling in the state Senate; meeting with the Future Farmers of America and small business owners and social workers and labor unions and community college students.
After nearly a decade joined at the hip, Walz and Flanagan stopped appearing together in public. Flanagan wasn’t in attendance at Walz’s homecoming speech or routine events she had attended in the past. 
Walz administration officials, granted anonymity by the Star Tribune, said in December that Walz wasn’t happy with the steps Flanagan took to prepare for governorship, including planning for a potential run in 2026 and tapping into Walz’s campaign funds without authorization for some campaign work. (Walz publicly downplayed the division and praised Flanagan; Flanagan never commented publicly on the rift, and says she’ll support Walz with his next steps.)
And then, in February, U.S. Sen. Tina Smith announced she won’t seek re-election in 2026, creating an opportunity for Flanagan to set out on her own.
Flanagan’s role in the frenzied 2024 campaign was to support Walz and Harris; but it also formed the foundation for a future statewide run.
“I do think it was an opportunity for me to get to know more Minnesotans to get to know folks nationwide,” Flanagan told the Reformer. 
Walz has not yet announced whether he will run for a third term. Flanagan’s Senate bid means he would have to find a new running mate.

Despite the political separation from Walz, Flanagan will be forced to defend their shared record and — not unlike Harris with Joe Biden — decide when to publicly break from the administration she has served. From flagging school test scores to a looming budget deficit, fraud in public programs to population stagnation, Republicans — and Craig, depending on how she wants to run her campaign — will have fodder.  
Eschewing corporate money
Standing in the way of Flanagan’s aspirations are a primary election, a general election and a president with a firm grasp on Congress and the courts.
Trump and Republicans have “ransacked our government” and are “spitting in the faces of millions of people” who stand to lose health care or food assistance, Flanagan said at the recent rally with Warren.
Flanagan also lobbed attacks at corporations and big-money politics. 
Voters need to elect people who “have the guts to fight against these powerful corporate interests who are pulling the strings these days,” Flanagan said. 
Flanagan has promised not to accept donations from corporate political action committees. 
By the end of June, she had raised nearly $1.4 million, with most of the money coming from individual donations of $200 or less.
Many of the largest donations — most in the amount of $3,500 — were from tribal nations from around the country. 
Standing on a platform surrounded by Democratic-Farmer-Labor voters at the party’s state fair tent, Flanagan introduced herself in Ojibwe, as she does in most public appearances. Then she switched to English:

DemasAs Michigan Lawmakers work to court data centers through tax incentives, Consumers Energy, one of the state’s largest energy providers, is seeking to tweak its rate requirements for businesses using large amounts of energy over time, citing increasing requests for service from these types of facilities. 
Earlier this year, Consumers sent an application to the Michigan Public Service Commission proposing several provisions to protect ratepayers from facing increased costs as a result of the heavy energy demand brought by data centers. 
Among those proposals are a 15-year minimum contract term, minimum billing and an exit fee requirement. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Without the Company’s proposed protections, other customers would pay for the incremental costs to serve a data center or other large load customer if that customer exits service before sufficient revenue is generated to offset costs,” Consumers wrote in its brief to the Public Service Commission.
While the company has modified its proposal to consider feedback from several stakeholders, members of the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Environmental Law and Policy Center and Vote Solar argue Consumers could go further. 
In addition to focusing on financial and contract terms, the three groups said Consumers’ plan should further consider the increased demand for energy these data centers will bring, and how clean energy resources factor into its plan to bring on new energy generation to meet that need. 
“Consumers Energy’s proposal fails to fully recognize the paradigm shift that new data center loads represent, and their initial brief only engages a narrow subset of the concerns raised. A clear directive from the Commission is critical to ensure a proactive approach to new data centers that supports an affordable, clean energy future for Michigan,” Lee Shaver, a senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists said in a statement.

In a brief of their own, the groups offered several recommendations they say would better protect ratepayers and support Michigan’s transition to clean energy. 
Those recommendations include requiring large load customers to provide a clean energy sourcing plan as part of the process of connecting to the grid alongside regular reporting on clean energy and usage; ensuring these customers have access to voluntary green pricing, which allows customers to specify that a specific amount of their power comes from renewable energy sources; and establishing a data center specific rate to keep costs from shifting to other customers. 
“Many tech companies building data centers in Consumers Energy’s territory have ambitious clean energy goals. With the right incentives and guardrails, they could help advance the region’s clean energy transition. This case gives the MPSC its best chance to act now and avoid falling behind. If it waits, Consumers risks triggering rushed clean energy procurements, higher costs and greater risks for customers,” Saad Siddique, an economist and analyst with the Environmental Law and Policy Center said in a statement. 
Members of the Michigan Environmental Council, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, and Citizens Utility Board of Michigan also asked the Public Service Commission to ensure Consumer’s modified rate structure complies with Michigan’s requirement that energy companies provide electricity from 100% clean energy sources by 2040.

They also argued that service agreements between Consumers Energy and data center customers should include a plan for meeting the benchmarks building up to the 100% clean energy standard, through a combination of resources supplied by the data center, long-term contracts for renewable resources and/or participation in voluntary green pricing.
In an email, Consumers Energy Media Relations Specialist Brian Wheeler said the proposed changes for large load customers does not address or change its future electric supply plans. 
“Consumers Energy continues to follow our long-term energy supply plan to both serve new data centers and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.

(Courtesy photo)Much of the discussion surrounding property tax reform has focused on schools, law enforcement and local government having to cut services due to reduced funding. But libraries are also in line to see impacts from Senate Enrolled Act 1 – legislation passed in April cutting property taxes.
Several Indiana librarians expressed uncertainty about the exact effects of SEA 1, a complicated law that impacts both property and income taxes. 
“I wish I knew exactly what all this was going to mean,” said Kim Porter, director of the Batesville Memorial Public Library. “I don’t understand it.”
Two major concerns raised by SEA 1, according to Indiana Library Federation President Julie Wendorf are property tax revenue and the local income tax (LIT) distribution formula. Hoosier homeowners are expected to save an average of $300 in property taxes – the primary funding source for most libraries, according to Wendorf. Paired with changes to LIT formulas, many library’s budgets will feel the strain. 
“Library funding across Indiana is not standardized,” Wendorf explained, “each public library receives tax support in a unique manner, influenced by its local property tax rate and access to local income tax revenue.”  
The full effects of SEA 1 likely won’t be seen until 2028, by which point many will face “significant reductions to their overall funding,” said Wendorf, “due to both diminished property tax growth and decreased LIT allocations.”
Libraries can’t raise local income taxes on their own and instead will have to petition counties to approve a LIT dollars for their use. 










Sure, the library is an old-fashioned concept. So is democracy, so is equal opportunity, so is knowledge.


– Carri Randall, Johnson County library patron


Beyond her role with the library federation, Wendorf serves as the director of Crown Point Community Library. 
“As local governments prepare their 2026 budgets, we’re trying to account for the impact of SEA 1 without having much concrete data,” she shared. Crown Point’s library has implemented a hiring freeze for new positions and is reviewing staff vacancies individually. When a department head recently announced their retirement, Wendorf said, “I merged two departments to achieve significant savings.” 
While working on next year’s budget, Wendorf explained that she’s reviewing contracts and expenses, cutting costs where possible to “help offset the first year’s impact.”  Offsetting that impact, however, is challenging “because SEA 1 limits revenue growth,” meaning “the gap between funding and rising expenses will only widen over time.”
Coupled with what Wendorf describes as “cascading funding pressures,” Indiana’s local, state and even federal libraries will see their ability to provide services hindered. One notable example — following the dismantling of the Institute of Museum and Library Services in March, the Indiana State Library lost $3 million in federal funding. That $3 million directly supported Indiana’s public libraries. 
The state library’s budget was also further cut by state lawmakers, which impacts what it can provide local libraries. Areas affected by these cuts and SEA 1 include public internet access — many libraries rely on the state library’s Internet Connectivity Grant, which partially reimburses local libraries for service costs to provide public internet access — and the INSPIRE database, an education and research tool used by public, academic and school libraries. Funding cuts may force public libraries to secure their own database subscriptions at a high cost to maintain the same level of access.
“Smaller or rural libraries with limited reserves could be forced into structural deficits, staff cuts or service closures,” Wendorf said, “as a result, public access to literacy and lifelong learning resources, digital equity and community program could be curtailed at a time when Hoosiers continue to rely heavily on libraries for these services.”
Vanessa Martin, director of the Greensburg Decatur County Public Library, elaborated on where rural libraries, especially, may need to make cuts. 
“I think a lot of libraries are looking at their electronic offerings,” Martin said, “So, Overdrive, Libby, Hoopla,” she named three widely used ebook and streaming services libraries use, “any databases that aren’t getting used as much. Those aren’t things that we necessarily want to completely cut out,” she emphasized, noting use of many databases has increased, “but we might have to limit more.” 
She added that regarding programming, libraries “might have to do more with less” and potentially explore staffing cuts. The key, she said, is to find “a good balance of where the money goes to fund all the different things that we do.”
“People are still using the library,” Martin said, “we have people in here every day – for things that go beyond the books.” 
Martin noted that Greensburg’s library has people visiting daily for internet access, meeting spaces, tutoring and more, “we’re still needed,” she said, “our digital offerings numbers continue to go up.”

Porter, with the Batesville library, is in a particularly unique position as the city sits on the Ripley-Franklin County line. Both counties have additional library systems that will also need to be funded via LIT and property tax money.
“It could be interesting,” Porter observed, “I could get funds from one county and not from the other.” 
One-third of Batesville’s operating budget currently comes from local income tax dollars — “it’s just going to be really interesting, because I know it’s not going to cover everything that we do.”
Some library directors are already working to educate their communities on the potential impact of SEA 1.
Johnson County Public Library Director Lisa Lintner hosted two public meetings covering ‘Funding and the Future of JCPL’ — walking citizens through how the library is funded and how SEA 1 might affect the library’s future.
 “I am asking residents to volunteer to be advocates on our behalf,” Lintner said, “to support fully funding our library in the future, when we’ll need to begin petitioning the county in 2027 for continued funding of our local income taxes in 2028.” 
About 45 people attended the program, according to Lintner, who added that she plans to repeat the program every few months. “Attendees were grateful to understand more clearly how the library is funded,” she said, “many expressed concern for our future funding and wanted to learn how they could support us.”
The Johnson County library gets 40% of its operating budget from LIT money. 
With the passage of SEA 1, Lintner said, “we will have to begin petitioning our county council” for LIT funds in 2027. By 2028, “many library districts could see devastating outcomes if LIT funding is not approved,” she observed. 
The less-heralded provisions of property tax reform

More than 200 library districts across Indiana rely on LIT money, according to Lintner.
Kerri Gipson, a long-time Johnson County public library user, said “it breaks my heart to think of JCPL not getting necessary funding to continue providing the valuable resources and services that they currently provide. Libraries are such an asset to community.” 
The library became a big part of Gipson and her family’s lives in 2014, when Gipson started homeschooling her son following a move to Johnson County. Gipson and her son have both bonded with library staff over the past decade and they’ve both gotten involved in volunteer work — her son runs three weekly Dungeons and Dragons programs at JCPL and its branches and was named volunteer of the year in 2024. Gipson herself has done ESL tutoring and assists in her son’s programs.
“It means so much that JCPL creates safe, inclusive environments where everyone feels welcome and values,” she said.
Carri Randall has been a lifelong library user, dating back to her childhood in Los Angeles and volunteers at JCPL when possible. Randall, a teacher, shared that she and her colleagues “rely on libraries,” noting they make resources accessible to all that might not be otherwise.
“When I work with students on gathering information – there is no way it can be done solely within the confines of the school day. The only places they are going to be able to access any needed information for free is the public library,” especially kids from lower-income homes — three of Johnson County’s schools have free or reduced lunch rates of over 40%, according to Randall.Libraries are no longer just information vaults or the keepers of information, she said. As examples, Randall cited database access, ebooks, wifi hotspot access, programs for the public, interlibrary loans, access to out-of-print sources, story hour and many other valuable educational services.
She believes libraries provide all residents with access to resources “that will mean the difference between success and failure for residents as individuals, Johnson County as a community and the United States as a nation. Sure, the library is an old-fashioned concept. So is democracy, so is equal opportunity, so is knowledge.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Summer-Reading-kickoff-2025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-02 07:56:20.956513

Artificial intelligence systems are thirsty, consuming as much as 500 milliliters of water – a single-serving water bottle – for each short conversation a user has with the GPT-3 version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT system. They use roughly the same amount of water to draft a 100-word email message.
That figure includes the water used to cool the data center’s servers and the water consumed at the power plants generating the electricity to run them.
But the study that calculated those estimates also pointed out that AI systems’ water usage can vary widely, depending on where and when the computer answering the query is running.

To me, as an academic librarian and professor of education, understanding AI is not just about knowing how to write prompts. It also involves understanding the infrastructure, the trade-offs, and the civic choices that surround AI.
Many people assume AI is inherently harmful, especially given headlines calling out its vast energy and water footprint. Those effects are real, but they’re only part of the story.
When people move from seeing AI as simply a resource drain to understanding its actual footprint, where the effects come from, how they vary, and what can be done to reduce them, they are far better equipped to make choices that balance innovation with sustainability.
Two hidden streams
Behind every AI query are two streams of water use.
The first is on-site cooling of servers that generate enormous amounts of heat. This often uses evaporative cooling towers – giant misters that spray water over hot pipes or open basins. The evaporation carries away heat, but that water is removed from the local water supply, such as a river, a reservoir or an aquifer. Other cooling systems may use less water but more electricity.
The second stream is used by the power plants generating the electricity to power the data center. Coal, gas and nuclear plants use large volumes of water for steam cycles and cooling.
Hydropower also uses up significant amounts of water, which evaporates from reservoirs. Concentrated solar plants, which run more like traditional steam power stations, can be water-intensive if they rely on wet cooling.
By contrast, wind turbines and solar panels use almost no water once built, aside from occasional cleaning.
Climate and timing matter
Water use shifts dramatically with location. A data center in cool, humid Ireland can often rely on outside air or chillers and run for months with minimal water use. By contrast, a data center in Arizona in July may depend heavily on evaporative cooling. Hot, dry air makes that method highly effective, but it also consumes large volumes of water, since evaporation is the mechanism that removes heat.
Timing matters too. A University of Massachusetts Amherst study found that a data center might use only half as much water in winter as in summer. And at midday during a heat wave, cooling systems work overtime. At night, demand is lower.
Newer approaches offer promising alternatives. For instance, immersion cooling submerges servers in fluids that don’t conduct electricity, such as synthetic oils, reducing water evaporation almost entirely.
And a new design from Microsoft claims to use zero water for cooling, by circulating a special liquid through sealed pipes directly across computer chips. The liquid absorbs heat and then releases it through a closed-loop system without needing any evaporation. The data centers would still use some potable water for restrooms and other staff facilities, but cooling itself would no longer draw from local water supplies.
These solutions are not yet mainstream, however, mainly because of cost, maintenance complexity and the difficulty of converting existing data centers to new systems. Most operators rely on evaporative systems.
A simple skill you can use
The type of AI model being queried matters, too. That’s because of the different levels of complexity and the hardware and amount of processor power they require. Some models may use far more resources than others. For example, one study found that certain models can consume over 70 times more energy and water than ultra‑efficient ones.
You can estimate AI’s water footprint yourself in just three steps, with no advanced math required.
Step 1 – Look for credible research or official disclosures. Independent analyses estimate that a medium-length GPT-5 response, which is about 150 to 200 words of output, or roughly 200 to 300 tokens, uses about 19.3 watt-hours. A response of similar length from GPT-4o uses about 1.75 watt-hours.
Step 2 – Use a practical estimate for the amount of water per unit of electricity, combining the usage for cooling and for power.
Independent researchers and industry reports suggest that a reasonable range today is about 1.3 to 2.0 milliliters per watt-hour. The lower end reflects efficient facilities that use modern cooling and cleaner grids. The higher end represents more typical sites.
Step 3 – Now it’s time to put the pieces together. Take the energy number you found in Step 1 and multiply it by the water factor from Step 2. That gives you the water footprint of a single AI response.
Here’s the one-line formula you’ll need:
Energy per prompt (watt-hours) × Water factor (milliliters per watt-hour) = Water per prompt (in milliliters)
For a medium-length query to GPT-5, that calculation should use the figures of 19.3 watt-hours and 2 milliliters per watt-hour. 19.3 x 2 = 39 milliliters of water per response.
For a medium-length query to GPT-4o, the calculation is 1.75 watt-hours x 2 milliliters per watt-hour = 3.5 milliliters of water per response.
If you assume the data centers are more efficient, and use 1.3 milliliters per watt-hour, the numbers drop: about 25 milliliters for GPT-5 and 2.3 milliliters for GPT-4o.
A recent Google technical report said a median text prompt to its Gemini system uses just 0.24 watt-hours of electricity and about 0.26 milliliters of water – roughly the volume of five drops. However, the report does not say how long that prompt is, so it can’t be compared directly with GPT water usage.
Those different estimates – ranging from 0.26 milliliters to 39 milliliters – demonstrate how much the effects of efficiency, AI model and power-generation infrastructure all matter.
Comparisons and context
To truly understand how much water these queries use, it can be helpful to compare them to other familiar water uses.
When multiplied by millions, AI queries’ water use adds up. OpenAI reports about 2.5 billion prompts per day. That figure includes queries to its GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 and GPT-5 systems, with no public breakdown of how many queries are issued to each particular model.
Using independent estimates and Google’s official reporting gives a sense of the possible range:

All Google Gemini median prompts: about 650,000 liters per day.
All GPT 4o medium prompts: about 8.8 million liters per day.
All GPT 5 medium prompts: about 97.5 million liters per day.

For comparison, Americans use about 34 billion liters per day watering residential lawns and gardens. One liter is about one-quarter of a gallon.
Generative AI does use water, but – at least for now – its daily totals are small compared with other common uses such as lawns, showers and laundry.
But its water demand is not fixed. Google’s disclosure shows what is possible when systems are optimized, with specialized chips, efficient cooling and smart workload management. Recycling water and locating data centers in cooler, wetter regions can help, too.
Transparency matters, as well: When companies release their data, the public, policymakers and researchers can see what is achievable and compare providers fairly.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/waterpfascancer-2048x1492-1-1024x746.jpg,,,2025-09-02 07:56:20.956513

BOSTON — In some of his first public comments since being shot in an attempted assassination, Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman urged fellow lawmakers to refocus on the true purpose of public service.
“We can’t let the evil of the night win, and we must redouble our efforts and reclaim the reason we are all public servants,” he said.
That means listening to one another, extending understanding even in disagreement, and finding compromise: “not because it’s easy, but because the people we serve deserve better than constant stalemate built on partisan egos. They deserve solutions.”
Hoffman appeared via video message before thousands of lawmakers and staffers gathered at the National Conference of State Legislatures summit earlier this month in Boston. In June, he and his wife were shot in their Minnesota home just before the politically motivated shooter killed state Rep. Melissa Hortman, the former House speaker, her husband, Mark, and their dog, Gilbert.
The June shooting hung over this year’s meeting of the NCSL, a group that labors to maintain a reputation for bipartisan and nonpartisan work. Lawmakers in attendance on the left and the right repeatedly lamented the toxicity of American politics and the growing threat of political violence at local levels of government.
Many lawmakers raised questions about whether public service is still worth it, how state governments can buck the partisanship that defines Washington, D.C., and what measures lawmakers should take to keep members safe. Most lawmakers said they remained committed to serving, but they said conservatives and liberals must find ways to disagree without demonizing their opposition and do better at monitoring the rhetoric of members of their own parties.

Wisconsin House Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, said the vitriol of social media and cable news has made it more difficult to talk with people of differing beliefs. Technology has reduced the frequency of many human interactions, he said. Even the rise of video doorbells has made it difficult for candidates and officials to talk with everyday constituents in person, as many refuse to answer.
“So instead of knocking on doors and meeting strangers, you have a tendency to go to party events where you are meeting people who want to come and meet you,” he said. “Well, they come from usually one end of the spectrum. They’re people who are probably paying too much attention to politics and not enough to all the other things in the world.”
Author and media personality Michael Smerconish asked Vos whether the current climate pushes good candidates away and incentivizes “zealots” to run.
“That’s a really good point,” Vos responded. “Part of my job is to recruit candidates, and it is very challenging to get people who are willing to put their personal life on the line and convince their family that there is nothing more fun to do on a Sunday morning than to go to a pancake breakfast.”
He said potential candidates are worried about how their kids will be treated in school and what effect running could have on their careers. But he said state governments can model a more civil political tone and show how government works. Even simple moves like holding bipartisan meetings with staff — rather than holding separate caucus meetings — can help to forge more positive relationships.
“We are places where people can disagree, but we don’t have to be hateful,” he said. “And maybe, just maybe, over time we’ll be able to showcase to the rest of the country that that’s the way that legislatures lead.”

‘Hold people accountable’ 
Since the June shooting in Minnesota, liberal and conservative states alike are considering measures to bolster protections for candidates and elected officials.
Legislation proposed in New Jersey would prohibit the publication of home addresses of lawmakers, adding them to a list of protected officials that includes judges and law enforcement. That legislation remains in committee.
ln North Dakota, lawmakers are considering establishing a more formal process for reporting threats, the North Dakota Monitor reported. A North Dakota man was charged in June with sending threatening messages to officials in which he referenced the Minnesota shootings. Legislative staff have already removed the home addresses of lawmakers from the legislative website and are considering providing post office boxes for lawmaker mail and creating new safety training.
Pennsylvania lawmakers will soon introduce a package of bills to boost legislator safety, limit their public exposure and ensure representation if a lawmaker dies while in office, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported.
In Oregon, House Speaker Julie Fahey said lawmakers and staff are thinking more about personal safety. State law doesn’t allow candidates to use campaign funds for security purposes, but the Democratic speaker said the legislature may soon change that.



I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact.


– Oregon House Speaker Julie Fahey, a Democrat



During an NCSL session about the cost of public service, Fahey referenced protesters’ 2020 armed breach of the state Capitol in Salem and noted that she’d had an angry constituent show up at her home.
She said lawmakers and staffers need to talk more about the cost of their work, which can be isolating, especially for those in leadership positions.
“I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact,” she said.
Sitting next to her, West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said it’s not just personal safety that weighs on lawmakers.
It’s just as taxing on spouses and families — who he said are “front and center” in any conversation about running for office nowadays.
When he first assumed his leadership position in 2018, Hanshaw said he saw his job as mostly confined to running the chamber and worrying only about the behavior of members in their official capacity. But his thinking has evolved in this political environment, which he said requires modeling and monitoring of personal behavior and online activity of members of his caucus.
“That was the wrong approach,” he told Stateline. “And I would say that to anyone who’s coming into one of these roles: You need to set the example and you need to hold people accountable.”
‘What is your why?’
Pennsylvania Democratic House Speaker Joanna McClinton said the current political environment is markedly different because officials at all levels of government can be targets.
“And what we must all collectively do is to condemn the violence, to bring the tone of rhetoric down and out of our capitols, and most importantly let folks know that we can always agree to disagree, but we can never, ever allow there to be violence in discourse,” she said in an interview.

While the climate has not deterred her from serving, McClinton said it does provide an opportunity to underscore the solemnity of public service and helps frame a candidate’s purpose for running and deciding whether it’s worthwhile.
“What is your why?” she said she increasingly asks potential candidates. “What is your purpose? What do you plan to achieve, to accomplish? Why is it that you want to do this?”
Tim Storey, the chief executive officer of NCSL, said state legislatures are more bipartisan than many realize. Even in dogged legislative fights, many bills ultimately pass with support from both sides — or even unanimously.
“There’s a relatively small group who just demonize the other side,” he said in an interview. “I think for the most part, they still see each other as humans who are actually in a really unique job, and so only they can understand each other and the sacrifice and the pressure that gets put on by the public exposure.”

He said that was especially true following Hortman’s assassination.
“They felt it across the aisle of both parties,” he said.
Storey said NCSL’s Boston summit was a record-breaker with more than 1,600 state lawmakers and thousands more staffers and lobbyists in attendance.
The event kicked off with two of Minnesota’s top legislative leaders — a Democrat and a Republican — on stage in front of a packed ballroom talking about the assassination.
Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth said Hortman had always treated her as a partner rather than an adversary. With mutual trust and respect, they could “disagree without being disagreeable,” she said.
State Sen. Erin Murphy, the Democratic majority leader, said politicians must turn down the vitriol in their rhetoric.
“I think a lot of America would appreciate that. I know Melissa would,” she told the crowd.
But she said lawmakers must also root out dehumanizing narratives and conspiracy theories that have led to the radicalization of so many individuals.
“We can’t lose faith in each other. We can’t lose faith in America,” she said. “As Melissa taught us, failure is not an option.”

Should you be worried about climate change? The answer used to be debatable — literally.
Way back in 2007, NPR aired a debate over the proposition that “Global Warming Is Not a Crisis.” The panel had six commentators, divided equally into two sides. Those on the “not a crisis” side (which included Jurassic Park author and nonscientist Michael Crichton) argued that much of the current alarm was based on “ignorance.” Sure, the climate was changing, but that wasn’t anything new, they said. They weren’t convinced carbon dioxide was driving it this time around, either.
Those stuck arguing that global warming was not not a crisis — an awkward double negative — countered that the scientific community was in near-universal agreement that CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions were at fault. They laid out the dire consequences (rising seas, shrinking ice caps, warming oceans) and called on the audience to think of the planet their children and grandchildren would inherit.
Afterward, the conservative think tank The Heartland Institute declared that the climate “realists” had beaten the “alarmists.” Polling the audience, NPR found that 57 percent thought that global warming was a crisis before the debate, but only 42 percent did afterward. The results seemed to confirm the fears that participant Gavin Schmidt, a NASA climate scientist, had outlined on his blog ahead of the event. “Is this kind of rhetorical jousting useful for clarifying issues of science … ? Or does it just validate the least serious opposition?” he wrote.
In 2010, around the time when these kinds of debates were popular, almost half of Americans falsely believed there was a lot of disagreement among scientists that climate change was happening. Fast-forward to today, and the public’s understanding has evolved. More Americans acknowledge that scientists agree on climate change. People are also increasingly worried about the consequences: The intense floods, wildfires, and heat waves battering the country have sparked concern not only for the future, but for the present.
And yet the old way of discussing climate change — framing it as a debate — appears to be coming back into fashion, this time spurred by the federal government.
A new report from the Department of Energy, “A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate,” arrived in late July. “Climate change is a challenge — not a catastrophe,” Chris Wright, the Trump-appointed energy secretary, declared in the foreword. He wrote that the public conversation on climate change had “drifted from the science” because of exaggerated media coverage, potentially leading to “misguided policies based on fear.”
While the report acknowledged that yes, the planet is getting warmer, and yes, it’s caused by humans, it argued that these changes aren’t as bad as you think. It contended that carbon dioxide is good for plant growth, that computer models are overstating predictions of future warming, and that sea level rise isn’t accelerating. These conclusions were no surprise considering that the report’s five authors — John Christy, Judith Curry, Steve Koonin, Ross McKitrick, and Roy Spencer — have a long track record of pushing back against mainstream narratives about climate change.
Among those who care deeply about climate change, the report sounded alarm bells. Critics pointed to its use of selectively chosen data. A fact-check from the data journalism nonprofit Carbon Brief identified more than 100 cases of false or misleading claims in the 140-page document, with some researchers saying their cited work had been mischaracterized. Some scientists, led by Andrew Dessler at Texas A&M University, have begun organizing an academic response to the report.
“It is a shock to see the U.S. government, in an official document, deny scientific realities and spew so much disinformation,” said Rachel Cleetus, a senior policy director for climate and energy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
But getting scientists riled up might have been intentional. One of the report’s authors, Koonin, recently told E&E News that the expected pushback to the DOE report is part of a long-standing effort to create a “red team, blue team” exercise that could revive the “debate” over climate change.
“Red team, blue team” is a reference to an adversarial military exercise used to expose weaknesses. The idea, with roots in 19th-century Prussian war games, took off in the U.S. during the Cold War in the 1960s and has since become popular in cybersecurity. Companies will hire a “red” team to try to poke holes in their “blue” team’s digital defenses. These provocations help companies bolster their defenses against actual hackers.
The red team, blue team idea was floated by an EPA official during President Donald Trump’s first term as a way to challenge mainstream climate science. Before that, it had been raised by Spencer, another author on the 2025 report, as early as 2009. For a matter like climate change, however, a loud red-team attack has the effect of making the whole field look wobbly, split into two equally divided sides.
“It can really create perceptions of false equivalence in the public sphere,” said Max Boykoff, an environmental studies professor at the University of Colorado Boulder.
Matt Burgess, an environmental economist at the University of Wyoming, said that the context of the DOE report — the Trump administration’s broader assault on climate information — makes it hard to take it seriously. While the DOE report was underway, officials removed congressionally mandated climate reports on how climate change affects life in the United States from the federal website they lived on. The administration has also cut billions in funding for climate programs and research, and has proposed halting projects that monitor climate change.
On the same day the DOE report was released in July, the Environmental Protection Agency fired another shot at climate science, saying it would roll back the Obama-era finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health — the scientific foundation that allows the agency to address climate change. In its proposal to repeal this so-called “endangerment” finding, the EPA cited the new DOE report, and many have interpreted it as a pretext for the EPA’s announcement.
So the “blue team” pushed back. Two environmental groups, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists, filed a lawsuit against both agencies earlier this month, arguing that Wright had secretly arranged for five “hand-picked skeptics” to write a report challenging the scientific consensus on climate change. The lawsuit alleges that involving a “secret, unaccountable” group in policymaking concerns violated federal law. (The DOE did not respond to a request for comment for this story.)
But scientists may want to be careful in how they push back at the report, since arguing over fringe viewpoints may have the effect of amplifying them, falling into the same trap created by the climate debates of 20 years ago. One study from 2023 found that disinformation about climate change was more emotionally compelling and persuasive to people than scientific facts. To Cleetus, the government’s revival of the climate “debate” is a distraction from the task at hand. “We’re losing precious, precious time to help stave off these terrible impacts of climate change,” Cleetus said. “And I don’t know what we will say to our children and grandchildren, that this is what we wasted our time on.”
Much of the polarization around climate change appears to stem from disagreements over what to do about it. In recent years, many advocates have justified faster action — more regulations, fewer fossil fuels, and more green technology — by appealing to “science.” The Biden administration even enshrined “listen to science” as its official policy. But while science can inform policy decisions, it doesn’t answer the question of how to navigate the complex moral and cultural issues that come with reimagining life after fossil fuels.
The political left has used the science-has-all-the-answers framing to shut down important conversations about real trade-offs, said Travis Fisher, who helped organize the DOE report. He is also the director of energy and environmental policy at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. He says that by using “the science” as justification to push through controversial policies, it invites skepticism in science as an objective force.
“There’s only so many times you can get hit with that, like, trademark ‘science’ club before you start saying, ‘Hey, what’s actually in that club that you have?’” Fisher said. “‘Is it as solid as you say it is?’”
It bears repeating that upward of 97 percent of climate experts agree that human-caused climate change is happening, but there are many areas of climate science that merit further study. For example, the question of whether climate change affects tornadoes (not yet clear) or just how quickly and strongly CO2 emissions will drive global warming in the future. (The DOE report argues that the planet is less sensitive to CO2 than commonly believed, while scientist James Hansen argues that it’s actually more sensitive.) Science is always evolving as new evidence comes in, and it takes many studies to create a sufficient body of evidence before a causal argument can be accepted.
Take that famous 97 percent stat from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, for example. According to the organization, it came from “not just … a single study, but by a converging stream of evidence over the past two decades from surveys of scientists, content analyses of peer-reviewed studies, and public statements issued by virtually every membership organization of experts in this field.”
To Burgess, the environmental economist, the messy context around the DOE report represents a missed opportunity — particularly because he thinks the critics make some good points. There are certain narratives, especially around the severity of climate impacts, he said, “that are underappreciated in the mainstream discourse.”
But the solution, Burgess said, isn’t war-room style debates — it’s open, transparent collaboration between what might be described as the “blue team” and “red team.” As an example of a way to encourage thoughtful engagement, he pointed to the University of Pennsylvania’s Adversarial Collaboration Project, which encourages scholars who disagree to work together to resolve polarizing scientific disputes.
“We do ourselves and the community a favor when we dispassionately try to, through things like adversarial collaboration, get to the bottom of genuine scholarly debates about how to interpret facts,” Burgess said. “Even if we don’t like the people who interpret the facts differently than we do.”
Wright has hinted that the DOE’s report, which is open to the public to comment, may just be the start of the administration’s move to stir up debate over climate change. “We’ll probably have public events here in D.C. this fall,” he said in an interview with CNN earlier this month. “We want to have an honest dialogue with the American people about climate change.”
Burgess interprets the whole episode around report differently. “I think it’s just basically another opportunity for people to yell at each other online and go back to their silos,” he said.

(Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)The panel established by Gov. Mike Kehoe to write rules for how long people who break the law must stay in prison may be violating the law itself by meeting in secret.
As one of his first acts as governor in January, Kehoe ordered the Department of Corrections and the Division of Probation and Parole set up a working group for a comprehensive study of parole rules. The group is to work toward “the goal of providing clarity, transparency, and accountability for the parole process.”
The only time the 15-member panel has met in public was June 13, when it held a 25-minute public hearing in the Capitol Building. Since then, it has met three times without posting any notice of the time or place of the meeting or allowing the public to attend.
Missouri governor’s parole study group urged to focus on transparency, fairness

The next meeting is Sept. 18, when according to one member the panel will present ideas in writing for inclusion in the working group’s report, due Oct. 1. 
“The working group is violating the Missouri Sunshine Law,” Amy Malinowski, Missouri director of the MacArthur Justice Center, said in an email to The Independent. “According to general counsel for the (Department of Corrections), they do not prepare agendas for or minutes from meetings. Nor do they publish notice of any meetings, whether open or closed. (It is) cruelly ironic since one of the things Gov. Kehoe asked this working group to focus on was transparency.”
Malinowski wrote several emails in July to the Division of Probation and Parole asking for notice of upcoming meetings. 
“Please be advised we are following all guidelines for this executive order and offered more than what was required by hosting an open public forum and creating a special email account for constituents to submit concerns and requests,” Glenda Owens, executive assistant to the Parole Board, wrote in reply.
When Malinowski responded by stating the working group needed to follow Sunshine Law guidelines for meeting notices, Owens disagreed.
“No public notice is required as it is not an open meeting,” Owens wrote.
A governmental body subject to the Sunshine Law must post a notice of the time and place it intends to meet, with an agenda of items to be discussed, at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting. 
To hold a closed meeting, the body must first meet in public, with an agenda that cites specific exemptions in law that allow for closed meeting discussions. The body must hold a roll-call vote to go into a closed session.
The Sunshine Law also specifically includes “any advisory committee or commission appointed by the governor by executive order” in the definition of public governmental bodies.
That specific statement, said Dan Curry, legal advisor to the Missouri Press Association, makes the working group “subject to all Sunshine Law requirements.”
The Department of Corrections disagrees.
Spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said in an email to The Independent that parole board staff believe “the working group meetings are not public meetings/hearings.”
The executive order “does not require public hearings to be held — only to ensure that the working group includes a variety of stakeholders, including members of the public and formerly incarcerated people,” Pojmann said. “The public hearing held June 13 was an effort to get input from the public, as was the establishment of the email address for collecting public comment. Four meetings have been held so far, with a fifth planned for next month.”
Having the working group meet in secret violates the spirit of Kehoe’s executive order as well as the Sunshine Law, Malinowski said.
“It’s doubly concerning, because one of the specific issues they’re supposed to be working on is transparency,” she said. “How can we take seriously their recommendations with regard to transparency when they’re not taking seriously a very clear legal obligation regarding transparency?”
A spokeswoman for Kehoe did not respond to a request for comment. 
 Working group issues

Missouri has about 24,000 people incarcerated in the 19 adult prisons, with new admissions and releases each running at more than 11,000 per year. The Division of Probation and Parole had 13,809 men and women under parole supervision at the end of June 2024, the most recent data available.
In the brief public hearing, advocates for incarcerated people called on the group to bring more predictability to parole hearing dates, provide more feedback to people denied parole and shorten the time between a hearing and a release date.
They also asked the working group to look at how new interpretations of existing rules have added years, and sometimes decades, to the time required before parole eligibility.
Missouri math: How a 23-year sentence adds up to more than 40 years in prison

The boundaries on the working group’s recommendations are things that can be done through revisions to regulations. Tony Helfrecht, the chairman of the Missouri Board of Probation and Parole, is leading the working group and he said at the public hearing that it would not be considering recommendations for changing state law.
The regulations define the portion of a sentence that must be served before parole eligibility. They also define the structure of parole hearings such as who can speak or have representation, and the conditions a person on parole must meet to remain out of prison.
Helfrecht’s vice-chair is Trevor Foley, director of the state corrections department. Six other members are corrections department employees or members of the state parole board, and five represent the judiciary and law enforcement. Two public members, including Courtney Everett, program coordinator for the St. Louis University Prison Education Program, were previously incarcerated.
In an interview last week, Everett said the working group has met twice, in July and August, and will meet again on Sept. 18. He said he has asked for more public sessions, especially so people who have dealt with the parole system can testify.
“I’m just hearing stories that are blowing my mind, but everyone needs to hear it, and it’s difficult for me if I spent the hour with the mom, to take the notes and represent that in a Zoom meeting,” Everett said. “That’s just too hard for me to do.”
Everett said he was concerned that the working group would have an anti-inmate bias when he saw the list of members. 
“I went into this with a lot of trepidation, because I didn’t think we would be heard, but I feel like everyone’s listening,” Everett said. “I feel like everyone’s open-minded.”
The public should know what issues the working group considers important and what resources are being used to address them, Malinowski said. The MacArthur Justice Center has identified several areas to work on and she presented them at the public hearing.
“Who knows when we’ll get another opportunity like this to take a hard look at the regulations and change things?” Malinowski said. “Even the chairman himself described it as a once in a decade opportunity. So I want assurances that they’re making the most out of that opportunity, and, right now, I have none.”
 Next steps

Everett said in an interview that he would like the working group to get an extension on the Oct. 1 deadline.
“This is something that should take longer than a few months,” Everett said. “It’s just so much. There’s so many layers to it. We can’t do it in six months.”
The MacArthur Justice Center is weighing whether to take legal action over the Sunshine Law issues, Malinowski said.
One barrier, she said, is that the lawsuit would take far longer than the time left before the working group issues its report. The department has stopped responding to her on the open meetings questions, she said.
“They are not posting public notices of meetings. They are not preparing agendas for meetings,” Malinowski said. “They are not maintaining minutes of meetings. Yet these are all things the Missouri Sunshine law requires them to do. How, then, can we have any confidence in the forthcoming recommendations from the group?”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Jefferson-City-Correctional-Center-04022025-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-09-02 07:56:20.956513

Emanuel Cleaver said Monday he will see them in court. 
Speaking to reporters at a Labor Day event in Kansas City on Monday, the 11-term Democratic congressman said he has no intention of going quietly into the night as the GOP targets his seat. 
Asked if he’s committed to running for another term representing the 5th District — even if Republicans break it up into multiple districts — Cleaver said: “I’m committed to going to federal court.”
“I mean, I’m not committing to lay down and talk about running, unless I’m running to the lawyer’s office,” Cleaver told reporters. “We’re going to file a lawsuit.”
Cleaver suggested the fact that the map would rely on outdated population figures may violate the U.S. Constitution. Other Democrats contend the new map would also run into issues with the Missouri Constitution.
On Friday, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe called lawmakers back to the Capitol this week to redraw the state’s congressional map. 
Missouri governor calls lawmakers back to Capitol to gerrymander congressional map

Missouri has eight congressional districts, with two held by Democrats. The new map would split Kansas City, which is currently entirely in the 5th District, into three districts where Republicans would have an electoral edge. 
The intended result is a map where the GOP holds nearly 90% of the state’s seats in the U.S. House.
The current map was drawn in 2022, following the U.S. Census. 
Mid-decade redistricting is rare. In Missouri, it hasn’t happened since the 1960s. But President Donald Trump, facing a potentially difficult midterm election cycle next year, has demanded GOP-controlled states redraw maps to add more Republican seats. 
On Friday, Trump praised Kehoe for calling the legislature back into session and instructed state lawmakers to pass the new map “AS IS” without any changes. 
Cleaver said the way the districts are drawn makes it clear the map released by the governor’s office was drawn by the White House. 
“The White House designed the map,” he said. “This map was not drawn in Missouri.”
For proof, Cleaver said look no further than the fact that the Kansas City School District is split between two districts.
“That’s absolutely crazy,” he said. 
In unveiling the new map, Kehoe insisted it was “drawn and created” by his team in Missouri.

But that's proving easier said than done for the rapidly developing, and shifting, technology.","Frederick County public schools superintendent Cheryl Dyson talks with a student at Gov. Thomas Johnson High School last week, during the first day of school for students in the county. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Brayden Morgan says artificial intelligence is here to stay and everyone should embrace it.
“We have to adapt. We have to stay up to date,” said the 17-year-old high school senior and student member on the Anne Arundel County Board of Education. “We have to learn about it and make sure our students know how to use it [the] right way [and] that they’re learning and not being enabled on technology.”
That may be easier said than done.
The technology better known as “AI” is already being used by students and teachers in Maryland schools. But the state has yet to develop specific statewide guidelines on how to effectively use the powerful new computing tool, and what guardrails to protect students from using it inappropriately such as plagiarism on essay papers and other work.
State education officials have been working behind the scenes for more than a year on language, and county school systems have made tentative steps toward developing their own policies. But it’s been slow going.

Jing Liu said there’s a couple of reasons many school districts in Maryland, and the nation, don’t yet have artificial intelligence policies in place.
“The AI space is developing really, really fast. All the AI tools are developed at lightning speed,” said Liu, an associate professor in education policy at the University of Maryland, College Park.
Liu, who’s also directs the school’s Center for Educational Data Science and Innovation, said evidence-based research needs to be done quickly to help inform policymakers and school district leaders on how to design AI policy. He said a policy would include certain tools used to meet education standards and guardrails to ensure appropriate uses.
“I think we are still at a very early stage in terms of understanding their [AI] impact,” Liu said. “There hasn’t been a lot of research looking at the impact of particular AI users on teacher and student learning outcomes.”
Maryland education officials said they have been working behind the scenes on AI guidance for more than a year.
A document from the state Board of Education summarizes artificial intelligence frameworks such as potential benefits like tutoring and personalized learning assistance, aiding creativity and collaboration and operational and administrative efficiency. Some of the risks are plagiarism and academic dishonesty, overreliance and loss of critical thinking, and perpetuating societal biases.
State Superintendent Carey Wright said in an interview Thursday that statewide guidance on AI could be released by the end of the school. In the meantime, Wright has advice for educators and other school leaders on effectively using AI in schools.
“The things that I would hope they’re doing is developing lesson plans that are aligned to our standards. That’s key because our statewide assessment is aligned to our standards,” she said.
“We don’t want just a hodgepodge of things being taught,” Wright said. “So, anything that they can do that is going to make their life easier, but also guiding children in [what’s] appropriate and what’s not appropriate, in terms of the use of AI.”
School district look
A few school districts have implemented AI guidelines.
Prince George’s County school leaders began a three-year implementation plan last school year that stresses professional learning, ethical considerations and curriculum integration.
State Board of Education requests cell phone use policies, won’t mandate them

For the 2025-26 school year that began last week, there will be follow-up meetings with stakeholders, training workshops for staff and school administrators to start assessing how to implement AI instruction in the classroom.
Students in Calvert County can read about it in their new student code of conduct. The guidelines highlight definitions, educational and ethical uses, academic integrity and supervision and monitoring.
There’s also a warning for prohibited conduct: “Any misuse of AI tools will be subject to disciplinary action. In certain circumstances, law enforcement may be notified.”
Frederick County Superintendent Cheryl Dyson said the school board there is working on an artificial intelligence policy.
Last year, Dyson said curriculum writers used AI to generate topics related to the curriculum that young people would be interested in.
As for teachers, Dyson said they will not only know whether students produced their own work, but also help guide them to think critically.
“When you learn [the abilities of] a student, you can tell when something is an anomaly,” she said. “It’s really about explicit teaching of the writing process, or any process really about learning, because we want to know what they [students] know, not what the computer knows.”
Maryland State Education Association president Paul Lemle provided an example on how he utilized AI last year as a social studies teacher. Lemle asked students to compare a few political ads, but he also required that they make ads of their own.
“It was OK for them to use AI in that assignment,” he said. “If they wanted to use it to research the ads that they were comparing, fine. If they wanted to use it to suggest lines in their script, fine.
“But the AI couldn’t tell them this kind of ad will work in this kind of political context. They had to make that decision for themselves,” Lemle said.










One thing about AI is that it’s a genie that’s out of the bottle. We’re not going to place that back.


– Darilyn Mercadel, program coordinator, elementary education, Bowie State University College of Education


Tiffany Carpenter, 25, said she began to use artificial intelligence during the first week of school to help with a lesson plan for the entrepreneurship class she teaches at Dr. Henry A. Wise Jr. High School in Prince George’s County. Part of that plan, she said, was utilizing AI to design a logo.
“AI’s logo-making isn’t always perfect, so I just use that as a template so that I can get a start,” said Carpenter, who’s going into her fourth year teaching at Wise. “It’s giving you ideas, not the final product. That’s what I tell and show my students. AI is just a tool to help. They still have to do the work and learn from it.”
But without a 100% guarantee, there remains an unknown that students can utilize that technology and easily obtain good grades.
‘Do more together’
With an ongoing statewide and nationwide teacher shortage, aspiring teachers will need to be taught about how to effectively integrate artificial intelligence into the classroom.
Darilyn Mercadel is doing just that at Bowie State University, where she is teaching several classes and is the coordinator of elementary education programs in the school’s College of Education.
Before students are enrolled in college, high school students already know how to use AI technology through computer programs such as ChatGPT, developed and released in 2022 by OpenAI. ChatGPT can translate complex topics into simpler sentences. In addition, the user can ask questions through text, audio or even image prompts.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But Mercadel stressed there’s other programs such as Adobe Firefly that generate graphics and edit photos; Intellectus that analyzes and breaks down data; and the “Siri voice recognition program on iPhones.
Mercadel said students use a tutoring service program called “CircleIn.” Not only does the program provide academic support, it can also be used to collaborate with their peers. But to ensure aspiring educators, which she calls “preservice students,” understand a particular topic, Mercadel will also give an oral exam.
“There are other means that we can assess students besides your usual paper, or your typical test that we used to give before AI,” she said. “One thing about AI is that it’s a genie that’s out of the bottle. We’re not going to place that back.”
The effectiveness of AI has decreased Mercadel’s time to plan her courses from about two weeks to an hour. She stressed the human element is integrated because “AI can’t do things that humans can do, which is the emotional side and the understanding of our students. It gives me more time to get to know my students and families.”
Mercadel, who taught early childhood education in Prince George’s and Montgomery counties, said another positive with AI is interacting with students who may be hearing impaired.
“Now students are able to swipe that doesn’t require that occupational hand holding of a pencil and can tap or swipe to communicate. That’s a huge difference,” she said. “It’s assistive technology. We have these tools that make it easier, but that also gives us time to do more together.”



ChatGPT says it’s OK
As a polic, Maryland Matters does not use AI to write stories, but we did ask ChatGPT, one of the most popular programs, if AI should be allowed in K-12 classrooms for students and teachers. We were told in a split-second, “Yes … with clear boundaries, ethical safeguards, and developmentally appropriate practices in place.” Which it went on to list:
Why AI should be allowed in K-12
1. Enhances teaching and learning

For Teachers:

Saves time (e.g., grading drafts, generating lesson plans, adapting materials).
Enables differentiated instruction and support for diverse learners.


For Students:

Offers personalized learning (e.g., adaptive math platforms).
Improves accessibility (e.g., AI captioning, translation for ELLs).
Can support creativity and exploration (e.g., storytelling, art, simulations).



2. Builds essential future-ready skills

AI literacy will be as critical as digital literacy.
Students need to understand AI’s capabilities, limits, and ethical dimensions.
Introducing AI responsibly prepares students for a workforce increasingly shaped by automation and machine learning.

3. Promotes equity (if managed carefully)

With proper funding and access, AI can help close gaps in learning support.
It can provide real-time feedback and scaffolding for students who need it most.

But use must be carefully controlled
AI should not be used indiscriminately. The risks of misuse, bias, over-reliance and data misuse are real, especially for younger students. Uses, by grade level, should be:

Kindergarten-2nd grader should use teacher-controlled tools for tasks like speech-to-text, storoy generation and reading apps.
Grades 3-5 should have high supervision with AI image tools, math help and idea generation.
Grades 3-8 call for guided creative and assistive use for essay feedback, science simulations, chatbots.
Grades 9-12 allow responsible, independent use for research, peer review, coding help and ethical analysis.

When AI should not be used

For final grading decisions or disciplinary choices.
As substitute for human connection, mentorship, or social-emotional support.
In a surveillance capacity (e.g., emotion tracking, behavior prediction).
Without full transparency with parents and students.

Final position: Allow AI, with guardrails
AI belongs in the classroom — not as a replacement for teachers or learning, but as a tool for enhancing both. Its use must be:

Age-appropriate
Ethically grounded
Transparent
Optional and opt-in where appropriate
Accompanied by teacher training and student AI literacy education

On a scorching Monday in August, I participated in a consequential conversation on the energy crisis facing our state and learned about the actual contributors to inhibitive cost increases.
At an event hosted by STONO Public Affairs, 30 faith leaders from around the state conversed with the president of the Board of Public Utilities, Christine Guhl-Sadovy, about the impact of rising electric bills on New Jersey’s low-income communities and what programs exist to help customers experiencing devastating challenges paying their bills.
New Jersey offers a range of assistance programs that, unfortunately, few people know exist or how to access. As someone who hears from congregants and community members every day about their financial struggles, I commend STONO and the Board of Public Utilities for jointly organizing this event to make visible the people hurting most acutely from this reprehensible energy crisis.
This moment of affordability chaos necessitates that faith communities, government, and community-based organizations do more to bridge the gap and raise awareness around these programs, as our neighbors and family members suffocate under the tightening squeeze of unchecked energy costs.
Every year, we see more days with extreme temperatures due to climate change, with historically Black, brown, and low-income communities living in sections of towns where temperatures are 7 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit higher than in more affluent communities inhabited by white people. The combination of extreme weather and escalating power costs uniquely compounds the health and financial crises that countless families struggling to get by know all too intimately. 
While improving outreach to communities about available assistance will help to stop the bleeding, we, likewise, have a moral obligation to address the root cause of this odious crisis. A growing consensus among utility providers, academics, and advocates alike continues to take shape concerning the direct link between our rising energy costs and increased demand due to the rapid expansion of data centers and artificial intelligence. Despite agreement on the causes, there is little discussion about long-term solutions to these escalating costs for those who can least afford them.
The expert class, business leaders, and everyday users laud artificial intelligence as the most tremendous technological advancement since the advent of the internet. Companies are stampeding forward to invest in their own AI systems, claiming it will lead to innovation across sectors and ultimately yield a big payday for countless people. The unfortunate side effect of this promising new sector is the massive amounts of energy AI data centers use.
At the onset of this new technological revolution that portends to amplify creativity and generate unimaginable wealth, we should be equally creative in our attempts to meet this moment differently than we did at the onset of the internet. Rather than allowing this revolution to overburden and punish the vulnerable, we should find creative ways for it to subsidize those who will see repressive upticks in expenses due to the actions of techno-capitalists. For people living paycheck to paycheck, a 20% increase on a $200 to $300 electric bill is enough to break the bank.
We must find ways for this technology to be an unadulterated good for everyone instead of a burden for low-income people merely trying to get by. It’s sinful to tie our hands, bury our heads in the sand, or permit our tongues to cling to the roofs of our mouths while corporations get rich on the backs of working families. 
We are not asking companies to stop pursuing innovation and teasing out new possibilities from AI. We’re simply asking these corporations to pay their fair share. If the industry intends to endure, data-center developers — makers of these humming plants of consumption — must chip in for wide-reaching and systematic utility assistance and invest in the infrastructure necessary to support their energy demands. Sustainability for these companies looks like returning something to the people who make their profits possible.
What opportunities did we miss before the dawn of the internet and social media to ensure that they would be assets and not burdens to the rest of society? What tax considerations did we miss that would have benefited the least among us and the innovators who created the technology? 
We obviously missed opportunities for fairness and justice at the dawn of the internet, but the stakes are too high now for us to allow history and the present to rhyme by repeating the same mistakes. We know more about the causes and effects of climate change alongside the polarizing residual effects of technological advancements like social media. We can ill-afford another revolution to happen without drawing clear guidelines to ensure the titans of industry pull their weight. 
The gravity of this swelling crisis calls for an economics of repair as the only legitimate moral response to reinforce the undying dignity of hardworking people straining to make month and money meet. No one working two jobs and driving Uber to keep the heat and hope on should bear the cost of increased demand usage by the billionaire data center industry. In fact, it should be the opposite: A family should enjoy financial relief on their utility bill because this billion-dollar industry is able to exist. We have a chance to do things right this time around. Let’s not squander it.

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Nearly 1,000 state employees are waiting to learn if they will be allowed to quit their jobs under a voluntary separation that aims to shrink the size of state government and cut expenses.
Of the thousands who were notified of the early out program in July, a total of 980 employees had applied by the Aug. 4 deadline, state officials said.
Not all of them will be allowed to quit. The state is reviewing the applications and decisions will be based on “the mission and priorities of the agency and … an evaluation of whether the function of the position is required,” a spokesperson for Gov. Wes. Moore (D) said in an email. Workers also have to have worked at least two years for the state to take advantage of the program.
The Department of Budget and Management plans to notify employees in mid-September of whether their application for separation has been accepted or not. When they unveiled the program in late June, administration officials insisted that they did not have a specific target in mind for the number of workers they were hoping would leave, only that it was one part of a larger effort to cut $121 million in state personnel expenses.
“The VSP [voluntary separation program] is one of several actions the governor has implemented to achieve the $121 million reduction, including the hiring freeze already announced,” a DBM spokesperson said in an email when the program was announced.

While they could not predict how many might ultimately be accepted into the buyout program, the governor’s office said similar voluntary separation program in 2015 realized a 38% acceptance rate.
According to details on the DBM website, the buyout offer, first announced in late June, was available to full-time employees in the executive branch with at least two years of service. Those accepted will get $20,000, plus an additional $300 for each year of service. The state will cover six months of paid state health benefits after their separation, and departing workers will also be paid for any unused leave and compensatory time.
Workers who take the buyout have to agree not to work for the state again for at least another 18 months, and their positions will be eliminated once they leave.
There were nearly 52,000 positions within the state personnel and Maryland Department of Transportation personnel systems, about 4,800 of which were vacant as of May, the DBM spokesperson said at the time. About 13,500 are in job classifications that are not eligible for the buyout offer, including police and correctional officers, judicial and legislative employees, and close to 60 other offices, ranging from the Attorney Grievance Commission to the Canal Place Preservation and Development Authority.
Workers at the state’s colleges and universities are also ineligible, although the executive order creating the program allows several of the universities to set up their own buyout programs if they wish.
Of the 980 workers who applied for the porogram, 862 were employed as part of the State Personnel Management System and the remaining 118 were employed by the Maryland Department of Transportation, according to an administration spokesperson
DBM spokesperson Raquel Coombs said last month that a more specific breakdown of the departments the applicants came from was confidential.
Representatives for both the American Federation of Teachers-Maryland and American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees said their unions were waiting for more information on the breakdown of employees.
The governor’s office had originally proposed eliminating 150 vacant government positions, implementing a hiring freeze and offering some buyouts to meet the $121 million personnel cost reductions that were mandated as part of the fiscal 2026 budget approved by the General Assembly this spring.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But lawmakers and union representatives differed from the administration on what personnel cuts were required, and they specifically pushed back against the notion of layoffs.
AFSCME said several critical “24/7” agencies — hospitals, public safety and prisons, for example — are already understaffed and covering vacancies with overtime, and insisted that any further personnel reductions not cut into service.
“Any solutions to help our state navigate these tough and volatile times must not come at the cost of providing quality state services,” the union said in a statement when the buyouts were announced.
Besides trimming personnel, the union said the state should look at “eliminating costly contracts, in-sourcing services where needed, addressing other inefficiencies, and closing corporate tax loopholes to raise much-needed state revenues” to cut costs.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/state-house-flag-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-02 07:56:20.956513

“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
 Nonmedical exemptions

Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.










We are endangering each other.


– Dr. Rana Alissa, Jacksonville, Fla., pediatrician and president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics


Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
 Other vaccines

Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.
Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
 ‘Normalization’ of outbreaks

During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.
“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

(Courtesy photo)Tamiqua Whittaker was inspired to launch her homemade cosmetics business while working full time in the dental field.
Watching her patients struggle with dry lips during and after checkups inspired the Tulsa resident to develop her first homemade cosmetic product, an all-natural lip scrub. 
To ensure her products are safe and effective on different ages and skin types, she tests them on herself, her children and her husband. She also researches industry standards, and her background has taught her best practices in sterilization and how to prevent cross-contamination.
Building on the success of her lip balm, Whittaker created the brand Queen Kisses and scaled it up to a three-part lip restoration system that includes lip exfoliators, balms and a nighttime aloe mask consisting of less than five certified organic or locally sourced ingredients from makers or growers in Tulsa or surrounding areas. 
“What sets my business apart is that I am a licensed dental professional who started this endeavor, so I have the experience and knowledge necessary for caring for such a sensitive and important part of your face,” Whittaker said.
Whittaker’s lip balms are a part of a quickly growing but largely under regulated sector in Oklahoma and nationally – the handmade cosmetic industry.

The market for natural cosmetics in the United States is expected to grow by nearly 71% by 2030 and reach almost $1.1 billion, according to a 2024 analysis by the Chemical Abstracts Service. The group, which aims to connect scientific knowledge to accelerate breakthroughs, said more consumers are shunning mainstream products, which contain synthetic chemicals, in favor of natural, sustainable and customized products. The growth of social media has also opened up opportunities for small business owners to showcase and pitch their homemade products to large numbers of people.
But experts, including the Food and Drug Administration, warn that the handmade cosmetic industry is a buyer-beware market for consumers. Because there is little state and federal oversight of the burgeoning industry, they acknowledge that some homemade cosmetics could be misbranded or contaminated because they don’t have to be approved before use. 
An FDA spokesperson said the federal agency does not approve cosmetics before they are sold but does regulate them after they become available on the market. 
“The FDA does not provide specific resources or educational programs for small or home-based cosmetic producers,” an agency spokesperson said. “As a regulatory agency, our priority with regard to cosmetics is ensuring that products are unadulterated and properly labeled.”
In Oklahoma, the State Board of Cosmetology and Barbering is responsible for the protection and education of consumers who perform cosmetology services. The agency provides proper training for applicants and requires them to pass a written and practical examination. 
If a consumer has a complaint about a business or product, they can submit it to the state board. The complaint will then be reviewed and acted upon if necessary. 
The agency did not comment about how it regulates handmade cosmetics.
Whittaker, though, said the state board primarily leaves regulation to the FDA, and it’s up to small business owners to stay abreast of the latest compliance regulations and requirements. She supports the current regulatory levels because she might not have been able to grow her home brand from nothing if the state had more stringent regulations.

“Too many regulations could make the entrepreneurship dream a bit more of a reach for those aspiring,” Whittaker said. “Too many regulations ensure certain (items and ingredients) are unobtainable by us common folk capable of creating our own success, and even further limit options for those of us brave enough to attempt entrepreneurship.”
But she acknowledged there are bad actors in her industry, which local and state agencies struggle to regulate.
“That’s really a Catch-22 answer,” Whittaker said. “Too many regulations hurt us honest business owners, but not enough creates issues for consumers.” 
Ken Marenus, president and CEO of the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors, said the industry is oversaturated with personal care brands, and small businesses often struggle to find ways to stand out. 
But the growing competition hasn’t deterred LaVonda Robinson, an entrepreneur and CEO of Growing Hands LLC.
“My passion and happiness in my job is seeing the hair grow back and remain healthy,” she said. Robinson, of Tulsa, creates hair growth oils that are tailored to meet specific needs of each of her clients because there wasn’t one specific product on the market that could accommodate them all. 
“I wanted to make a product that was safe and that helped maintain that natural, healthy look and feel,” she said. 
Robinson said there are plenty of similar products being “marketed as healthy and effective,” and while she’s sure about the safety of her product, she isn’t as confident about others on the market.
“(My) question is, ‘Are they really safe, and do they really work?” she said.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/OklahomaVoice)A four-member, state board tasked with overseeing the investment of nearly $2 billion intended to make Oklahoma healthier has suddenly decided it’s also the morality police, and our last line of defense against the “dubious values” of corporations.
This mighty band of self-styled superheroes disguised as mild-mannered bankers and accountants refuses to be deterred by the pesky fact that we – thankfully and intentionally – don’t actually have a formal set of state values.
Chock full of delusions of grandeur and hyperbolic fearmongering, the Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust board of investors, led by state Treasurer Todd Russ, is convinced that 10 major corporations could open them up to backlash. They’re concerned that these businesses could potentially face litigation that could endanger the worth of the endowment’s investments.
They didn’t say which companies they’re talking about during their Aug. 20 meeting, although Russ has acknowledged that they’re so profitable that it doesn’t make financial sense for the board to divest itself of them right now. 
So instead, the board is using our money to try to force shareholders to vote on changing a bunch of policies including “anti-trafficking,” charitable giving “discrimination” and the dispensing of prescription medications.
And adding insult to injury, the board described unnamed companies that everyday Oklahomans have voluntarily chosen to do business with — like a credit card company, a major aerospace company that has a location in the heart of Oklahoma City, and a nationwide wholesaler that dispenses prescription medication at discount prices.
Based on the hypothetical examples they tossed around during a public meeting, this seems like a bizarre and ill-thought out crusade that will do little more than make Oklahoma look ridiculous – again.
By their estimation, a big box store  is selling so much of the drug mifepristone that it could wind up affecting pregnancy rates. Yes, by their calculations, allowing a woman more control over when she becomes pregnant means fewer kids, which equals fewer diapers sold, which could, in turn, harm TSET’s overall investment returns.
What?
That’s rich coming from a board that works on behalf of an entity whose mission is to improve public health and distributes millions each year to achieve that (the endowment has taken credit for the state’s plummeting cigarette smoking rate for the past two decades, for instance). Yet, the board that is tasked with managing their money apparently doesn’t understand the value of doctor-patient relationships or the fact that mifepristone is used for other purposes than medical abortions.
This board also spouted off some bizarre theory that a major credit card company could be complicit in the distribution of images of child sexual abuse by allowing customers to use credit cards to pay for the illegal images. Yet, if this board had bothered to read the fine print on their credit card agreements, they’d know that reputable credit card companies explicitly prohibit the use of credit cards for anything against the law. Plus, if this were a widespread problem, wouldn’t the authorities already be investigating? 
And if that wasn’t enough, they’re also apparently fearful that a big, scary aerospace company might have diversity, equity and inclusion policies that could affect their bottom line and potentially cause them to lose federal contracts. Yet, they seem perfectly happy to forget that ours is a state that isn’t graduating enough engineering majors to meet demand.
Is it any wonder that multinational companies don’t want to come to Oklahoma?
Why does a state board believe that it needs to lead the charge to fix perceived ills? If there’s one thing the public is very good at, it’s speaking with their money – or their social media accounts. 
Just ask Cracker Barrel.
The restaurant chain unveiled a new modernized logo last month, which incurred the public wrath. Shareholders rebelled, and the company’s value plummeted nearly $100 million. Stocks quickly rebounded after Cracker Barrel abandoned the effort. 
So why would the endowment investment board do this now?
It turns out our investor board wasn’t acting under a directive from lawmakers, the governor or anyone else, Russ has said. So, they were acting simply because they wanted to.
That is scary in itself. But don’t forget they’re appointed by our state House and Senate leaders, the state auditor and the governor. The chair — our state treasurer — is elected by us all.
Only the state auditor’s appointee had the gumption to push back against this campaign. He told his fellow board members that this isn’t the best way to do business.
These shenanigans, by the way, happened while lawmakers and the governor are trying to flex their power and have greater influence over TSET board of director appointees. I wasn’t really sure why that was a bad thing until this clown show happened. I suspect this is probably exactly why voters wanted lawmakers to have limited influence on how tobacco settlement money is spent.
Ironically, an adviser who spoke at the meeting said that it is “activists” bringing public pressure that often shapes company policies. The Oklahoma board’s plans offer shareholders an alternative, he said.
Merriam-Webster defines activist as “a person who uses or supports strong actions (such as public protests) in support of or opposition to one side of a controversial issue.”
In a stroke of beautiful irony, this board has become the kind of people they purport to fear.
So maybe these investors should leave the politicking and lobbying to the people we’re actually paying to do it.
Because you know what could harm this endowment’s returns by opening it up to litigation? Taking questionable public votes that potentially violate the Open Meeting Act by posting vague, secretive agendas, and using our public funds as leverage to try to shove the board’s own “values” down the throats of multinational corporations that seem to be doing just fine without the assistance of these “superheroes.”

Comprehensive consumer privacy laws are taking effect in eight states this year. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)This year, comprehensive privacy laws are going into effect in eight states to regulate how businesses handle digital information and to give consumers more protections over their personal data.
The laws in Delaware, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Tennessee have taken effect already this year, according to a database from the International Association of Privacy Professionals’ Westin Research Center. Maryland’s privacy law, signed by Democratic Gov. Wes Moore last year, will go into effect Oct. 1.
Privacy laws enacted in Indiana, Kentucky and Rhode Island will go into effect next year.
Several other states are considering comprehensive privacy bills during this year’s legislative sessions. They include Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
When a person visits a website, applies to a job or logs into an online portal, they may be sharing their personal information. Comprehensive privacy laws can apply to a wide range of companies that participate in this kind of data collection.
These laws generally include two types of provisions — those related to consumer rights and those that establish business obligations, according to the association.
Under each of the new laws, consumers have the right to control when and how their data is collected and shared. Some of those provisions include the right to delete data from a company’s database, the ability to opt out of sharing sensitive information and the right to prohibit a company from selling their data.
The new measures also require businesses to ask consumers if they want to opt in to data collection. In some states, businesses are required to complete consumer data risk assessments and identify ways in which discrimination could take place. Some companies also may be required to limit to how consumer data is processed.
In 2018, California became the first state to enact comprehensive privacy legislation for consumers in the state; the law went into effect in 2020. Virginia and Colorado enacted laws in 2021. Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas and Utah also have comprehensive laws that have taken effect, the database shows.
Other states have passed measures with more specific data protections this year. California, Colorado and Montana, for instance, passed legislation that aims to protect sensitive brain data collected by devices outside of medical settings, KFF Health News reported earlier this year.
One bill under consideration in New York would establish data privacy protections for children. And another measure in Pennsylvania aims to improve consumer data protections with genetic testing companies.
Without comprehensive federal protections, state lawmakers are driving the push to protect consumers from having their personal information shared without their knowledge.

Ninety-two years after George Brimmer spearheaded a statewide effort to create town parks, his grandson boosted the family legacy.
The post Wallace’s Grand Teton National Park conservation rivals his grandfather’s Jackson Town Square appeared first on WyoFile .","To celebrate the 200th anniversary of George Washington’s birthday, a Wyoming gubernatorial committee in 1932 rallied towns across the state to create city parks in memory of the nation’s first president. In a widely successful campaign, one of the many places set aside was the 1.09-acre Town Square in Jackson, now enjoyed by millions of visitors every year.
Back then, “town authorities” designated Block One of the Clubhouse Addition as a park, the town nurtured park-appropriate “plant material” and citizens, “by private subscription,” raised $150 for landscaping and other work.
Commission chair George Brimmer relayed the success to Cheyenne in 1933, documenting the end of the board’s official work — with a caveat. As private citizens, commission members would “continue until there is a full consummation of the plans.”
Brimmer, a Riverton attorney schooled in law at New York City’s Columbia University and awed by that metropolis’s Central Park, might not have imagined a legacy larger than the elk-antler-arch Jackson Town Square — an international icon visited by masses on the way to Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks.
“I knew after that summer I wanted to be part of the parks in this part of the world.” Rob Wallace
Ninety-two years on, however, private citizens’ work continues. And Brimmer’s grandson may have bested the old man by 638.91 acres.
The Teton Science Schools will honor grandson Rob Wallace today with the Murie Spirit of Conservation Award, recognizing years of public-lands advocacy and his “most consequential” achievement — playing an instrumental role in the preservation of the Kelly Parcel in Grand Teton National Park.
“It’s something nobody will know about,” Wallace said of the conservation struggle he aided from just offstage. “It was a series of very interesting things that all went right at the same time.”
Murie legacy
The Science Schools celebration honors national and local conservation leaders and this year also recognizes Amy Brennan McCarthy, CEO of the Teton Raptor Center, who will be named a “local legend.” She is a wildlife conservation leader recognized for ecosystem science-oriented community programming.
The Science Schools will bestow the awards at the Murie Ranch in Grand Teton where Mardy Murie, called the country’s “mother of conservation,” along with her family and others conceived the modern conservation movement.
Wallace followed a winding path as he wended his way toward the recognition. An Evanston youth whose father was an attorney and mother, Nancy Wallace, was a two-term representative in the Wyoming Legislature, he found delight as a youth in the Uinta Mountains and Medicine Bow National Forest.

And also rascality with his sophomore townie high school buddies. It wasn’t a single illicit party that made his mother put her foot down.
“It was more than one,” he said.
She settled on him spending his last two high school years in the New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell, New Mexico. 
“She thought I might have a better chance for a little more focused life if I left Evanston for a couple of years,” Wallace said.
Focus he did, attending the University of Texas studying petroleum engineering. After college and before a required ROTC Army stint, he got a position as a seasonal ranger in Grand Teton National Park.
“I had a job before they had standards,” he said. “It was an epiphany. I knew after that summer I wanted to be part of the parks in this part of the world.”
Into the parks
After brief Army service, Wallace spent four years as a seasonal park ranger, “paid to be outdoors, on the rivers, climbing mountains, riding horses,” he said.
He also saw the policy makers – senators, congressmen, cabinet members – drift through Grand Teton on dutiful sojourns. “How do these people come up with these policies,” he wondered about the far-from-Wyoming beltway bunch.
Serendipity took him to a Cheyenne rally where Malcolm Wallop was launching an improbable Senate run against Gale McGee. Wallace accepted an on-the-spot offer to be the first on Wallop’s campaign staff.
McGee sought his fourth term. “You had to be crazy to take him on,” Wallace said. But Wallop “just caught the wave — sort of the early years of the sagebrush rebellion.”

Myriad jobs in public land policy and energy followed. He was back in Wyoming for a few years working on a water project, was Wallop’s chief of staff and Republican staff director for the Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
He jumped at the chance to work for the National Park Service as head of congressional affairs, shepherding a policy that allowed parks to keep 80% of the fees charged at entrance stations.
He ran for Congress in 1994, coming in second in the primary to Barbara Cubin. Jim Geringer, who was also in the race, eventually won election as Wyoming governor and tapped Wallace as chief of staff.
There’s more: 17 years seeing the world with General Electric, then unanimously confirmed by the Senate as assistant secretary for fish and wildlife and parks at the U.S. Department of the Interior, a post he held from 2019 to 2021.
Independent conservation
Along the way Wallace kept his hand in independent conservation. He helped launch several Wyoming initiatives and was a founding member of the Grand Teton National Park Foundation.
That group forged a new Park Service policy in the early 2000s allowing independent nonprofits to boost park projects. Until then, “all things we find important were centrally planned in the Denver Service Center,” he said. “They would pass that down from Heaven.” The construction of the Craig Thomas Visitor Center “proved that [new] model worked,” Wallace said.
Preserving the Kelly Parcel, his “most consequential” achievement, was a drama with a large cast of characters and a tortured plot. It involved the entire Legislature as the chorus and leading roles by Gov. Mark Gordon, Wyoming Sen. Mike Gierau and Wyoming Treasurer Curt Meier.
“There were so many different near-death experiences during that time,” he said of the purchase.
The Legislature for years considered selling the 640-acre Wyoming school section that covered a critical migration crossroads inside Grand Teton. Debate swirled over whether it should go to the park or be put on the block for the highest bid and potential private development.
By law, the federal government couldn’t spend more than the $62.4 million appraised value for the square-mile section. Wyoming lawmakers believed they could get more at auction. One raised the bid, proposing $100 million.
With Wyoming’s price set, conservationists huddled – “Who’s going to call Leslie?”
That’s the indefatigable Leslie Mattson, head of the Grand Teton National Park Foundation. Her mission, and she chose to accept it, was to raise $37.6 million in a few months to make up the difference and meet an end-of-2024 legislative deadline.
At a nail-biting Wyoming Board of Land Commissioners’ meeting in November 2024, Treasurer Meier cast the deciding vote in favor of the sale.
Mom was right
“Curt Meier was the hero in my mind,” Wallace said. The treasurer agreed the plan met all conditions the Legislature imposed on the sale. “Curt did his homework and said, ‘I’m with you too,’” Wallace said.
Then came “a race across Wyoming,” a modern-day Pony Express.
Jason Crowder, deputy director of the state land office, “took off with the deed and papers,” Wallace said. He met Jeremy Barnum, Grand Teton’s chief of staff, in Shoshoni.
It was a scene out of a spy movie, Wallace said, a rural settlement in a windswept winter landscape with “two guys in heavy coats swapping documents.”
With that, the Brimmer/Wallace legacy stood at 641.09 acres, all perhaps because of a Wyoming state representative from Evanston who set her son on the straight-and-narrow.
Wallace might have missed some bender high school parties in Evanston, but acknowledges his mom’s wisdom.
“She was right,” he said.

Colorado, which sued, retained 10 of 11 grant terminations, while neighboring Wyoming retained none.
The post Blue states that sued kept most CDC grants, while red states feel brunt of Trump clawbacks appeared first on WyoFile .","The Trump administration’s cuts to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funding for state and local health departments had vastly uneven effects depending on the political leanings of a state, according to a KFF Health News analysis. Democratic-led states and select blue-leaning cities fought back in court and saw money for public health efforts restored — while GOP-led states sustained big losses.
The Department of Health and Human Services in late March canceled nearly 700 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants nationwide — together worth about $11 billion. Awarded during the COVID-19 pandemic, they supported efforts to vaccinate people, reduce health disparities among demographic groups, upgrade antiquated systems for detecting infectious disease outbreaks and hire community health workers.
Initially, grant cancellations hit blue and red states roughly evenly. Four of the five jurisdictions with the largest number of terminated grants were led by Democrats: California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, and Massachusetts.
But after attorneys general and governors from about two dozen blue states sued in federal court and won an injunction, the balance flipped. Of the five states with the most canceled grants, four are led by Republicans: Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Ohio.
In blue states, nearly 80% of the CDC grant cuts have been restored, compared with fewer than 5% in red states, according to the KFF Health News analysis. Grant amounts reported in an HHS database known as the Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System, or TAGGS, often don’t match what states confirmed. Instead, this analysis focused on the number of grants.

The divide is an example of the polarization that permeates health care issues, in which access to safety-net health programs, abortion rights and the ability of public health officials to respond to disease threats diverge significantly depending on the political party in power.
In an emailed statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the agency “is committed to protecting the health of every American, regardless of politics or geography. These funds were provided in response to the COVID pandemic, which is long over. We will continue working with states to strengthen public health infrastructure and ensure communities have the tools they need to respond to outbreaks and keep people safe.”
The money in question wasn’t spent solely on COVID-related activities, public health experts say; it was also used to bolster public health infrastructure and help contain many types of viruses and diseases, including the flu, measles, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.
“It really supported infrastructure across the board, particularly in how states respond to public health threats,” said Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
The Trump cutbacks came as the U.S. recorded its largest measles outbreak in over three decades and 266 pediatric deaths during the most recent flu season — the highest reported outside of a pandemic since 2004. Public health departments canceled vaccine clinics, laid off staff and put contracts on hold, health officials said in interviews.
After its funding cuts were blocked in court, California retained every grant the Trump administration attempted to claw back, while Texas remains the state with the most grants terminated, with at least 30. As the CDC slashed grants in Texas, its measles outbreak spread across the U.S. and Mexico, sickening at least 4,500 people and killing at least 16.
Colorado, which joined the lawsuit, had 11 grant terminations at first, but then 10 were retained. Meanwhile, its neighboring states that didn’t sue — Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma — collectively lost 55 grants, with none retained.

In Jackson, Ohio, a half-dozen community health workers came to work one day in March to find the Trump administration had canceled their grant five months early, leaving the Jackson County Health Department half a million dollars short — and them without jobs.
“I had to lay off three employees in a single day, and I haven’t had to do that before. We don’t have those people doing outreach in Jackson County anymore,” Health Commissioner Kevin Aston said.
At one point, he said, the funding helped 11 Appalachian Ohio counties. Now it supports one.
Marsha Radabaugh, one employee who was reassigned, has scaled back her community health efforts: She’d been helping serve hot meals to homeless people and realized that many clients couldn’t read or write, so she brought forms for services such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to their encampment in a local park and helped fill them out.
“We would find them rehab places. We’d get out hygiene kits, blankets, tents, zero-degree sleeping bags, things like that,” she said. As a counselor, she’d also remind people “that they’re cared for, that they’re worthy of being a human — because, a lot of the time, they’re not treated that way.”
Sasha Johnson, who led the community health worker program, said people like Radabaugh “were basically a walking human 411,” offering aid to those in need.
Radabaugh also partnered with a food bank to deliver meals to homebound residents.
Aston said the abrupt way they lost the funds — which meant the county unexpectedly had to pay unemployment for more people — could have ruined the health district financially. Canceling funding midcycle, he said, “was really scary.”
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and promoter of vaccine misinformation, has called the CDC a “cesspool of corruption.” At HHS, he has taken steps to undermine vaccination in the U.S. and abroad.
Federal CDC funding accounts for more than half of state and local health department budgets, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. States that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election received a higher share of the $15 billion the CDC allocated in fiscal 2023 than those that Democrat Kamala Harris won, according to KFF.
The Trump administration’s nationwide CDC grant terminations reflect this. More than half were in states that Trump won in 2024, totaling at least 370 terminations before the court action, according to KFF Health News’ analysis.
The Columbus, Ohio, health department had received $6.2 million in CDC grants, but roughly half of it — $3 million — disappeared with the Trump cuts. The city laid off 11 people who worked on investigating infectious disease outbreaks in such places as schools and nursing homes, Columbus Health Commissioner Mysheika Roberts said.
She also said the city had planned to buy a new electronic health record system for easier access to patients’ hospital records — which could improve disease detection and provide better treatment for those infected — but that was put on ice.
“We’ve never had a grant midcycle just get pulled from us for no reason,” Roberts said. “This sense of uncertainty is stressful.”
Columbus did not receive its money directly from the CDC. Rather, the state gave the city some funds it received from the federal government. Ohio, led by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and a Republican attorney general, did not sue to block the funding cuts.
Columbus sued the federal government in April to keep its money, along with other Democratic-led municipalities in Republican-governed states: Harris County, Texas, home to Houston; the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County in Tennessee; and Kansas City, Missouri. A federal judge in June blocked those cuts.
As of mid-August, Columbus was awaiting the funds. Roberts said the city won’t rehire staff because the federal funding was expected to end in December.
Joe Grogan, a senior scholar at the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Institute and former director of the White House Domestic Policy Council in Trump’s first term, said state and local agencies “are not entitled” to the federal money, which was awarded “to deal with an emergency” that has ended.
“We were throwing money out the door the last five years,” Grogan said of the federal government. “I don’t understand why there would ever be a controversy in unspent COVID money coming back.”
Ken Gordon, Ohio Department of Health spokesperson, wrote in an email that the $250 million in grants lost had helped with, among other things, upgrading the disease reporting system and boosting public health laboratory testing.
Some of the canceled HHS funding wasn’t slated to end for years, including four grants to strengthen public health in Indian Country, a grant to a Minnesota nonprofit focused on reducing substance use disorders, and a few to universities about occupational safety, HIV, tuberculosis and more.
Brent Ewig, chief policy and government relations officer for the Association of Immunization Managers, said the cuts were “the predictable result of ‘boom, bust, panic, neglect’ funding” for public health.
The association represents 64 state, local, and territorial immunization programs, which Ewig said will be less prepared to respond to disease outbreaks, including measles.
“The system is blinking red,” Ewig said.


Methodology
KFF Health News’ analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants sought to answer four questions: 1) How many grants have been terminated in the U.S. under the Trump administration since March? 2) Which states saw the most grants cut? 3) What were the grants for? and 4) Did the grant terminations affect blue, red, and purple states differently? This follows a similar analysis by KFF Health News for an article on nationwide NIH grant terminations.
Our primary data source was a Department of Health and Human Services website showing grant terminations. We compared an initial list of grant terminations from April 3 with one from July 11 to determine how many grants had been restored. The USAspending.gov database helped us track grants by state.
To classify states politically, we followed the same steps from our April coverage of National Institutes of Health grant terminations. States were “blue” if Democrats had complete control of the state government or if the majority of voters favored Democratic presidential candidates in the last three elections (2016, 2020, 2024). “Red” states were classified similarly with respect to the Republican Party. “Purple” states had politically split state governments and/or were generally considered to be presidential election battleground states. The result was 25 red states, 17 blue states, and eight purple states. The District of Columbia was classified as blue using similar methods. 
This analysis does not account for potential grant reinstatements in local jurisdictions where the funds were awarded indirectly rather than directly from the CDC; it accounts only for the recipients’ location, and excludes grants terminated from Compacts of Free Association states and other foreign entities that received grants directly from the CDC. At least 40 CDC grants were terminated that were meant for global health efforts or assisting public health activities in other nations following the Trump administration’s order for the CDC to withdraw support for the World Health Organization.

Property taxes are a big issue in Wyoming, but not everyone wants more tax breaks that come with a huge price, columnist Kerry Drake writes. 
The post Hi, we’re from the Wyoming Freedom Caucus and we’re not here to help you appeared first on WyoFile .","I stood in line at the Freedom Caucus Complaint Department for hours, watching woke people tell the clerk what they thought of his politics and then leave in a huff. Finally it was my turn.

Opinion

“Hello, what can I do to — I mean for — you today?” said the clerk, a balding old conservative white guy. I forget his name, but it really doesn’t matter because they all think and vote alike anyway.
“I’m here today about property taxes,” I said.
“Oh, no need to thank us,” he said, smiling. “We just did what all of Wyoming wanted us to do: cut your property taxes so you can spend your hard-earned money on something besides giving it to a government that doesn’t need it. 
“A vote for us next year is all the thanks we want. There are a lot more property tax cuts coming, I can assure you,” he said. “We’ve only just begun. Next!”
“No, no, I didn’t come to thank you,” I said. “I came because I want you to stop.”
A quizzical look came across his face. “I don’t understand,” the clerk said. “You didn’t like your property tax cut? We gave you several to choose from.
“There’s one for old people who’ve paid property taxes for at least 25 years, and a property tax refund program that we put more money into. Then there’s one for everybody, up to the first million dollars of your home’s value.”
“That’s part of the problem,” I said. “You gave us so many, it’s confusing. People don’t know what they qualify for.”
He chuckled. “Now I know where you’re coming from,” the clerk said. “We did that so people would complain, like you’re doing, so we could say, ‘Look folks, this tax system has gotten way out of control. What we need to do is get rid of all property taxes!’ That’s next on our agenda.”


“That’s the worst idea I’ve ever heard,” I said. “Giving us the across-the-board 25% cut you did would have been OK, as long as you put enough state money back in for local governments, special districts and schools to keep their budgets whole. But you didn’t, so they’ve had to cut.
“How are cities, towns and counties supposed to keep providing essential services, like law enforcement and fire protection, and fix roads?” I asked. “Then there’s a long list of special districts. Hospitals are closing their maternity wards, and some are at-risk of closing completely.”
The clerk cut me off. “I’m sure you’re aware, sir, that the Freedom Caucus knows all governments are too big, and the liberal elites will stop at nothing until they tax you to death,” he said. “We’ve said, ‘Enough! Use your reserves until they’re all gone, and then cut, cut, and then cut some more. People don’t need everything handed to them.”
I knew where this was leading. “But I pay property taxes for a reason,” I said. “I want an ambulance to come when I need it. I want parks, recreation and libraries in my town.”
He smiled again. “The Freedom Caucus wants libraries, too,” he said. “But we don’t want them filled with smut and sex stuff and books that suggest God created more than two genders. If you’d like, you can come back this afternoon and one of our Moms for Liberty can fill you in on our plans.”
“Oh, I already know your plans,” I said. “And I don’t like them one bit. You guys say you want freedom, but only for yourselves to tell the rest of us how to live. You even tell pregnant women they must deliver a baby, even if they’re a victim of rape or incest.”
The clerk held up his hand, and pointed at a sign on the wall: “One topic per complaint, please.”
“Very well, I’ll go back to property taxes,” I said. “Here’s my final complaint. Wyoming collects $2 billion in property taxes every year. If you take that away, how is anything going to be funded? Are you going to just raise the sales tax rate to a ridiculous amount, which means everyone but the rich must pay a huge percentage of their income for the services they now get from property taxes?”
The clerk clapped his hands and shouted, “Bingo!”
“You’re doing this just to keep getting elected, aren’t you?” I shouted. “If you win on one issue, you’re going to keep at it no matter what the consequences are.” 
“You sound like some of the people who came to a legislative committee meeting in Casper last week,” he replied, speaking in lower tones so I had to step closer to hear him. “They accused us of just playing politics with these property tax cuts to get elected.
“Frankly, it hurt some of our feelings,” he added, and pretended to sniffle, followed by an uproarious laugh.
“Now you’re mocking me,” I said. “This isn’t real, is it? Why in the world did I think the Freedom Caucus would have a complaint department? You only listen to yourselves.”
“Yes, you’re dreaming,” the clerk said. “But thanks for dropping by, and don’t bother to vote. Next!” Then he shoved my head backward, and I woke in bed.
“What a nightmare,” I thought, then tried to go back to sleep. It took a while, but when I finally dozed off, I found myself back in line at the complaint department. I guess I had more to say to that imaginary Freedom Caucus guy, and he’s the only one of that bunch who’d listen to me at all.

(Photo courtesy of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, Miami Field Office)More cities and states have responded to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s threat to prosecute them over so-called sanctuary policies limiting law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration enforcement — some by thumbing their noses, at least one by acquiescing.
Written responses defending sanctuary policies have been sent to Bondi from cities including Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Hoboken, New Jersey; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle, along with the states of California, Connecticut, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington. Many noted that courts so far have upheld their right to limit cooperation with deportations.
“Pam Bondi seeks to have Washington state bend the knee to a Trump administration that, day by day, drags us closer to authoritarianism. That’s not going to happen,” Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, said in an Aug. 19 news conference.
Louisville, Kentucky, is one city that agreed to more cooperation after a confrontation over the issue — before Bondi threatened prosecution in August, but after the attorney general said she had issued a “strong written warning” to the city.
The city had stopped complying in 2017 with so-called detainer requests to hold jailed residents for immigration authorities, but leaders resumed cooperation to avoid being targeted for more raids.
“Cities on the sanctuary city list right now are experiencing a terrifying increase in raids by ICE, including mass raids,” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg, a Democrat, said in a July 22 statement. “I’ve talked with leaders within our immigrant community before I made this decision. I heard their fears loud and clear about current federal policies and ICE actions. I also heard that they want Louisville off the federal sanctuary city list.”
Bondi issued a revised list of sanctuary cities, counties and states in August.
Rochester, New York, meanwhile, in August amended its municipal code to strengthen its policies against cooperation by adding disciplinary measures for personnel who violate the policy. State Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, had earlier supported the city’s existing policies in court, saying in a statement that they “keep communities safe and allow local law enforcement to use resources to address local public safety priorities.”
In Boston, Democratic Mayor Michelle Wu’s response letter accused the Trump administration of “false and continuous attacks” as part of a campaign to “divide, isolate, and intimidate our cities, and make Americans fearful of one another.”
U.S. District Court Judge William Orrick issued a new order Aug. 22 extending a preliminary injunction to more cities, counties and states that had asked for protection against President Donald Trump’s executive orders and agency directives. Trump sought to withhold unrelated federal funding based on similar sanctuary policies.
Orrick’s ruling found the orders and directives are likely to be unconstitutional violations of local rights to set limits on immigration enforcement cooperation.
The injunction covers 50 areas in 14 states: California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.
Trump administration lawyers asked Aug. 26 to dismiss the case, arguing that the administration’s actions so far “merely instruct agencies to assess federal grant programs to determine where they can lawfully add immigration related conditions.”
A hearing is scheduled Oct.22.

Aug. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — The vice president and longest-serving member of Nebraska’s State Board of Education will not seek reelection in 2026.
Deb Neary of Omaha confirmed to the Nebraska Examiner that she will not seek a third four-year term. Neary, whose background has focused on nonprofit leadership and education research, said she is proud to have built a “reputation as a dynamic leader committed to driving positive change across multiple sectors.”
Reflecting on her service, Neary said she has been a “steadfast advocate” for student success, educational equity and strong support for Nebraska’s public schools.
“Serving on the State Board of Education has been one of the greatest honors of my life,” Neary said in a statement. “I’ve had the privilege of working with parents, educators and community leaders across Nebraska to strengthen opportunities for every student, and I am proud of the progress we’ve made together.”

District 8 voters first elected Neary, a Democrat, in 2018 over incumbent Pat McPherson of Omaha, a Republican. The district is now in central Douglas County.
Health education and politics
Among Neary’s highlighted accomplishments is advocating for science-based, age-appropriate health education standards in 2021, which were ultimately not adopted. Nebraska is one of just two states without K-12 health education standards.
Neary said throughout the “often-contentious” debate that year, she prioritized constituent engagement through town halls and community forums while listening to parents and educators. 
The fight embroiled the officially nonpartisan ed board in national controversy and ignited a series of changes to the makeup of the State Board of Education. In part, the fight awakened a new crop of conservatives and progressives to participate more in state and local politics, including at the Nebraska Legislature and State Board.
The changes began in December 2021 when then-Gov. Pete Ricketts appointed conservative Kirk Penner of Aurora, a former local school board member of 16 years, to a vacancy on the State Board of Education.

Penner led a conservative slate of education candidates in the 2022 election, when half of the board’s seats were up for election. Penner and allies Sherry Jones of Grand Island and Elizabeth Tegtmeier of North Platte sailed to victory, including Tegtmeier over an incumbent. Neary survived a close race against Penner-backed conservative challenger Marni Hodgen.
The Neary-Hodgen fight was among the nastiest in 2022, with supporters and opponents trading barbs, ads and social media posts accusing each other of lies and political extremism.
The 2022 elections left Republicans and Democrats with four seats on the board. One moderate Republican often helped break the gridlock by joining with Democratic members.
That tie-breaking vote helped the board vote 5-3 to select Brian Maher as the state’s new education commissioner in March 2023. Neary called the hiring process one of her proudest moments, with a leadership transition that she said has positioned the Nebraska Department of Education for increased stability and success in a “challenging political climate.”
A changing board
The board again went through major changes as a result of the 2024 election.
All four Democratic incumbents whose seats were up for election declined to run, some citing politics as a reason. While the board stayed split 4-4, voters elected a more reliably conservative member than the member replaced.
The departures left Neary as the longest-tenured incumbent, followed by Penner.

In January, it took 54 votes to elect a president of the board as Republicans and Democrats split 53 times between Tegtmeier and Neary. After the 53rd vote, Neary and Tegtmeier struck a deal to have Tegtmeier be reelected president on a couple of conditions: that Tegtmeier decline to run for president again in 2026 and that committee leadership and assignments be split by policy party affiliation.
With the deal struck, Tegtmeier and Neary received unanimous approval on the 54th and 55th votes for president and vice president.
The board still agrees more than it disagrees, including uniting around a few priorities with Maher — literacy, chronic absenteeism, and teacher and staff recruitment and retention. The board also unanimously voted this June to extend Maher’s contract by one year, to July 2027. In addition, all eight representatives this summer endorsed Maher’s short-lived 2026 campaign for the University of Nebraska Board of Regents, which recently ended.
Looking ahead to 2026, Penner also decided not to seek reelection. He and Neary have endorsed their favored candidates to succeed them.
‘Foundation of opportunity’
Neary said her time in office has been guided by evidence, equity and empathy around a handful of focuses:

Closing achievement gaps and expanding access to high-quality education for historically underserved students.
Defending public schools against what she described as disinformation campaigns and censorship efforts.
Elevating educators and students in policy decisions over partisanship.

She said the board has strengthened its focus on accountability and transparency since 2019.
“Education is the foundation of opportunity,” Neary said. “I will always be a passionate advocate for all Nebraska’s students, families and educators — and I will continue to work to ensure our schools remain among the best in the nation.”

Sherrye Hutcherson of Omaha, who has been with Bellevue University since 2018, publicly launched her campaign Tuesday. She said she is running because education is critical and prepares students for the future.
“It is the foundation for who we are as a country,” Hutcherson said.
Hutcherson is the first candidate to announce for the District 8 seat in central Douglas County since incumbent Deb Neary confirmed her intention not to seek a third four-year term. Neary endorsed Hutcherson.

The eight members of the State Board of Education generally oversee the Nebraska Department of Education. 
Hutcherson said she is a product of public school education and that her parents and many family members were public school teachers or administrators.
“I was the little girl swinging her leg at four years old in school board meetings,” Hutcherson said with a laugh.
Hutcherson said parents should have the choice to make the best decisions for their children, which she said Nebraska’s education system should support. 
She said Nebraska should be a state where all students can be educated, graduate and ultimately find the right job for them.
Those students can then raise families with a “quality life” and continue a cycle, Hutcherson said, which also uplifts the country and its economy.
If elected, Hutcherson said she would pick up where Neary leaves off on long-term Nebraska Department of Education and board goals to improve student literacy, reduce chronic absenteeism and recruit and retain more Nebraska teachers.
“I will be all in on setting these policies at the state level and supporting the school districts at the local level so they can achieve these objectives,” Hutcherson said.
Hutcherson said she believes “emphatically” in a state-local balance and that families must be able to provide input on how their children are educated. She said local and state leaders can “partner” to help students, and she said she doesn’t want to “meddle” in what superintendents and school boards do.

A successful four years in office would mean tackling board priorities, Hutcherson said, including getting more students to come to school more often and better enjoy coming to school. 
Hutcherson earned a degree in accounting from the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff in 1993 and earned a master’s degree in business administration from Creighton University in 2001. She is currently working on a doctorate in interdisciplinary education leadership at Creighton.
Her work history includes Union Pacific Railroad, as a former senior vice president, chief human resources officer and corporate auditor; the Omaha Public Power District, as a former chief administrative officer and HR division manager, among other roles; the Omaha Small Business Network, as executive director and business development officer.
Hutcherson said her past 30 years have centered on objective decisions and policymaking that is representative and also focuses on the greater good.
In her endorsement of Hutcherson, Neary cited Hutcherson’s “exceptional background,” which includes work in education and in the community, including with the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce. Neary said that work “uniquely positions her to lead with vision and balance.”
“Sherrye’s nonpartisan perspective and proven record of service will ensure that Nebraska continues to have a strong, forward-looking education system that meets the needs of all students,” Neary said of Hutcherson.
Hutcherson said she, like Neary, loves children, would fight for students and work to make the best decisions on behalf of students.
“Deb has been fabulous in that, and I will honor that and look forward to doing the exact same thing,” Hutcherson said.
The officially nonpartisan State Board of Education is currently split 4-4 between Republicans and Democrats. Neary, board vice president, is a registered Democrat and won a close reelection in 2022 against a conservative challenger. 
Hutcherson is a registered nonpartisan.
A self-described collaborator, Hutcherson said her top goal will be to keep District 8 families and students at the forefront of all decisions and to use her voice. Hutcherson said board members need to be willing to listen to one another and work toward compromise. 
Said Hutcherson: “I would like to see myself be a part of that … and understand and have the complete facts around the issues that we are addressing … so that we can truly make the best decision for our students and our families in District 8 and in the state.”
The top two finishers in the May 2026 primary will advance to the November 2026 election.

(Getty Images)A task force of Idaho lawmakers is trying to zero in on potential legislative changes they could propose to address the complaints they receive about the state’s child custody and domestic relations system. 
Lawmakers will likely look to address how to handle imbalance in power and resources among parents who are challenging each other for custody of their children, and how to protect parents’ rights to see their children while balancing the safety of the child and keeping them out of potentially dangerous or abusive situations. 
Idaho Legislature’s panel looks to reform child custody laws

The Child Custody and Domestic Relations Task Force met Thursday in Idaho Falls in a lengthy meeting with current and former judges, a trial administrator, a state health agency bureau chief, and three hours of public testimony regarding residents’ personal experiences with child custody battles. 
The task force members questioned family law experts on ways to improve financial inequality in cases, boost enforcement of court ordered custody plans, and appeal or provide oversight over judges making these decisions. 
“Our purpose here is to consider the law, how it’s being applied and whether it should change,” task force co-chair Rep. Tammy Nichols, R-Middleton, said at the beginning of Thursday’s meeting. 
Nichols noted that legislators weren’t there to “second guess” the decisions of individual judges, although dismay at judicial decisions in these matters were at the center of much of the three hours of public testimony. 
The task force cannot write legislation but may present recommendations. 
 Lawmakers question Idaho judges about mediation, attorneys fees   

The task force members heard from former Bonneville County magistrate judge Michelle Mallard, who retired and practiced family law before becoming a Bonneville County commissioner, as well as Bear Lake County Magistrate Judge Todd Garbett.

Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, questioned Mallard about her use of mediation, a process for parents to develop a custody and parenting plan without going to trial. 
“That’s something that we are trying to also understand, because that’s not something that everyone is using,” Ehardt said, “and we feel like it’s a tool that maybe can help both with time and with cost.” 
Ehardt asked if judges could step in if it became clear one party in mediation was not working in good faith. 
Under the rules, mediators cannot tell the judges what is going on in mediation, Mallard responded. But if the mediation fails and the two people go to trial, the judge would be able to tell if one person wasn’t cooperating fully, she said. 
Mallard said few of these cases go to trial, but many of the ones that do are very high conflict. She said family case outcomes are “almost entirely by the motivation of their clients.” “I knew people who profess to want a quick resolution, and after a year of negotiation, it became clear to me they really only wanted revenge,” she said. 
The use of mediation is widespread among courtrooms, Mallard said, but not required. 
If a case does go to trial, a lot of parents represent themselves because the cost of attorneys is high and sometimes the availability of family lawyers is low, Mallard said. When she was a judge, she would utilize an informal trial process, which follows a different set of rules and doesn’t use the traditional question-and-answer model. 
Garbett, the Bear County judge, said about 5% of all Idaho child custody cases go to a trial and are decided by a judge.

Sen. James Ruchti, D-Pocatello, and Rep. John Gannon, D-Boise, both of whom are attorneys, repeatedly asked about awarding attorneys fees to the parent who has less money or less access to legal resources; the Democrats suggested that perhaps the law could be re-written to strengthen a judge’s ability to do so. 
Mallard said that can be done, but awarding attorneys fees happens at the end and can be a “legal quagmire.” 
“The real problem is when you’ve got that imbalance, and you’ve also got this very Ignatius bully who doesn’t care if they spend every last ounce of everyone’s resources to fight this,” Mallard said. “So you can have both a financial imbalance and an emotional imbalance, where some people, even if they have enough money, one party is just not going to fight and the other is.” 
 Judge doesn’t see way to ‘legislate our way’ out of fixing child custody disputes

Committee co-Chair Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, said she kept getting comments from the public about parental rights being taken from one parent and given to the other and asked if that was happening in these trials. 
Garbett specified that termination of parental rights under the law is a rare and specific process, which can be directly and expeditiously appealed to the Idaho Supreme Court. 
“I suspect the way more people are using that is I’ve lost some of my time with the child, or ability to make decisions for the child, and maybe that translates into them,” Garbett said. 
“Using those words, ‘my rights have been taken,’ and those will be a case by case analysis, but I can assure you that as far as actual termination of parental rights, very rare.” 
Sen. Carl Bjerke, R-Coeur d’Alene, asked Garbett for suggestions as to how the Legislature could tighten up the code to get fewer complaints regarding decisions and to ensure the wellbeing of the children involved in the decisions. 
“There is no way that I can think of that we could legislate our way into not hearing these kinds of stories,” Garbett said. “The problem that we have, is the most difficult case is when you have two parents that sincerely want to spend as much time as possible with their child or children, and they’re earnest and they’re honest.” 
He said there’s few decisions that parents are satisfied with in those cases because their time with their children is limited. 
“Imagine only 18 Christmases with a child, and then, if it’s a contested case, you might get half, you’re going to miss out on half of those Christmases,” Garbett said. “That’s a terrible thing for a parent to have to go through. Yet that’s what magistrate judges are required to do when parents aren’t going to live together anymore or never have lived together in those maternity cases.”

 Public members present hours of grievances against judicial decisions in custody and domestic cases 

Thursday’s meeting included about three hours of personal testimony regarding problems people have faced in domestic and child custody cases. 
The testimony often was emotional, detailing experiences such as those of parents with less money to fight for their children’s custody, other frustrated parents who didn’t feel their judge considered the evidence they presented, and fathers who feel the system automatically favors mothers. 
One father said that in his case, he initially had 50/50 custody with his ex wife, but upon his remarriage and “typical adolescent changes” as his child turned 12 and 13, his custody plan was reduced. 
He suggested that Idaho adopt a standard 50/50 parenting plan, with room for changes on a case-by-case basis. 
“Critics argue that 50/50 isn’t always feasible,” he said. “That’s true, but a default standard doesn’t mean one-size-fits-all, it simply means we start from equal footing and adjust when necessary. In my case, no evidence was presented to justify reducing my time. A default standard would have preserved our original agreement and prevented years of emotional strain on my child and our family.” 
Danielle Hendricks, a sergeant detective in the Williston Police Department in North Dakota, spoke to a case she investigated of a father who had been accused of child abuse by his ex-wife and who was later killed in a Lewiston Rosauers parking lot as he was trying visit his children. 
John Mast was shot and killed in 2021 by his ex-father-law, who this month, alongside Mast’s ex-wife, was found criminally liable for Mast’s death, KLEW reported. 
Mast lived in North Dakota at the time, and Hendricks investigated the allegations of abuse against him. Mast was found clear of any wrongdoing, the detective said. 
“I share this story not just to recount a singular tragedy, but to underscore the critical importance of recognizing the devastating impact that false reports can have,” she said. “As a dedicated Child Protection advocate, I believe we must take every allegation seriously, and any person who abuses a child should be held to the highest penalty. But with that being said, we must also ensure that our systems are not misused in any way that leads to irreversible harm to families of children.” 
Multiple testifiers expressed support for requiring child abuse and domestic violence experts to be consulted during cases that involve allegations of those crimes. One woman said the judge in her case was not trained in noticing the signs of domestic violence, including coercive control. 
Other suggestions included judicial oversight such as an ombudsman to investigate wrongdoing in a case and making it more difficult for custody or non-supervised visitation to be awarded to a parent who is a convicted sex offender. 
The task force is scheduled to meet again Sept. 30 in Nampa.

,DC,2025-09-02 10:10:19+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Every fall there’s a government shutdown warning. This time it could happen.,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/every-fall-theres-government-shutdown-warning-time-it-could-happen,,"WASHINGTON — Congress returns to Washington, D.C., this week following an uneventful August recess where little to no progress was made on government funding, even though lawmakers have just weeks left until their shutdown deadline.Republican leaders will need the support of several Democratic senators to approve a stopgap spending bill before Oct. 1, since lawmakers have once again failed to complete the dozen full-year bills on time. But what was once a routine bipartisan exercise has taken on heightened stakes, with Democrats and some Republicans increasingly frustrated by the Trump administration’s unilateral spending decisions.The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office has issued several reports faulting the Trump administration for impounding, or refusing to spend funds approved by Congress, in violation of the law. And dozens of lawsuits have been filed, alleging the administration has acted to supersede Congress’ power of the purse. The ongoing tension, combined with party leaders’ increasing focus on next year’s midterm elections, makes the possibility of a shutdown higher than it has been for years. President Donald Trump said in mid-August he was open to meeting with Democratic leaders once they were back in town to negotiate a government funding deal but minimized the importance of talks. “Well, I will, I guess, but it’s almost a waste of time to meet because they never approve anything,” Trump said.Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries released a letter last week urging Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune to quickly begin negotiating a bipartisan stopgap bill. “The government funding issue must be resolved in a bipartisan way,” they wrote. “That is the only viable path forward.”Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, said last week that she wants to keep advancing the full-year spending bills, but that a short-term stopgap would be necessary to give lawmakers enough time. “We need to avoid a government shutdown, which would be horrendous if that were to occur on October 1,” Collins said, according to remarks provided by her office. “And we also need to avoid having a continuing resolution, by that I mean a stopgap bill that just puts government on automatic pilot for the whole year. “We're going to have to have a short-term continuing resolution, but we're making really good progress with overwhelming bipartisan support, and I hope that will continue.”Another failureCongress is supposed to complete work on the dozen annual appropriations bills before the start of the new fiscal year but has failed to do so for decades. This year is no different. The House and Senate are nowhere near finishing their work on the bills, which provide funding for dozens of departments, including Agriculture, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, State, Transportation and Veterans Affairs.The bills, which make up about one-third of federal spending, also fund smaller agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Science Foundation and the National Weather Service.The House has approved two of the dozen bills — Defense and Military Construction-VA. The Senate has passed its Agriculture, Legislative Branch and Military Construction-VA bills.The House bills have only been supported by GOP lawmakers, while the Senate’s bills are broadly bipartisan, giving that chamber an upper hand if the two chambers begin conferencing full-year bills later this year. Without a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on how much to spend on all of the bills, it’s highly unlikely Congress will be able to complete its work before the Oct. 1 deadline.

Leaders will instead need to reach agreement on a stopgap spending bill that essentially keeps government funding on autopilot until lawmakers can work out a final deal on the full-year bills. The calendar doesn’t give Speaker Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader Thune, R-S.D., much time to find compromise with their Democratic counterparts. Both chambers are in session for three weeks at the beginning of September before breaking for Rosh Hashanah. They’ll return to Capitol Hill on Sept. 29 with less than two days to fund the government or begin a partial shutdown.Thune said in mid-August at the Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce Inside Washington luncheon that he expects lawmakers will “have a big fight at the end of September.”Last shutdown stretched 35 daysIt’s been almost seven years since some federal departments and agencies had to navigate a shutdown, when Congress and the first Trump administration were unable to broker a funding deal before a deadline.A shutdown this year would have substantially more impact than that 35-day debacle since, when that funding lapse began, Congress had approved the Defense, Energy-Water, Labor-HHS-Education, Legislative Branch and Military Construction-VA spending bills.The departments and agencies funded by those laws, including Congress, weren’t affected by the shutdown.Lawmakers have failed to send any of the full-year bills to Trump so far this year, so every department and agency would need to implement a shutdown plan if Congress doesn't approve a stopgap spending bill before Oct. 1.Federal employees who deal with the preservation of life and property as well as national security will likely be deemed exempt and work without pay until the shutdown ends.Workers who are not considered essential to the federal government’s operations would be furloughed until Congress and the president broker some sort of funding deal.Both categories of employees receive back pay once the lapse ends, though that doesn’t extend to federal contractors.On to the stopgapCongress regularly approves a stopgap spending bill in September to gain more time to complete negotiations on the full-year appropriations bills.That continuing resolution, as it’s sometimes called, usually lasts until the last Friday in December when both chambers of Congress are scheduled to be in Washington, D.C.So a September stopgap would likely last until Friday, Dec. 19, assuming the House and Senate can reach an agreement and hold floor votes in the weeks ahead.Last year, in the lead-up to the presidential election, lawmakers approved a stopgap bill in September that funded the government through mid-December.Following the Republican sweep of the November elections, GOP leaders opted not to negotiate the full-year bills and used a second stopgap bill to fund the government until March after a raucous 48 hours on Capitol Hill.Speaker Johnson took a go-it-alone approach on a third stopgap spending bill, leaving Democrats completely out of the negotiations and jamming the Senate with the legislation.Schumer and several Democrats ultimately helped Republicans get past the 60-vote legislative filibuster, but most voted against actually passing the stopgap.The dilemma over forcing a shutdown or helping Republicans pass a stopgap bill will resurface for Schumer in the weeks ahead as he tries to navigate another shutdown deadline amid unified GOP control of Washington.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-09-02 06:57:05.136304

(Courtesy of Boise Pride)This weekend, the Boise Pride Festival will start with some change.
Instead of being in the heart of downtown at Cecil D. Andrus Park, the festivities will be held at Ann Morrison Park — to accommodate the growing crowds that turn out each year. 
As fewer companies sponsored the event, organizers shifted to community fundraising but are still planning a scaled-back fireworks show.
And this year’s theme, “Our Pride, Our Power,” is meant to speak to the cultural and political moment.
These anti-LGBTQ+ bills were introduced in 2025 Idaho legislative session. Where does each stand?

“The legislation that’s occurred in the last year and a half in Idaho has really kind of set people into a more activist mindset, from my personal observation,” Boise Pride Marketing Director Davis Hilton said. “And I think it comes out through that theme. Like we’re still proud of who we are. We’re also very powerful as a community.”
But even with the changes, they say people can still expect the typical Boise Pride experience: A weekend of LGBTQ+ pride festivities, performances, a parade and a fireworks show.
Organizers began hosting Boise Pride in September, rather than during pride month in June, after the COVID pandemic.
This year’s Boise Pride, the 36th annual event, is presented by Albertsons. 
 Boise Pride fundraising for fireworks show amid national decline in corporate sponsorships

As corporate sponsorships dropped this year, Boise Pride is roughly $190,000 short of last year’s sponsorship funds, with $250,000 compared to last year’s $440,000, Hilton told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. 
That didn’t just happen in Idaho, and is a sign of the times, they said. This year, companies across the U.S. ended sponsorships of LGBTQ+ pride events, Axios reported. 
“The openness of the people and the attendance growing signifies there is a lot of public support for our mission. I just think that on the corporate end, there was a disconnect politically this year,” Hilton said.
As a result of less corporate sponsorships, they said Boise Pride scaled down festivities and raised more from local businesses after announcing the drop off. But Boise Pride is still planning its annual fireworks show Saturday night, with the help of community fundraising.
The Bose Pride fireworks fundraiser — which is accepting donations online — is half way toward its $15,000 goal.

 Before Boise Pride Parade, faith groups will lead blessings

At 9 a.m. Sunday, before the Boise Pride parade starts, faith groups will gather in Ann Morrison Park for the third annual Multifaith Pride Worship Service.
At the service’s end, organizers will offer a blessing over the festival and LGBTQ+ people.
Faith drives Idaho legislator to reverse same-sex marriage. These faith leaders push back.

“Unfortunately, many faith communities have often offered curses and cursed the LGBTQ community  because of their religious beliefs. And so we just want to continue to remind people that we have a counter-message and a counter-narrative, and that particularly fundamentalists religious groups do not get to have the only word or only say on what is moral and what is blessable,” said the Rev. Josh Lee, pastor for the Boise First United Church of Christ. 
At the interfaith event, leaders will ask people to write hurtful memories or the names of people who said hurtful things about them onto a piece of dissolvable paper — which they can put into a water basin on an altar to dissolve after. Another ritual planned invites attendees to honor allies, by writing the names of people who cared for and loved them on a large cloth. 
The event will also feature a book reading performed by the former West Ada School District teacher Sarah Inama. The story of a banner in her classroom promoting inclusivity went viral after she refused to remove it upon a request from the school district, Idaho Education News reported.
 What’s on Boise Pride’s schedule? 

Instead of the usual three days of full events, Boise Pride is planned for Saturday and Sunday. 
There are two paid ticketed events at Treefort Music Hall in downtown Boise this year:

8 p.m. Friday: the Boise Pride Launch Party, featuring live performances from artists The Knocks and Dragonette, drag queen Aquaria and local performers.
9 p.m. ATTENTION, a party featuring live DJing by Shea Couleé, performances from local drag and dance performers and Plane Jane, who appeared in RuPaul’s Drag Race.

Boise Pride is scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, Sept. 6-7, at Ann Morrison Park. The full schedule is available online at boisepridefest.org/festival-schedule.
Here’s a brief rundown:
Saturday: 

The festival runs from 11 a.m. to 9:15 p.m.
Performances start at noon with the Starbelly School of Dance, ending with queer pop artist Zolita starting at 8:15 p.m.
The fireworks show caps the day at 9 p.m. 

Sunday:

At 10 a.m., the Boise Pride Parade starts. But since the festival has moved from the heart of downtown, so has the parade route. The parade now starts at the intersection by South 13th Street and River Street, before running through River Street, crossing the Boise River on Ninth Street and ending along Sherwood Street by Ann Morrison Park. Find the parade route online at boisepridefest.org/pride-parade.
Then the festival opens starting at 11 a.m., with performances throughout the day until the festival ends at 5 p.m.

(Photo: Courtesy Altitude Water)A company looking to make clean drinking water more climate-resilient and accessible during disasters found an ideal testing ground in an unlikely place: Amy Grant’s Williamson County farm.
Florida-based Altitude Water began working with the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter in 2014, when she needed a drinking water source to support a youth summer camp on the rural property in a short time frame.
Grant already had one of the company’s smaller machines, which use technology to pull water from the humid atmosphere. In a matter of weeks, Altitude Water installed a large machine capable of producing more than 100 gallons of drinking water each day, enough to have a gallon of water on hand for each camp attendee.
“We got it done,” Altitude Water Founder and COO Jeff Szur said. “Then from that, as the farm kept growing, we needed more water. She allowed us to use the farm to do some research and development.”
Eleven years later, Grant’s Hidden Trace Farm is now fully water independent — generating, purifying and storing up to 800 gallons of water each day with no reliance on city infrastructure, Szur said.

The system is an unassuming cluster of machines and storage tanks tucked under a covered patio. An atmospheric water generator uses evaporation and condensation to turn humidity from the air into water. An ozone generator runs an electrical charge through the air to create ozone gas. That ozone is then used to purify rainwater and water from the sulfur-laden aquifer below ground. Using ozone to purify water is also a time-tested idea first developed in the 1890s in Europe.
Weather at Altitude Water’s South Florida headquarters is often hot and humid, ideal conditions for the atmospheric water generators to produce high water yields. But other areas of the country — and the world — experience greater range. The company needed to test the machines’ limits in cooler, dryer conditions.
“Testing at Amy Grant’s farm gave us the cooler temperatures and conditions we needed to develop the water and purification systems we are now using in disaster zones and rural communities,” Szur said.
Altitude Water’s smallest machine, which is about the size of a 5-gallon water cooler and sells for around $4,000, can produce up to 15 gallons of water each day. The machine will produce about six gallons of water in 74-degree weather with 45% humidity, he said. That drops to three and a half gallons at 35% humidity.
“We can only take the water out that’s in the air,” Szur said. 
Grant’s farm uses a machine that can produce around 185 gallons of water in 24 hours.
While other companies make machines that similarly use evaporation and condensation to produce water from the air – a natural process that Szur says no one can patent – Altitude Water does hold a patent for their ozone injection system.
The “water hub” system first tested at Hidden Trace can now be seen around the world, providing water to off-grid Maka, Cameroon, and helping survivors in Asheville, North Carolina in the months after Hurricane Helene.
“As communities across the U.S. face ground contamination, aging infrastructure, and climate-driven water emergencies, the work we’ve achieved at Hidden Trace Farm has given us a replicable path forward,” Szur said.
Water, power and cell service on wheels
Altitude Water’s Disaster Relief Trailer got one of its first field tests after wildfires scorched Maui in 2023. It was equipped with a machine that could capture up to 390 gallons of water from the air per day, and a 500-gallon storage tank. There was no time to set the trailer up for solar power, Szur said, so it ran off of a diesel generator.
The company’s second trailer — this time, with a solar power option — was put to the test in Asheville after Hurricane Helene. Altitude Water partnered with Grassroots Aid Partnership and Footprint Project, a nonprofit that provides solar power for communities facing crisis, for disaster response efforts. 
The trailer was equipped with machines able to produce 210 gallons of water and purify 1,500 gallons. Solar panels could generate 12 kilowatts an hour and with 60 kilowatts of battery storage that allowed the water purification machine to run at night. The company also installed Starlink satellite technology, providing phone and internet service. 
“It’s basically a command center with everything you need, without having to ship everything in every day,” Szur said. “You don’t have to ship in gas, you don’t have to ship in bottled water, and then you have your communications, which we added because we saw in Maui — with all the towers burned — how bad the logistics were.”
The trailer is compatible with a gas generator and municipal hookups as well, “because you never know when you get into a disaster what the situation is going to be.”
Dave Anderson, executive director of Grassroots Aid Partnership, recounted his organization’s initial recovery efforts in Asheville in a November video posted to social media. Upon setting up their food operation, they discovered there was no water, power, internet or phone service.
“We forget how reliant we are on these things, so when Altitude came in with this trailer, Bamo! We had water, we had internet, and we had power, so that was a great thing to just start off with,” Anderson said.
Flexibility proved helpful in Asheville, where the trailer stayed for a little over three months, Szur said. The weather became cold and dry, significantly reducing the amount of water that could be pulled from the air.
But the trailer’s water purification capabilities and solar power remained useful, he said.
“Being able to purify the water using our ozone purification process was a godsend, and again, it was being able to do the research and development on Amy’s farm that enabled us to do that,” Szur said.
Szur, who studied economics and business at Vanderbilt University, said he and his father entered the water business together after selling their respective restaurant and oil well businesses. 
“We looked at a lot of the industries and thought that water was going to be the next oil,” Szur said. “We’ve spent centuries using water as our dumping ground to all these chemicals and just trying to dilute the chemicals down to a level that’s safe to drink.”
But it’s not just about technology that provides clean water, he said.
“It can not only help people by giving them a resource, but also give them hope,” Szur said.

In a town best known for snow and its mountain backdrops, Joe Waneka has what might seem an odd problem to solve. As director of operations for the Aspen School District, he is tasked, in part, with keeping the 1,600 students enrolled in the district’s elementary, middle and high schools cool enough so that heat does not preclude learning.
That has become more of an issue on the 32-acre campus set amid the rolling terrain where Maroon Creek hurries toward the valley floor. Part of the reason is Colorado’s mid-August return to schools. Summers have been warming, too. And then there is the smoke from wildfires.
Since students returned to classes, temperatures on the hottest days have reached 78 degrees inside the buildings. “That is their tipping point, if you will, when they start thinking more about getting comfortable than teaching or learning,” he said. “By 80 degrees, you are overwhelmed.”

Open the windows at night and let in some fresh mountain air? It helps until past noon. It does not help at all if wildfires have made the air unhealthy. On Aug. 14, the second day of school this year, the district announced it was making KN95 masks available to all who wanted them after nearby wildfires turned local skies hazy. 
The middle school has central air conditioning. The elementary and high schools have 68 portable air-conditioning wall units, all of them noisy and cumbersome. Waneka describes them as Band-Aids. A better solution is needed.
In November, Waneka began investigating potential remedies. Conventional chiller units could be added but would add an extra $100,000 to $125,000 per building in electricity costs. 
By March, Waneka had narrowed his focus to geothermal, to tap the underground for both coolness and heat. This would comport with the school district’s strategic plan, which calls for students and staff to have access to “sustainable energy.” 
Burning natural gas at the three schools and two associated buildings and the use of snowmelt systems produce 235,000 therms of energy heat annually, according to a report by The GreyEdge Group, a Utah-based consultant that specializes in geothermal energy networks. Greenhouse gas emissions produced are comparable to burning almost seven railcars of coal, according to an Environmental Protection Agency calculator.
Two grants have assisted the school district in exploring the feasibility of creating a well field and retrofitting the buildings. In June, the Colorado Energy Office announced a grant of $78,400, one of five dozen geothermal grants distributed across Colorado in a $12 million program approved by state legislators in 2023. More recently, the Community Office for Resource Efficiency awarded the district a $50,000 grant.
Even before receiving the grants, the school district hired The GreyEdge Group to evaluate a geothermal ambient temperature loop. The report delivered by the company in June estimated that a loop system could reduce annual heating-related emissions 92%.

A test bore may yet be drilled this fall. The drilling would take three days. Cost is estimated at roughly $75,000. Three potential locations on the campus have been established. Test bores — a requirement of the state grant — provide information about soil composition and underground thermal characteristics. This informs decisions about design of the full well field. Scores of closely spaced wells would probably be needed.
If successful, this thermal energy network would provide heat and cooling for up to 600,000 square feet. That includes the schools and other buildings, along with 30,000 square feet of future buildings and 157,000 square feet of athletic fields and the track. 
This technology has been deployed with great success elsewhere in Colorado and other states, and many more systems are planned.
Three miles from the schools, two test bores have already been drilled for what is being called Aspen Airport Business Center Thermal Energy Network. Aided by a $250,000 grant from the Colorado Energy Office, Pitkin County is exploring how to integrate a microgrid with a heating district to reduce energy loads at the airport as well as the Pitkin County Public Works and Roaring Fork Transportation Authority facilities.
At his office in the basement of Aspen High School, Waneka said he was not content to go with easier off-the-shelf solutions to the cooling needs at the schools. Exploring options might produce a truly sustainable energy system and reduce fuel costs. “To me, it is foolish not to explore,” he said.
A mature technology
Geothermal systems exploit the relatively constant temperatures found underground. Geo-exchange, one of several geothermal technologies, uses electric pumps to extract that heat or coolness as needed in the buildings. The process is similar to that used by refrigerators.
Many schools across Colorado already use geo-exchange technology, as does the governor’s mansion in Denver and the state Capitol.
The Poudre School District first used geo-exchange in 2002 at an operations building in Fort Collins. It used the same technology in a school in 2004 and again recently at three new schools in Loveland, in Timnath and in Wellington.
Grand Junction has Colorado’s most prominent use of geothermal. Officials at Colorado Mesa University in 2008 pulled the trigger on a geo-exchange system that now provides heating and cooling for 1.2 million square feet of space contained within 16 campus buildings. The success has drawn national attention. 
University officials say the geo-exchange pipes under soccer fields and other open spaces on the campus coupled with other cost-savings measures and efficiencies enable them to save $1.5 million annually in utility costs. This, they say, allows Colorado Mesa to charge the third-lowest combined tuition and fee rate among Colorado’s 12 public colleges and universities.

A thermal energy network connects multiple buildings through a common geo-exchange system. Pagosa Springs has had such a system for 33 customers in its downtown buildings since 1982. Of course, it has hot springs nearby. 
No need for hot springs, though. Ground temperatures everywhere rise the lower you go. In Colorado, wells for geo-exchange most commonly are sunk 300 to 500 feet.
Standard geo-exchange systems rely solely on pushing heat into and pulling heat from Earth as needed. The energy between the ground and the surface is transferred via recycling water. 
At the campus, something more complex than a simple push-and-pull of underground energy from the underground is being investigated. Aspen’s climate is part of the story. 
Winters in Aspen, at 8,000 feet, last longer and more heat is commonly needed than in Denver or Grand Junction. Given these longer winters and greater heating needs, might a potential thermal energy network on the Aspen schools campus also draw energy from other sources in the area?
For example, can exhaust heat produced in making ice at the nearby Aspen Recreation Center be sequestered in the geothermal well field? Similarly, a sewer pipeline runs relatively proximate to the schools campus. Might the heat be extracted for use in the campus network? GreyEdge examined various alternatives in its June report.
These ideas are not novel. For example, in Denver, heat is drawn from a 72-inch pipeline that transports sewage from downtown to a treatment plant. The extracted heat provides 90% of what is needed for buildings on the 250-acre campus of the National Western Complex, site of the annual stock show.
In Vail, the town government has been working on a smaller-scale application of the same concept, using heat from sewage to melt snow at Lionshead Village, which sits at the base of Vail Mountain.
Holy Cross Energy, the electrical provider for Vail and parts of Aspen, including the schools campus, hopes to see thermal energy networks succeed. It expects to deliver 80% emissions free electricity in 2025. For 2030, it has a goal of 100%. To achieve that ambitious goal, it needs to figure out ways to lower peak demand and improve overall efficiency. The utility sees geothermal energy networks as part of that strategy.
“At times of oversupply, the excess electricity would power a boiler or a chiller, raising or lowering the water temperature in the thermal loop,” Holy Cross Energy CEO Bryan Hannegan wrote in an email.
“This reduces the need for electricity use later by the building’s heat pump,” Hannegan added. “The net effect is to consume excess electricity, store it, and then use it to reduce future electricity demand — basically a thermal version of battery storage. This helps us match our electricity demand to our electricity supply in a more cost-effective way.”
Lauren Suhrbier, who is with Carbondale-based Clean Energy Economy for the Region, describes the work at the schools campus as being in an early stage of investigation. CLEER, which has been developing expertise in geothermal since 2023, has taken on the role of project manager for the Aspen schools’ geothermal exploration and has been paid $10,000 by the school district as of mid-August.
Suhrbier said the district hopes the geo-exchange network can be accomplished for less than $20 million. One possibility is to transfer the risk to an outside financier through an energy performance contract. There is a high probability that this could be part of a future bond election, said Waneka.

A bigger, deeper idea
Another idea involving the campus has even more ambition. This idea — presented to the school district by GreyEdge — would be to drill deep to create a reservoir of energy thousands of feet below the surface and under an impervious layer of rock. Energy in the form of pressure could be stored and then tapped to produce electricity.
Long-duration storage will be crucial for the decarbonization of electricity by all electrical utilities. Existing battery technologies come up short. Pumped-storage hydro, an old technology, has been used near Georgetown and in reservoirs near Leadville for decades. Water from a higher reservoir is released as needed to produce electricity then pumped back to the upper reservoir when electricity is plentiful. Several more such pumped-storage ideas are being pursued along the Yampa River west of Steamboat Springs.
GreyEdge has partnered with two other companies — Pure-Green Colorado and Sage Geosystems — to propose a 8,000- to 10,000-foot well at the Aspen campus. Excess renewable energy could be stored in that underground reservoir.
This reservoir might be compared to a balloon. The rock at that depth would be fractured to create a place where energy can be stored under pressure. Just as air is exhaled into a balloon and then released, energy could be stored in this underground balloon then released to generate electricity.
GreyEdge estimates a potential capacity for 5 megawatts of generation. That’s about the same capacity as the 35-acre solar farm that opened in 2021 near Woody Creek. The difference is that the solar farm produces electricity only when the sun is shining. The underground reservoir would produce electricity at crucial times as well as provide heat as needed for the school district campus.
Drilling deep holes is a surmountable challenge, as oil and gas drillers in the Piceance Basin, north of Rifle, have routinely drilled wells 8,000 to 10,000 feet deep. 
But does a geologic lid exist to prevent energy from escaping that “balloon”? GreyEdge has assembled geological reports that suggest that such a lid exists in the area of the Aspen campus. 
GreyEdge believes that this idea of underground storage has been deployed only in Iceland.
The idea was delivered to the Aspen School District, but no formal discussion has been held nor commitments made. It is, at this point, just an idea.
Cost matters
Cost matters everywhere. In new buildings, the greater cost of geothermal as compared to conventional heating and cooling is negligible, according to study for a new public building in Fort Collins.
Retrofitting buildings, however, always costs more. The question is how much in utility bills projects recoup and how quickly. In Fort Collins, utility costs for that first school building with geothermal declined 50% in the first decade. However, Aaron Tilden, of Millig Design Build, said that retrofits commonly need grants to pencil out in less than a 20- to 25-year time frame.
Grants were crucial to the decision by school board members at Liberty School District J-4, which has 78 students and is located amid farms and ranches 130 miles east of Denver. The school board members were aware that the geo-exchange system would reduce emissions, but that was not the motivation.
In Fort Collins, though, Poudre School District has energy goals of being good community stewards and protective of natural resources while being fiscally prudent. “The two go hand in hand,” Trudy Trimbath, the district’s energy and sustainability manager, said of the geo-exchange systems.
Eagle County needed to replace a natural gas system but also has a goal of setting an example with its $14.5 million geo-exchange system now being installed at the county courthouse campus in Eagle. The network of 66 wells will provide heat and cooling for 75,657 square feet for three buildings beginning in October. 
County officials say they can justify the expense not only in cost savings over time but in the external costs. Eagle County Commissioner Matt Scherr said the existing natural-gas-burning system needed to be replaced but part of the calculation was recognition of the need to reduce greenhouse gases.
As for the Aspen School District, results of the test bore will inform whether any ideas around geothermal become a formal proposal. If the results are favorable, it’s possible that a project could get underway in 2027.

“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
Nonmedical exemptions
Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.











We are endangering each other.


– Dr. Rana Alissa, Jacksonville, Fla., pediatrician and president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics



Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
Other vaccines
Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.
Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
‘Normalization’ of outbreaks
During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.
“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

(Photo: Getty Images)n April 2024, I urged TennCare and the Tennessee Legislature to take obesity seriously. TennCare’s recent commitment to expanding coverage for obesity medications isn’t just a policy update: it is a lifeline for thousands of Tennesseans and a rare opportunity for our state to lead the nation in treating one of its most urgent health crises. 
I’ve struggled with obesity my entire life. I know the health challenges it brings, the stigma that comes with weight, the unsolicited comments from strangers, the scoldings from doctors who dismiss the complexity of this disease with “eat less and walk more” and the gimmick solutions advertised on TV. I’ve fought for my own care for as long as I can remember.  
As a past chair of the Obesity Action Coalition (OAC) and proud Tennessean, I’ve spent more than a decade working alongside advocates, clinicians, and policymakers to recognize obesity as a chronic disease and change the way it is covered by insurance. This decision is a victory for Tennesseans living with obesity.  
Obesity affects more than 40% of adults in the U.S., yet far too often, treatment access depends on where you live or what insurance you have. At a time when several states are moving to cut their state’s coverage or have chosen to cut back Medicaid coverage for obesity care, Tennessee is expanding this critical coverage for obesity medications. There is overwhelming evidence that comprehensive treatment of obesity improves health outcomes and reduces long-term health care costs. Now, more people affected by the disease can access medications along with nutritional counseling, behavioral therapy, and surgery.
Tennessee Legislature can aid state’s obesity problem

By expanding access to FDA-approved obesity medications for Medicaid enrollees, TennCare’s actions clearly signal that we believe people living with obesity deserve evidence-based care, not judgment or denial. Obesity is a disease, one that deserves treatment – just like diabetes, heart disease or cancer. 
This is more than a win for Tennesseans; it’s a demonstration that state-level action can drive change even when federal policy progress is stagnant. Other states should examine Tennessee’s decision closely and ask: Why not us? To improve public health, reduce chronic disease, and create a more equitable healthcare system, expanding access to obesity care must be part of the solution.
Coverage decisions like this also help dismantle the stigma surrounding obesity and send the message that we know obesity is more than willpower, but a complex interplay of biology, environment, and genetics.
This change didn’t happen overnight. It’s the result of persistent advocacy from people living with obesity, healthcare providers, and nonprofit organizations like OAC. 
TennCare’s action is a victory for patients and for the idea that every person deserves access to the care they need, and it should be just the beginning.

All but one person in attendance shared concerns about the proposed project. (Photo by Caity Coyne/West Virginia Watch)WHARNCLIFFE, W.Va. — When Sheila Miller sat down at a picnic table at Wharncliffe Park last Thursday, she was armed with a notebook, a pen and numerous questions.
She wanted to know what the environmental and health ramifications would be for two off-grid methane power plants, a data center and an ammonia plant that are proposed to be constructed at the old Twisted Gun Golf Course a few miles from her home.
“I don’t know much about this at all and that worries me,” Miller said. “I like my peace and quiet and now I’m hearing this could really change things. I would have liked to be more informed by the government or the company or whoever else should have informed us so I could know what those changes would be.”
The proposed development — called the Adams Fork Energy project — comes from TransGas and would create the largest natural gas-fueled ammonia plant in the world. The two power plants onsite — which would operate as “microgrids” — would power two new data centers: one at the golf course in Wharncliffe and another near the Mingo-Logan county line at the Harless Industrial Park.
Currently, the state Department of Environmental Protection is reviewing air quality permit applications from TransGas for the development of the two off-grid power plants. The permit to construct the ammonia plant is already in place.
On Thursday, Miller was one of about 50 residents from Mingo and Logan counties who attended an unofficial community meeting to learn more about the proposed projects. Tyler Cannon, the Climate Alliance Coordinator with West Virginia Citizen Action Group, led the meeting, which was casual and mostly based on group discussion as well as questions and answers.
Cannon, a Logan County native, answered what he could. But several of the residents’ most pressing concerns couldn’t be addressed because of redactions made in the air quality permit applications filed with the DEP.
“It’s possible there are some things in there that could help us understand more about how [these facilities] will be built and what their actual environmental impact will be, but if that does exist, it’s redacted,” Cannon told community members. “They are saying these are proprietary secrets, meaning we the public aren’t allowed to know.”
The redactions in the air quality permits aren’t unusual. In Tucker County, where a different company is attempting to construct a natural gas power plant to provide electricity for another data center, a heavily redacted air quality permit — now approved by the DEP — has left hundreds of residents with similar concerns.
There, residents only found out about the proposed project — which would be a massive complex when completed — when someone saw a public notice posted in a local newspaper. The community started organizing to find out more information. Despite these efforts and an outpour of public comments against the development, they couldn’t learn much more and the DEP ended up approving Fundamental Data’s request.
For Miller and other residents who spoke at Thursday’s meeting, the lack of public outreach in the coalfields — as in Tucker County — felt intentional.
“It’s not surprising, I suppose, that they didn’t tell us,” Miller said. “It does feel like it was on purpose. Like they didn’t tell us more so we couldn’t do anything about it. Although it probably wouldn’t matter; [the people in power] are always going to let these corporations walk all over us down here.”
Gilbert resident Pam Surber said she’s spent the last few months talking to people in the community whenever possible about the proposed project. When she goes to the store or stops by the gas station, she brings it up to cashiers or others in line. Rarely, she said, is someone aware of what she’s talking about.
“I can’t tell you how many people have not heard a word about this,” Surber said. “They don’t know what’s about to happen and they don’t know how it could hurt them.”

‘We’ve had enough devastation’
At 79 years old, Miller has lived by Left Fork Bens Creek, in Mingo County, her entire life. Life there has been pleasant, she said. She knows all of her neighbors — she watched several of them grow up — and loves living so close to nature. 
But through her decades living in the region, she’s already seen the environment and landscape around her change drastically. She’s seen and experienced firsthand the consequences that can come from living so close to extractive industries.
“Our health, our environmental health, is already real bad down here,” Miller said. “We’ve had enough devastation from coal mining, from strip mining, from logging, from fracking. Our people are already sick. We don’t see the birds or the animals here like we used to.”
According to the air quality permit applications, the facilities would have the capacity to produce more than 2,400 megawatts each. If approved, the two TransGas facilities would be the third- and fourth-highest power-intensive industrial sites in the state, behind the John Amos Power Plant in Putnam County and the Harrison Power Station in Harrison County.
Each facility would house 117 engines powered by natural gas, with 114 of those running full-time. If no gas is available, the engines would run on diesel that is stored in 40 tanks on site. 
Annually, per the applications, each facility would have the potential to emit up to 206 tons of carbon monoxide, 194 tons of nitrogen oxides, 118 tons of volatile organic compounds and 188 tons of fine particulate matter, or soot.
These kinds of emissions are known to negatively affect air quality in surrounding areas and contribute to climate change. People at risk of developing respiratory problems — including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, black lung or other illnesses — are particularly vulnerable to negative health impacts from emissions.
Residents at Thursday’s meeting were particularly concerned about the impact of air pollution. Already, the state’s southern coalfields suffer from some of the highest rates of black lung disease due to the concentration of coal miners.
During the meeting, Wilma Steele asked those in attendance to raise their hands if they knew someone who was living with black lung. Almost 40 hands immediately rose.
“We all know folks who are already sick, with COPD, with black lung, with cancer,” someone in the crowd said. “Why would we want something that can hurt us even more?”
Cannon said the new power generation is almost certainly going to have negative health and environmental impacts. What’s frustrating, he said, is the inability to know how bad it actually could be because of the lack of information.
TransGas alleges that the facilities will have technology allowing them to sequester more than 99% of the carbon emissions produced. But the permit filed with the DEP doesn’t specify how.
“Technically speaking, that’s impossible,” Cannon said. “No other [facility] anywhere has been able to do that, and because of the redactions we can’t really see how they plan to be different.”
Only one person in attendance on Thursday, Ernie Sammons, spoke in support of the Adams Fork Energy project. He told residents that he is strongly in support of the proposed projects because the area needs more jobs. Other places across the world, he alleged, are already undertaking similar kinds of developments. The environmental concerns, he continued, are largely overblown.
But — as pointed out by residents in the meeting — Sammons stands to personally benefit from the development. He said he owns the land for the Twisted Gun Golf Course in Wharncliffe and is the one selling it to TransGas for the development.
“But even if I didn’t stand to benefit financially here,” Sammons said, “I would support this.”
Per TransGas, a majority of the jobs created by the proposed development — about 5,000 — would be in construction, meaning they’d be temporary and would not necessarily be taken by locals. Once up and running, TransGas says 300 people would be hired to work on a “day-to-day basis.”
Surber, however, remains doubtful. Even if jobs were created, she told Sammons, she’s not sure the cost to the environment and residents would be worth the alleged gain.
“Are you comfortable with a child breathing this air? With anyone who is sick, who could become sick?” Surber asked. “All the money, all the jobs in the world are not worth the health of my family, of my neighbors, of my community. We can’t afford that.”

Residents struggle for clean water as TransGas requests access to underground source
Power plants and data centers need a lot of water to function, Cannon said. Some data centers can use up to 5 million gallons of drinking water a day. The consequences of this water usage are becoming clearer as communities across the country that are located next to new data center developments have been tapped dry or had their water contaminated.
Oftentimes, these new developments will tap into municipal water sources. As proposed in Mingo County, however, TransGas plans to tap into mine pools located underneath the golf course.
But while the source of the water is different — Mingo County Public Service District pulls most of its drinking water from the Tug Fork River — residents are frustrated.
Until several years ago, Miller and most of the residents in Wharnscliffe relied on private wells for their drinking water. Miller had two. But, likely due to mining activity in the vicinity, one ran dry and the foundation in the other cracked, leading to contamination underground. Others in the region experienced the same.
“When we have water, I don’t trust what comes out,” Miller said. “You never know what’s in there. Sometimes it has an odor to it. There are breaks and things that happen that we’re not told about. It’s really frustrating, and it’s scary.”
Now hooked up to the Mingo County PSD, water service outages are the norm.
Last winter, Miller said her water was out for days and sometimes weeks at a time. She would drive to a friend’s house in Gilbert to shower, do laundry and more.
Several residents at Thursday’s meeting said they’ve contacted the Mingo County Commission about tapping into the underground mine water to service their community in order to avoid these outages.
They haven’t heard any progress on that front, they said last week.
But now, that water — which will have to be treated to remove minerals and potential contaminants before being used by the data centers and in the power plants, the same process that would be used for drinking water — will be committed to TransGas under its current applications.
Cannon said the company will have “no cap” on the water it is allowed to pull from the mine shafts.
“They can pump as much from these water tables as they want,” Cannon said. “None of that will go to residents.”
This was especially upsetting to community members.
“Everyone, how many of you have had your water destroyed in Mingo County, ever?” Steele asked those in attendance on Thursday.
Every hand under the camping shelter shot up.
“Water failure and access to clean water has been a longstanding issue in Mingo County,” Cannon said. “Now, it’s like they want to hand this potential fresh water resource to this private company to have unlimited access to the water table when residents don’t have access to clean water in their home themselves. How does that serve the people who live here?”
Surber said she’s used to seeing industry exploit the resources and people in West Virginia’s southern coalfields. 
It’s been the norm for the people living there since the coal industry was booming. Every few years since then, political leaders come in claiming to have a new industry or sector that will revive the struggling region.
But that revival has never happened. Logging hasn’t addressed the region’s struggles, nor has manufacturing or fracking or strip mining. Tourism has yet to revive the economy. 
Surber, Steele and numerous other residents present Thursday said they doubt that data centers will be the silver bullet those in charge claim they’ll be for their communities.
“There is nothing that I can see about these data centers that will be good,” Surber said. “The people who want to do this aren’t speaking to us, too much is being kept hush-hush and we don’t know what’s at risk because they won’t tell us. None of this is worth it.”
The DEP has extended the public comment period for TransGas’ two air quality permits until 5 p.m. on Sept. 19. A final in-person public meeting will be held by the DEP between 4:30 p.m. and 8 p.m. on Sept. 18 at the Harless Center in Gilbert.

(Getty Images)At the urging of Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump has renewed his attacks on mail-in voting threatening an executive order banning the practice. 
The president does not have the constitutional authority to carry out this threat. Elections are under the authority of the states.  
Eliminating mail-in voting in Idaho would disenfranchise many qualified voters, including those living in rural or remote areas who do not have access to in-person voting. Idaho has 11 such precincts that are mail-in voting only. 
Others who rely on this voting service are military personnel and their families as well as those who are traveling, conducting out-of-state religious service, or those caring for others. 
Changing Idaho law, the only way to eliminate mail-in voting, would also impact those without transportation or the flexibility to leave work, and citizens with disabilities. Other voters want to take time with their ballot, studying candidates and the issues. Absentee balloting facilitates more informed voting choices.
With 34 other countries using some form of mail-in voting, the U.S. is not alone.
With over 914K ballots cast, Idaho broke voting records in 2024 general election, initial data show

A Republican president attacking mail-in voting now is reacting to sentiments of his party disavowed in the 2024 general election. In that election, the national Republican Party embraced the practice, pumping $16 million dollars into mail voting promotions targeting low propensity voters. The effort paid big dividends. Republicans outpaced Democrats in mail-in voting in some key states.
 In Pennsylvania alone, GOP voters increased their share of mail-in ballots from 25% in 2020 to 32% in 2024. It is not a coincidence that the 2020 and 2024 elections have had the highest voter turnout since 1908 at 66% and 64% respectively. During these elections, mail voting hit its highest levels with 43% during the pandemic and 30% when it was actively encouraged. 
Eight states including Utah, Oregon and Washington allow all elections conducted by mail. Other states allow some small elections to be conducted by mail-in ballots. 
Idahoans have been able to vote by mail through no-excuse absentee balloting since 1970. Since 2021, this previously uncontroversial provision has seen three attempts by legislators to either eliminate it or restrict it under the pretense of election integrity. Each time they have claimed that absentee balloting was only intended for special cases.
 The intent of the governing statute 34-1001, is clear: “Any registered elector of the state of Idaho may vote in any election by absentee ballot.” Additionally, Idahoans have been told repeatedly by successive secretaries of state that Idaho has free, fair and secure elections. There are multiple layers of security provided for in the absentee balloting process to make sure only those eligible to vote do so.  
Research has shown over time that increasing voting options, including mail-in voting, increases voter turnout. With Idaho at an average of 54% voter turnout in general elections since 1980 and a meager 21% in primary elections when most races are decided, it would bode poorly for Idaho if this option where eliminated or restricted.
Idahoans who are eligible to vote should be encouraged to exercise their constitutional right to vote in all elections. Voting options enable citizens to participate in our democracy and makes us stronger as a state and as a nation. The struggle for voting rights has been ongoing since the founding of this nation. The League of Women Voters advocates for empowering voters. We the people are responsible for protecting mail-in voting.

Many of the canceled federal contracts that have contributed to job losses in the state involved flooding control. (Photo courtesy of Petersburg Fire Rescue & Emergency Services)Virginia and New Jersey may be among the states most affected by the hiring slowdown that enraged President Donald Trump when it appeared in an Aug. 1 jobs report showing the United States had 258,000 fewer jobs than initially reported in May and June.
Such revisions to earlier reports are based on more up-to-date payroll data and are routine. But the scale in this case was shocking — showing the smallest monthly job gains since pandemic-era December 2020 and the largest jobs revision, outside recessions, since 1968.
In response, Trump declared the numbers were wrong, fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief, and offered as a replacement E.J. Antoni, a loyalist who has proposed suspending the jobs report. Trump falsely said in a Truth Social post that the revised jobs numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Beyond those attention-grabbing actions, though, the numbers demonstrate the real effects of Trump’s work slashing the federal government.
A Stateline analysis of the data shows how several states, especially Virginia and New Jersey, shed jobs in the second quarter of this year, which includes May and June.
In Virginia, there were job losses blamed on canceled federal contracts in Northern Virginia as part of cuts made by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE. Meanwhile, a slow housing market shuttered a plywood factory in the southern part of the state, and DOGE efforts canceled flooding control contracts on the coast.
Jay Ford, Virginia policy manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, told a state legislative committee in June that $50 million in contracts were slashed in the Hampton Roads area near the coast, causing a spike in unemployment claims.
That included $20 million to address flooding in Hampton, where almost a quarter of homes are in flood zones, and $24 million to repair a Portsmouth dam that could fail in a major storm, he said.
“This is work that you desperately needed,” Ford said at the committee hearing. “There was a real focus on certain buzzwords like ‘climate’ or ‘resilience,’ and I think people conflated some of these projects as somehow unnecessary.”
For instance, the American Institutes for Research announced 233 layoffs in Virginia in May and 50 in Maryland since the beginning of the year. The not-for-profit organization’s projects include working with school districts to solve achievement gaps and absenteeism, creating AI-driven workforce training, and addressing health care issues such as improving kidney disease care while reducing Medicare costs and strengthening access to health care by keeping rural hospitals open.
“The changes occurring in the federal government have brought significant challenges for many federal contractors, including AIR,” said Dana Tofig, the company’s spokesperson.
Midwest farm economies suffered while some Sun Belt states kept rolling in early 2025

Other recent layoffs in Virginia: 442 workers at Northern Virginia’s Mitre, which manages federally funded defense research centers and faced $28 million in canceled federal contracts; and 554 workers at a shuttered plywood factory in Southern Virginia.
“Housing affordability challenges and a 30-year low in existing home sales are impacting our plywood business, as many of our plywood products are used in repair and remodel projects, which often occur when homes change ownership,” Georgia-Pacific said in a May news release.
Stateline looked at two state jobs surveys for the second quarter that sometimes have quite different results: the so-called payroll survey of businesses that the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses for its monthly report, which has yet to be revised at the state level, and the BLS Local Area Unemployment Statistics program, which estimates job changes based on monthly household surveys.
The LAUS estimates are often called the “household” survey because they rely mostly on surveys of households, asking how many people are employed. They include jobs the payroll survey can’t get, such as contract and agricultural jobs, and capture jobs where people live rather than states where employers are located.
In a state like Virginia with a high number of federal employees and contract workers, lost jobs may show up sooner in the household survey since many federal jobs are not reflected on state-level payrolls if they are done by subcontractors, if the agency or contractor is based in another state, or if DOGE cuts allowed people to stop work but stay on the payroll until September. Those people might report being unemployed in the household survey but wouldn’t show up in other surveys until October.
The household survey shows about the same number of slowing job gains as the revised national payroll report, so it may be a window into the trends, many caused by Trump administration cuts in government, health care and foreign aid, and also by slowing sales in stores and housing markets.
Both surveys rely on small samples and are often revised later, said Charles Gascon, an economist and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The more definitive Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, set for release Dec. 3 for the second quarter, will show state patterns more conclusively, he said.
The household surveys show Virginia with the largest job losses in the country for the second quarter, down about 43,000, and job losses every month since February. Before that, the state gained jobs every month since the height of pandemic job losses in April 2020.
New Jersey, which had the most job losses — 15,400 — in the separate second-quarter payroll survey, has suffered layoffs in retail stores hit by a slowdown in consumer spending, increased shoplifting and, among drugstores, lawsuits for their role in the opioid epidemic.
Walmart announced 481 layoffs at its Hoboken, New Jersey, corporate office, and Rite Aid drugstores laid off 1,122 amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy affected by opioid crisis lawsuits that also hit Walmart and other pharmacy chains. Pharma firms Bristol Myers Squibb and Novartis also have announced hundreds of layoffs in New Jersey, citing patent expirations on popular drugs.
Wobbly state finances
Rising unemployment combined with weak revenue growth suggests “economic fragility” for state finances, said Lucy Dadayan, a principal research associate for the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center who tracks state tax revenue.
Nationally, unemployment was at 4.2% in July, the same as July 2024 but up from recent lows of 3.4% in April 2023, with the largest increases in Mississippi, Virginia and Oregon.
Unemployment has dropped the most compared with July 2024 in Indiana, Illinois, New York and West Virginia.
The states with the highest unemployment rates in July were California (5.5%), Nevada (5.4%) and Michigan (5.3%), while the lowest were in South Dakota (1.9%), North Dakota (2.5%) and Vermont (2.6%).
“I think the dramatic May and June jobs revision signals economic fragility. State-level warning signs suggest the impacts will show gradually,” Dadayan said. “And of course states are facing fiscal challenges caused by One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending decisions.”
State finances are a mixed picture, with income tax collections rising because of a strong stock market and sales tax growth weak as consumers retreat on spending, Dadayan said.

In Virginia, the economically distressed area around Emporia will suffer aftershocks from the plywood plant closing, said Del. Otto Wachsmann, a Republican who represents the area in the state House of Delegates. The area is already reeling from the indefinite closure of a nearby Boar’s Head lunch meat plant that employed 600 people after a listeria outbreak there last year.
The community, part of the southern “Wood Basket” region, has a large logging industry that will now struggle to find new markets farther away with higher costs for trucking, Wachsmann said. “We’re working hard to find new industries to come here.”
Layoff rates in April, as calculated by the online human resources platform Techr, showed New Jersey, Vermont and Virginia with the highest rates.
Amanda Goodall, a workforce analyst who calls herself “The Job Chick” on social media, said the layoffs reflect restructuring in major corporations as well as federal cutbacks. She wrote about the layoff rates in a recent post.
“These are not statistical flukes. They reflect real corporate moves, in New Jersey and Virginia especially,” Goodall wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline. “The bigger issue is that nobody on the ground cares what the unemployment rate says if they can’t find an interview for a job they’re qualified for. State layoff figures are giving us an early read.”
California and Texas
California and Texas saw the biggest jobs gains in both surveys in the second quarter.
Texas added 42,700 jobs in the payroll survey, with the largest increase coming in the category of private educational services, 14,400 jobs, as the state approved a plan for school vouchers to start next year, according to a statement to Stateline from the Texas Workforce Commission.
California added 25,300 jobs. But the household survey showed an increase of almost 111,000 jobs, the highest in the country.
A Public Policy Institute of California blog post in July called the state’s labor market “at best, in a hold-steady pattern this year,” citing the state’s stubbornly elevated unemployment rate of 5.4% but also its jobs improvement over last year.
“A hold-steady pattern is a welcome change from a year ago,” said the post, written by Sarah Bohn, a senior fellow at the institute.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota health officials, health care providers and the public are waiting for details on how the state will implement changes to its Medicaid programs, but federal guidance may not be handed out until 2026.
Without that guidance, the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services and health care providers won’t be able to calculate potential administrative costs forced by the changes, or have a clearer picture on how to implement new processes, said Sarah Aker, executive director of medical services for the state Department of Health and Human Services.
The new requirements will affect about 23,000 of the more than 108,000 Medicaid recipients in the state who are part of the Medicaid expansion program.
Aker said the department knows communicating the changes in the program will be important for patients and providers. 
She said the department is planning a public information campaign, but that needs to wait until detailed guidance on the program is released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Aker added that receiving those specifics before 2026 would be “very optimistic.”
Coverage exemptions, new work requirements and semiannual eligibility check-ins were part of the federal budget reconciliation package signed into law by President Donald Trump in July that will change the Medicaid program.
“We don’t know exactly how the federal government is going to require us to document that exemption,” Aker said. “Until we know more, we don’t want to speculate about exactly what that will look like.”
The state is hopeful the department will be able to use as much existing reporting infrastructure as possible to make submitting documents less burdensome, she said. 
Aker said the department will also try to automate some enrollment processes for efficiency.
Tim Blasl, president of the North Dakota Hospital Association, said he thinks it is too early to determine how the changes will affect Medicaid coverage or attach a dollar amount to the overall cost of the changes.
Officials predict only 5% of North Dakota Medicaid recipients will be impacted by program changes

He said the association is concerned that when people lose health care coverage they won’t complete annual check-ups or use preventative care services, which could lead to longer-term chronic conditions. 
“If you don’t have coverage, that one person if it’s not detected early, it’s detected later, that becomes chronic and probably the health care cost goes up because of that,” Blasl said.
He added that increased expense could lead to higher costs across the health care system for all patients.
Blasl said the hospital association will be monitoring the new eligibility and work requirements closely because, if people lose coverage, health care providers could also see an increase in charity care cases and patient medical debt.
“If people lose coverage, they are always going to be able to access health care, but those individuals now become uninsured and then who covers the cost of that service?” Blasl said. “Typically, it’s probably going to turn into bad debt.”
Shannon Bacon, director of external affairs for the Community HealthCare Association of the Dakotas, said rural health care facilities sometimes rely on Medicaid reimbursements to make ends meet.
“Medicaid really helps sustain access to care for other people, too, who maybe aren’t even on Medicaid,” Bacon said. “It makes it possible to sustain a rural health care facility in their community, so that’s something we’re really paying attention to, that sustainability piece.”
One element of the Medicaid program changes that has received a lot of news coverage are the provider tax provisions included the Republican megabill, Aker said.
Provider taxes are a regulated tax arrangement that states can levy on health care organizations, including hospitals and health systems, nursing facilities, and managed care organizations, to pay for their portion of the Medicaid program, according to the American Hospital Association. 
However, Aker said those taxes will not affect North Dakota rural hospitals and clinics in the same way as other states because North Dakota does not use that tax as a major funding source. North Dakota uses one provider tax for intermediate care facilities that raises about $32 million per year for the program, which represents less than 1% of the HHS budget.
“We won’t be able to do any new provider taxes, but we’re not in the position where we need to reduce provider taxes and come up with new state funding,” she said.
No one knows whether Trump’s $50B for rural health will be enough

North Dakota will also receive about $100 million per year for the next five years as part of the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program that was included in the new law to offset provider tax losses in other states. Aker said applications for those rural hospital grants are due by the end of the year.
“I really feel that this is going to be pretty transformational for our state,” she said. Aker added grants could be awarded for prevention and management of chronic diseases, investments in medical technology, recruiting and retaining workforce in rural areas, access to behavioral health services and right-sizing community health care systems.
Blasl said he believes rural health care facilities may see a fair amount of that extra funding to offset any potential losses due to the program changes.
“The operating margins in the rural areas are a little lower than what they are in the urban areas,” he said. “That’s a concern because if they are in the red already and now we see less people with coverage, they are going to be more in the red and can they survive? But you could say that for an urban hospital as well.”
Sen. Judy Lee, R-West Fargo, has served on the Senate Human Services Committee since coming into the Legislature in 1995, including serving as chair for the last 24 years. 
Lee said there are always unintended consequences when changes are made to programs, which means it’s important to listen to concerns of the affected groups. 
Medicaid expansion was a lifeline for rural hospitals that were able to remain open because it paid facilities for care that may not have been originally covered, she said.
Lee said North Dakota has 37 critical access hospitals serving rural areas of the state that could be impacted by even small changes.
She also stressed that people should get more information about how the Medicaid program is run in North Dakota before jumping to conclusions.
“You are always scared of things you don’t know,” Lee said. “We need to just not get all bent out of shape until we find out what it really is. And as I’ve learned a tiny bit more … I have fewer apprehensions about it.”

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)LSU is not documenting feedback from student athletes in most of its athletic programs, including football, raising concerns about the university’s compliance with NCAA rules. 
In a public records request, the Louisiana Illuminator and Tiger Rag asked for five years of player exit interviews, which all NCAA Division I schools are required to conduct with a sampling of athletes every year at the time they graduate or their eligibility expires. 
The interviews are intended to give athletes an opportunity to provide critical feedback on their school’s sports programs. But for most teams, LSU did not document a single interview during the five-year period. 
LSU athletics spokesman Zach Greenwell said the university is complying with the NCAA’s exit interview bylaw, but the interviews aren’t always documented – which the NCAA does not require. 
The NCAA gives schools immense latitude on how to conduct the interviews and what questions to ask. Its rules don’t require that the questions are asked in person, allowing some schools to provide students with an online form. The NCAA did not respond to a request for comment asking whether there are penalties for institutions that don’t comply or what value the bylaw holds if institutions don’t have to prove compliance. 
For the five-year period, LSU did not document any interviews with the football, men’s basketball, men’s golf, women’s golf, gymnastics or track and field programs. No LSU team had at least one interview documented annually, and most sports went multiple years without having any interviews documented, representing more than 1,000 student athletes who may have had their feedback ignored. 

A review of the 64 athlete interview forms LSU provided in response to the public records requests revealed complaints about facilities and coaches — including multiple allegations of bullying and intimidation by swimming and diving coaches. 
It is rare for exit interviews from a major college athletic program to be released. In 2019, the online news outlet The Intercollegiate submitted public records requests for the interviews from every public NCAA Division I program. Most universities denied the requests, including LSU and almost every other Southeastern Conference institution. The unavailability of these records makes it difficult to compare LSU’s compliance with peer institutions. 



NCAA Bylaw 8.3 
​​The institution’s director of athletics, senior woman administrator or designated representatives (excluding coaching staff members) shall conduct exit interviews in each sport with a sample of student-athletes (as determined by the institution) whose eligibility has expired. Interviews shall include questions regarding the value of the students’ athletics experiences, the extent of the athletics time demands encountered by the student-athletes, proposed changes in intercollegiate athletics and concerns related to the administration of the student-athletes’ specific sports. 



Experts say not documenting student-athletes’ feedback is a disservice to them, and it raises concerns about whether the university is actually conducting the interviews at all. 
Molly Harry, a University of Florida sports management professor whose research has focused on NCAA exit interviews, said it is concerning LSU is not documenting its athletes’ feedback. 
“Athletes are gaining power economically, as we speak, with [revenue sharing] … but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they have the more procedural power in the athletics department,” Harry said. “These exit interviews could potentially lead to changes in the future through that procedure.” 
Greenwell did not respond to follow-up questions about why LSU only documents interviews for certain sports, how many interviews LSU has conducted in each sport or how LSU is able to use information it gathers in the interviews if no notes are taken. 
Harry said not recording interviews for men’s sports could lead to gender inequities, as they tend to have worse academic and social experiences than women athletes. Football and basketball programs also tend to have more taxing travel schedules, and not obtaining feedback from these teams leaves a significant gap in the data, she added. 
“You’re not getting the perspective of the high profile sports who might have found it pretty unmanageable,” Harry said. 
Allison Smith, a professor of sport management at Georgia State University, said allowing universities to self-police is a weakness in many NCAA bylaws. 
“The NCAA needs to uphold what the member institutions are doing regarding their bylaws,” Smith said. 
LSU initially attempted to deny the Illuminator’s public records request when it was made in 2023, arguing exit interviews were exempted from disclosure under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, a federal law that protects students’ personal information. 
With the help of the Tulane First Amendment Law Clinic, the Illuminator and Tiger Rag were able to obtain the 65 interviews that were recorded, though they were released with redactions. On each document, LSU redacted the student’s name as well as their response to questions about team medical and mental health providers.

Student-athlete exit interviews the Louisiana Illuminator and Tiger Rag obtained in a public records request to LSU show multiple complaints from swimming and diving athletes over three years. They center on head coach Rick Bishop and former associate head coach Leah Stancil, whose contract was not renewed when it expired earlier this year. 
When asked whether Stancil’s non-renewal was related to the complaints, LSU athletics spokesman Zach Greenwell said the university does not comment on specific personnel matters. Bishop and Stancil did not respond to requests for comment. The swimming and diving team has one set of coaches for both men and women athletes. 
In their interviews, the athletes allege the swimming and diving program was rife with bullying and motivation through fear. One athlete said the program broke them “physically and mentally,” while another said the coaches didn’t respect injuries. 
One student complained that Stancil “made her life hell,” the administrator who conducted the interview wrote, causing her to have a mental health crisis, and that the assistant coach ruined the sport for her. Multiple athletes said in their interviews that Stancil made fun of a Chinese student’s name, commented on athletes’ appearances and showed favoritism toward men on the team.

Other students reported that after a woman on the team complained about inappropriate behavior by male teammates, Bishop excused the men’s behavior in comments to the entire team, saying “boys are stupid and can make stupid decisions” while making direct eye contact with the woman who made the report. The interview records do not detail the nature of the inappropriate behavior. 
One student complained that Bishop intimidated her when she attempted to raise concerns about Stancil’s behavior, alleging the head coach would not let her read a letter detailing Stancil’s actions without Stancil present. 
“[It was] like asking you to report a bully while the bully is in the room with you,” the athlete wrote, adding she believed Bishop protected Stancil instead of her. 
One student said they believed LSU’s athletic department administration was aware of the coaches’ behavior. 
In a letter notifying Stancil her contract would not be renewed, LSU Athletics Director Scott Woodward thanked the coach for her contributions to the university. 
“We appreciate your dedication and wish you the best in future endeavors,” Woodward said in the letter, which the Illuminator and Tiger Rag obtained through a public records request. 
The Illuminator and Tiger Rag asked the university for copies of its student-athlete exit interviews from 2021-25. The NCAA requires all Division I schools to conduct interviews with a sampling of athletes every year once they graduate or after their eligibility expires, but the interviews do not have to be recorded. The process is intended to give athletes an opportunity to share feedback about their school’s sports programs. 
The swimming and diving teams, by far, had the most interviews recorded, with 35 students giving feedback over four years based on the records provided. Although 10 athletes criticized Stancil and Bishop, almost everyone interviewed had some positive comment about their athletics experience, including one person who praised Bishop’s coaching. 
After swimming and diving, the team with the most interviews recorded was the gymnastics team, with six interviews in two years. 
Six of LSU’s 16 athletics teams did not record a single interview over the five-year period. Those that did recorded very few interviews, sometimes going multiple years without any student feedback reported.

States have been reporting steady increases in vaccination exemption requests for kids. (Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)Dr. Rana Alissa hears it daily in her practice.
“It’s better for my kid to get the virus than get the vaccine.”
“The more you [doctors] vaccinate, the more money you get.”
“I did not vaccinate any of my kids, and I’m not going to vaccinate this one. So, please, don’t waste your time.”
The Jacksonville, Florida, pediatrician said on average, she’d hear vaccine skepticism from a couple of parents a month, at most, before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Now, it’s every day,” said Alissa, who is also president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Medical experts say hesitancy is likely to increase further as a result of misinformation pouring from the Trump administration — and turmoil at the federal agency largely responsible for setting vaccine policy.
On Thursday, three top officials were escorted out of the Atlanta headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All three officials resigned to protest the effort by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez for pushing back against Kennedy’s vaccine policies.
One of the officials, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, posted on X that he’s resigning because “the intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines” will cause the nation to suffer.
Earlier last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restricted access to updated COVID-19 shots. The new rules include limitations for young children that the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The FDA only approved COVID-19 vaccines for people who are 65 and older and those who are known to be at risk for a severe case. Consultation with a medical provider will be required before the shot is given to healthy children under 18, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
Despite federal shift, state health officials encourage COVID vaccines for pregnant women

In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics. Many states use the committee’s recommendations to develop their vaccine requirements. And in May, Kennedy rescinded recommendations for kids to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
In his books, experts say, Kennedy appears to promote his own version of miasma theory, an obsolete belief dating back to ancient times that diseases are caused by vapors from rotting organic matter. Scientists have since proven that microbes, not bad air, cause infectious diseases.
Experts say Kennedy’s actions are likely to make vaccination rates worse, paving the way for more outbreaks.
“Every vaccine that we give prevents a serious and life-threatening disease,” New York pediatrician Dr. Jesse Hackell, chair of the Committee on Pediatric Workforce at the American Academy of Pediatrics, told Stateline. “I don’t want to force anybody, but I do want to make sure that the information they’re getting is quality information — and that’s not what is coming from HHS.”
 Nonmedical exemptions

Every state requires kids to get certain shots to attend school. All states exempt children who can’t be immunized for medical reasons, but nonmedical exemptions for religious or personal reasons vary from state to state.
Vaccination rates among kids are declining. Flu vaccinations, for example, hit their lowest rate since 2019. And since the beginning of the pandemic, exemption requests have increased across the country.
Among kindergarteners, nonmedical exemptions have increased each year since 2020, from 1.9% in the first year of the pandemic to 3.4% in the 2024-25 school year, according to the latest data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C. Seventeen states reported exemption rates over 5%.
The changes may seem small. But experts say even slight increases in exemptions and decreases in vaccinations make a big difference.
“With a disease that’s as infectious as measles … small increases in vaccination rates could really go a long way,” epidemiologist Sophia Newcomer, a University of Montana associate professor, said in a recent panel discussion hosted by Montana Families for Vaccines.
Alissa and other experts say rampant confusion around the shots, including federal officials casting doubt, is exacerbating the problem. Often, parents aren’t sure whom they can trust, finding conflicting information and unreliable sources, she said.
“[Parents] come to our clinic and the hospitals and they say, ‘We looked it up, and we just don’t want it,’” she said. “There’s different kinds of reasoning: the ingredients of the vaccine, the side effects of the vaccine, ‘vaccines don’t work.’”
But research consistently shows vaccines protect children from serious illness. Shots also protect the most vulnerable who can’t get vaccinated, such as babies who are too young, or children and adults who are immunocompromised. Babies up to age 2 are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19, making up the most hospitalizations among kids.
Ultimately, Alissa said, “We are endangering each other.”
In Florida, where Alissa practices, religious exemptions have increased monthly, according to a state report that tracked the numbers through April. Some counties have higher rates of children with religious exemptions than others, ranging from about 1.5% to 15%, the state department of health reported. Among kindergarteners in the state, the rate of nonmedical exemptions rose from 2.7% in the 2020-21 school year to 4.8% in the 2024-25 school year, CDC data shows.











We are endangering each other.


– Dr. Rana Alissa, Jacksonville, Fla., pediatrician and president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics



Five states — California, Connecticut, Maine, New York and West Virginia — don’t allow nonmedical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two West Virginia families with immunocompromised kids brought lawsuits over Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s January executive order mandating religious exemptions despite state law.
Kennedy defended religious exemptions and endorsed the governor’s order in a post on X. His agency also sent letters to West Virginia health departments warning of civil rights violations if they don’t allow such exemptions.
“There’s a ton of variability across states in how easy it is to not get vaccinated,” Newcomer, of the University of Montana, said. Some states require parental vaccine education as part of the exemption request while others don’t.
“Increased exemptions needs to be fought at every level — working to make sure there’s access, to make sure that there’s good information, and to make sure that there’s strong policy at the state level, so that people aren’t exploiting exemption loopholes,” Northe Saunders, American Families for Vaccines president, said during the panel discussion.
 Other vaccines

Doctors are worried that other vaccines will be targeted by the Trump administration, such as those for whooping cough. By April, preliminary CDC data showed more than 9,000 cases this year, about twice as many compared with the same time last year and more than there were right before the pandemic. Whooping cough, or pertussis, can be deadly for babies. Vaccines help prevent severe whooping cough illness.
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

Hackell said that when he was training in the 1970s, there were no pneumococcal and haemophilus vaccines. Babies would come in with 104-degree fevers and they were immediately tested for the infections, he recalled. For babies under age 2, those bacterial infections can show up as only a high fever, but the infection can rapidly turn fatal without treatment, he told Stateline.
“When I trained, we didn’t have these vaccines, and these kids kept us up at night,” Hackell said. “I never want to practice in those days. I never want to go back to that. … To me, that is unacceptable to submit my patients to those risks that we’ve been able to reduce.”
This week the FDA removed one of the available COVID-19 vaccines for young children, limiting the Spikevax vaccine to only kids with at least one serious health issue. Moderna’s shot is still available for children 6 months and older. Pfizer’s shot is no longer available for kids under 5, as the FDA is ending its emergency use authorization for the age group.
But the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends COVID-19 shots for children 6 months to 2 years. It also recommends them for older children with underlying health issues. Healthy children whose parents want them to get the shot should also be offered them, the AAP says.
Hackell is concerned by the FDA’s new limitations on the shot.
“As a parent, as a grandparent and as a physician who takes care of vulnerable kids, it disgusts me,” Hackell said.
He’s also concerned about vulnerable kids who get their shots through the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program, which covers shots if parents can’t afford them and follows federal vaccine advisory recommendations.
“If you’re covered by VFC, which is basically kids on Medicaid and a few other populations, then you’re out of luck,” Hackell said. “To me, that’s a huge inequity in access to care, which is indefensible.”
He added that the move breaks with the administration’s emphasis on individual decision-making, saying the new restrictions limit parental decisions.
 ‘Normalization’ of outbreaks

During the Montana panel discussion, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, pointed to CDC data showing that over the past year alone, about 1 in 5 children and adolescents hospitalized with COVID-19 were put in the ICU. And between September 2023 and last August, 152 children died of COVID-19 and 213 children died of the flu.
While Texas officially declared its measles outbreak over — which means the state hasn’t reported a new case in six weeks — neighboring New Mexico continues to see new cases.
Vaccination rates are declining. They might get worse as states relax rules.

“What we’re going to see is, you know, sadly, a normalization of these outbreaks,” said Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer at The Immunization Partnership, a Texas-based vaccine education organization. “We need to make sure that kids are protected against the diseases that they can be protected against, because we truly are in a vulnerable state right now.”
Newcomer, the Montana epidemiologist, said that under-vaccination trends are usually due to disparities in access, such as challenges in reaching vaccine providers in rural communities. At rural health care centers lacking staff and technology, it’s harder to automate vaccination reminders for patients — which can increase the likelihood patients show up for appointments but require technical infrastructure, she explained.
Adding misinformation to the mix only makes matters worse, experts say.
“Parents are confused and understandably concerned,” Offit told Stateline. “It’s the most vulnerable among us that will suffer, and that will be our children.”
He added that he’s also wary about the federal administration’s removal of data, concerned that vaccination figures will be next.
“It’s nightmarish,” he said. “What worries me the most is we’re not going to know the degree that we’re suffering. We’re not, because the CDC is losing its capacity to do adequate surveillance across the country.”

The Bureau of Land Management is holding a lease sale Wednesday for land at the Freedom Mine north of Beulah. 
The Coteau Properties Co. has applied to lease approximately 1,070 acres containing an estimated 18.3 million tons of recoverable federal coal. If approved, the lease would allow continued operations at the Freedom Mine through 2045.

North American Coal is pursuing a lease to mine 800 acres of federal land at the Falkirk Mine near Underwood in central North Dakota. The mine feeds the nearby Coal Creek Station power plant. A lease sale is set for Sept. 10.  
A coalition of environmental groups, including North Dakota-based Dakota Research Council, has filed comments opposing Falkirk leases with the Bureau of Land Management and the Office of Surfacing Mining, Reclamation and Enforcement — agencies that fall under the Department of the Interior. Fort Berthold POWER (Protectors of Water and Earth Rights) also was included in comments on the Freedom Mine lease. 
The group Earthjustice took the lead on both comment submissions, saying newly implemented leasing procedures by the Department of the Interior are relying on a Trump administration’s energy emergency proclamation that environmental groups argue cut corners in the environmental assessment process. 
President Donald Trump on Jan. 20 declared an energy emergency. It says the United States’ “inadequate energy supply and infrastructure causes and makes worse the high energy prices that devastate Americans.” 
Scott Skokos, executive director of the Dakota Resource Council, said with stable electric and home heating prices, there is no energy emergency. 
“The whole justification for this doesn’t make any sense,” Skokos said. 
David Straley is manager of government and public affairs at North American Coal, which owns the Falkirk Mine and Coteau Properties Co. He said the company is trying to fill its obligation to the Coal Creek power plant as efficiently as possible. The company first applied for the Falkirk lease in 2019.
North American Coal revised its request in 2020 and 2021. Those requests were neither denied nor granted. 
The 800 acres is projected to produce 11 million tons of coal over 15 years.
“North American Coal believes that these natural resources are for the betterment of the United States, for the betterment of our economy, and they help strengthen our electrical grid and our national security,” Straley said. 
In addition to the energy emergency, Trump in April issued an executive order about revitalizing the coal industry, including removing impediments to mining coal on federal land. 
Also this spring, Interior announced it would allow “alternative arrangements for NEPA compliance,” referring to the National Environmental Policy Act. It cited the energy emergency as allowing an expedited process. 
On June 20, the Bureau of Land Management and the Office of Surfacing Mining announced a public comment period on the environmental assessment for the Falkirk Mine. The agencies accepted comments from June 23 to July 7. There was a public hearing in Underwood on July 7, but no members of the public attended.

An April 24 hearing on the Freedom Mine in Beulah also had no members of the public in attendance. 
One objection from the environmental coalition is that the Department of the Interior’s alternative process does not allow adequate time for a properly researched environmental assessment or for the public to comment on the assessment. 
“In the past, the Department of Interior, the Bureau of Land Management and the Office of Surface Mining would notify people of a public comment period and try to encourage public involvement, but that’s clearly not what happened here,” Shiloh Hernandez, an Earthjustice attorney said.
Skokos said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota, is “putting his finger on the scales for fossil fuels.” 
Skokos predicted Trump’s energy emergency will be challenged in court, though it may not be challenged through these leases. 
“Nothing is illegal until a judge rules on it,” Skokos said. 
Acting BLM Director Bill Groffy said in a news release that the Freedom Mine lease sale reflects the Trump administration’s commitment to expanding domestic energy production. “The proposed lease will help maintain operations at one of the nation’s most productive lignite coal mines, supporting local jobs and reinforcing America’s energy security,” Groffy said in the release. 
Straley said without the ability to mine the federal land, the company would “would literally go around” that land and it would be difficult to return to it. 
“You kind of get one bite at the apple,” he said. 
The emergency coal lease application for Freedom Mine says if the coal deposits are not leased, they may be bypassed. If leased, at least some of the coal would be mined within three years. 
Other Earthjustice objections to the mines include pollution from the power plants. 
The comments note that Coal Creek Station is designated by the Environmental Defense Fund as the largest mercury emitting coal plant in the country. 
Earthjustice said that if the agencies regard emissions from the coal plants as an indirect effect of the mining, the emissions must still be included in an analysis required by the National Environmental Policy Act.
The Environmental Protection Agency had tightened mercury emissions rules under the Biden administration, which North Dakota regulators had called “a death sentence” for the state’s coal industry. The Trump administration has been rolling back environmental regulations. 
“I would say the (mercury) rule’s on life support right now, and they’re not currently applying it to the Coal Creek Station or any coal plant in North Dakota,” Hernandez said. 
Jessica Bell, vice president of external affairs for Rainbow Energy, which operates Coal Creek Station, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. 
Basin Electric Power Cooperative said in a statement that the cooperative and its subsidiaries have invested more than $2 billion in environmental control technologies. Since the cooperative began monitoring mercury in 2015, it has reduced mercury emissions intensity by nearly 80%, according to the statement.
North Dakota’s Lignite Energy Council deferred comment on the mining applications to the mining companies.

After Trump’s executive order on coal, the group praised the move as did North Dakota’s congressional delegation. 
“President Trump’s leadership sends a clear message: America is done apologizing for using its natural resources,” Jonathan Fortner, interim president and CEO of the Lignite Energy Council said in a news release. “Coal is not just an energy source — it’s a strategic asset.”
The industry group says North Dakota has an 800-year supply of lignite coal, and “a proud track record of environmental stewardship.” 
The group says North Dakota has never violated federal ambient air quality standards.
“We mine responsibly, reclaim the land after mining, and provide the most affordable, reliable power in the nation,” Fortner said in the release.

Many in the wildland fire community believe the leadership team managing the fire sent crews into an ambush by federal immigration agents. (Facebook/Bear Gulch Fire 2025)Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities last week raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.
Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.
Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.
The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.
“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”
Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.
One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.
“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”
Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.
Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.
After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.
After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.
“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”
In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.
Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.
“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”
After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.
The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.
Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.
A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.
The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.
“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.
Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.
The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.
Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.
One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.
The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.
“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”
Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.
“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.
On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.
“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”
Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.
“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”
Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.
“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”
In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A developmental disability service provider is suing Nebraska’s Department of Health and Human Services over a 2024 order the provider claims was unconstitutional.
Integrated Life Choices (ILC) filed a complaint in Lancaster District Court Aug. 25 against DHHS and Developmental Disabilities Director Tony Green. The complaint claims the department violated the constitutional separation of powers by unilaterally mandating providers switch to a new emergency safety intervention program called The Mandt System.

In February 2024, DHHS issued a bulletin requiring providers to exclusively use Mandt for staff training by July 2025. Providers that did not comply faced decertification and a loss of Medicaid funding, according to the complaint.
In a press release from the Pacific Legal Foundation, which is helping represent ILC in the lawsuit, The Mandt System is a for-profit program designed for both children and adults. With ILC’s services being adult-focused, the release argues that The Mandt System is not suited for all Nebraska providers.
Furthermore, the mandate was expensive. The release claims that implementing the new training cost ILC at least $60,000 to cover its 10 trainers, and comes with recurring costs every two years.
ILC attempted to stand its ground and maintain the group’s former training program, which the complaint alleges DHHS approved in 2021. But starting on July 2, DHHS stopped referring new clients to ILC, forcing the provider to comply, according to the complaint.
“In Nebraska’s developmental disabilities system, referrals function like the doctor’s note you need before seeing a specialist — they are the formal authorization that allows a provider to begin serving a new client under the state’s waiver program,” the release explained. “Without them, no new clients can enter ILC’s services, threatening both its financial viability and its ability to serve vulnerable Nebraskans.”
The complaint alleges that the department’s mandate executed legislative power without legislative approval, thus violating powers reserved for the Legislature, not the executive branch. However, multiple lawmakers said they weren’t certain that this authority would normally fall to them.
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, a vocal critic of DHHS in recent years, said she wasn’t certain the department needed legislative approval to implement this type of program. She said she’s heard that The Mandt System is well-respected but noted that the lawsuit touches on a longstanding issue of a lack of transparency within DHHS and a history of unilateral changes it has put in place without following proper procedure.
Cavanaugh argued that DHHS should have followed its own regulatory process when implementing the mandate, which would have come with a public hearing or an equivalent step in gathering public feedback.
The complaint also alleges DHHS violated due process and Nebraska’s Administrative Procedure Act. It claims DHHS issued the bulletin without following the “notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures” outlined by the American Psychological Association and argued that the review and appeal process the department offered providers was inadequate.

Sen. Dan Quick of Grand Island, a Democrat on the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, agreed that this has been a common problem with DHHS.
The complaint highlights a bill Quick introduced earlier this year, Legislative Bill 565, which seeks to crack down on authoritative bulletins issued specifically by DHHS’ Division of Developmental Disabilities. The amended bill would rescind guidance documents issued by the division after July 1, 2022, and pause new bulletins until July 1, 2027, unless the changes were required for federal compliance.
Quick said he brought the bill after hearing concerns from multiple providers that the division was using guidance documents and provider bulletins as a means of implementing major changes without following the department’s regulatory process. He said many of these changes came with high costs.
Quick’s top concern, however, was how such administrative disputes would impact the services’ clients.
“They’re the ones who get hurt in this whole process,” Quick said.
LB 565 stalled in committee, but Quick said after the session he met with DHHS. He claimed officials told him the department had settled the dispute with providers and that the reason for the bulletins is that DHHS’ regulatory process could not keep up with the pace of new federal guidance.
However, when Quick relayed that information to providers, they told him a different story. They claimed that the issue was not settled and that they would have no problem complying with new federal orders.
DHHS said the agency can’t comment on pending litigation.
Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, a Republican lawmaker on the HHS Committee, said the lawsuit touches on a gray area between state agency authority and legislative oversight. He couldn’t say whether DHHS overreached with the bulletin but noted the case may boil down to whether ILC had a contract that the department was trying to alter midway through.
“If you don’t have it in writing, you don’t have a real foundation,” Riepe said.

If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org
On a Tuesday afternoon in July, inside The Bar Ber Shop in Raleigh, Reggie Winston, 41, talks about a subject many of his young clients rarely discuss anywhere else: mental health. 
Winston, who is trained in mental health first aid and suicide prevention, remembers battling depression in high school without realizing it. “I had no clue what I was experiencing was depression,” he said. It wasn’t until he heard someone else’s story that he recognized his own, a realization that led him to therapy and, eventually, a mission.  
After the COVID-19 pandemic, Winston expanded the community work he’d started years earlier with free blood pressure screenings in his shop. This time, he turned to mental health, founding Grooming Resources and Opportunities, a nonprofit that trains barbers to spot signs of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. 
His method begins with seemingly casual questions when someone climbs into his barber chair. Instead “How are you?” he’ll ask, “What time did you wake up? What are your plans today?” As he snips and shapes, his clients reveal pieces of their lives they rarely share anywhere else.
Slowly, in the safety of his barber chair, these simple inquiries allow clients to reveal what’s really happening in their lives, Winston said.  
“Once they get comfortable and start trusting you with their haircut,” Winston said, “they start trusting you with their mind and their heart.” 
From 2013 to 2022, 377 Black North Carolinians ages 10 to 24 died by suicide, according to data. Nearly 17% of Black high school students said they had seriously considered suicide. Among middle schoolers, more than a third reported the same. The numbers peak at age 24 — and are especially stark for Black girls questioning their sexual orientation, who now report the highest rates of suicide attempts in schools statewide. 
“The myth that Black people don’t die by suicide has been dangerous,” said Bettie Murchison, a longtime advocate who runs the Village of C.A.R.E. in Wake County. “We’ve had to fight against that in our families, in our churches, and in our schools.”

Winston’s effort is a key part of North Carolina’s response to rising suicide rates among Black youth. This year, the state health department launched the Black Youth Suicide Prevention Action Plan, a five-year initiative that leans on trusted community spaces, including barbershops and churches, to expand support and prevent suicide among Black youth and young adults. Unlike the state’s broader suicide-prevention strategy, this plan focuses on the unique needs of Black youth.  
Dr. Sonyia Richardson, a UNC Chapel Hill researcher and one of the plan’s architects, said it was built on listening sessions with young people and their communities. “This is not a top-down plan,” she said. “It’s community-led, community-driven, community-implemented.” 
One of its guiding principles: young people in crisis often turn not to doctors, but to trusted adults in familiar places — coaches, pastors, aunties, barbers. 
“We’re meeting the needs of communities where youth are more likely to seek support. From local YMCAs, churches, and community centers rather than traditional mental health providers,” Richardson said. 
Barbershops and churches 
That’s where Winston and his longtime friend, counselor Rodney Harris, come in. This year alone, he and Harris have trained more than a dozen barbers in mental health first aid training. These programs teach them to spot warning signs of mental distress and suicide, as well as how to safely talk with clients about limiting access to firearms and other deadly means. They’ve trained barbers across Raleigh, Wake Forest and Durham. Soon they’ll be in Rocky Mount. 
“Barbers often know more about their clients’ lives than anyone else,” Harris said. “When a clinician approaches, youth might be skeptical. But when a barber speaks, they listen.” 
Barbershops have become hubs for this work well beyond North Carolina. The Confess Project, for example, has trained barbers across the country in mental health advocacy. 
What’s different with GRO is that they train barbers to become community leaders themselves, Harris said. “What we saw as a gap in the research is to make the barbers trainers and then have them go into the community, offer additional trainings, and then they can also offer recruitment,” Harris said. That work, he added, includes expanding mental health first aid and counseling on access to lethal means, known as CALM.
The same approach is playing out in churches. Through Murchison’s Village of C.A.R.E. program, she trains pastors and faith leaders to act as first responders. “If we can get them to understand this is as much a part of their ministry as teaching the Bible,” she said, “we can reach a generation of youth who don’t see a therapist as their first line of defense.”

 Building trust beyond the shop

State officials have identified 17 counties in North Carolina that are in urgent need of suicide prevention efforts. These counties, which range from major metropolitan areas like Durham, Wake, and Mecklenburg to smaller, rural communities such as Edgecombe, Halifax and Hoke, have the highest rates of Black youth suicides and the highest volume of 988 crisis calls. In each of these communities, Black residents make up at least 25% of the population. 
Still, many young people don’t trust the 988 Lifeline. Black youth are underrepresented among callers, even though they show up disproportionately in emergency room visits for self-injury. Officials say building confidence in the hotline is essential to reaching young people before a crisis escalates.  
Kelly Crosbie, director of the state’s Division of Mental Health, said fear and mistrust keep many from using the hotline. “There’s just personal shame, not knowing who’s on the other end, and what’s going to happen,” she said. Some families worry that calling could trigger involuntary hospitalization or even police involvement. “Some of these young folks, their families have already experienced trauma when they’ve tried to engage with treatment systems or government systems,” she added. 










Once they get comfortable and start trusting you with their haircut,” Winston said, “they start trusting you with their mind and their heart.

Mistrust can run even deeper for LGBTQ youth. In North Carolina, Black girls who are questioning their sexual orientation now report the highest rates of suicide attempts in schools statewide. At the same time, the federal government eliminated funding for the 988 “Press 3” option, which connected LGBTQ and transgender callers to specialized counselors. Advocates warn the loss strips away a culturally competent lifeline that has reached more than a million young people nationwide. 
State officials say they have begun training local crisis counselors to handle calls from that population and are working with communities to ensure that 988 operators are equipped with inclusive, culturally aware training. “We’re losing that specialized national line,” Crosbie told NC Health News last month, “but we are making sure our 988 here is well-trained and ready.” 
The state has also launched a youth-led awareness campaign, called “Stronger Together” initiative. Messaging, visuals, and formats are being created by Black youth themselves to make the hotline feel credible and relatable. “We need to get the messaging straight from young people,” Crosbie said. The effort includes training peers and trusted community figures—like pastors, coaches, and barbers—to recognize warning signs and encourage youth to seek help. 
Current data shows texting and chat are the most utilized 988 services among North Carolina youth. Crosbie said that makes it even more important to meet young people where they are—whether that’s on their phones, in churches, or in barbershops. “We need to make sure the help is in places and spaces that people trust,” she said. 
In addition to breaking cultural stigmas surrounding mental health discussions, other strategies include reducing access to lethal means and providing gun locks, and hosting community trainings. 
The first Black youth suicide prevention conference is scheduled for September in Rocky Mount, which is one of the high need areas. Richardson hopes the plan will serve as a national model for suicide prevention among diverse populations. “We are focusing on those populations most impacted in our state… and I think this also provides a blueprint for how to create [prevention strategies] across the state.”
Back at The Bar Ber Shop, Winston says he sees that trust forming every day. Kids sit in his chair for a haircut and end up sharing the things they don’t tell teachers or parents. 
“Barbers are the bridge for people to get the help they need,” Winston said. “We are the trusted few.”

(Facebook/Bear Gulch Fire 2025)Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities last week raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.
Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.
Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.
The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.
“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”
Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.
One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.
“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”
Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.
Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.
After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.
After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.
“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”
In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.
Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.
“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”
After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.
The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.
Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.
A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.
The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.
“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.
Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.
The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.
Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.
One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.
The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.
“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”
Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.
“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.
On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.
“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”
Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.
“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”
Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.
“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”
In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.

Patrick Morrisey)WorkForce West Virginia recently released data that shows the state’s labor force has been in a steady decline for the last 14 months.
The Mountain State has lost more than 4,000 jobs and about 7,600 people from its workforce in the last year. The amount of people leaving the workforce is more than the amount of jobs lost because our workforce is aging, retiring and we have a high rate of people with a disability or chronic illness that can’t work or have trouble finding work, according to Kelly Allen, executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. There’s also people who decide to no longer work so that they can stay home to care for a child or family member.
At least 400 federal jobs have been lost in West Virginia from cuts made by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), but that number could be higher, according to the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. Data related to those cuts is delayed, and doesn’t include recent layoffs or employees who were placed on administrative leave or took involuntary buyouts. 
The agencies who have been most impacted by those cuts are the Bureau of the Fiscal Service in Parkersburg, NIOSH in Morgantown, the Job Corps Center in Charleston and National Park Service staff in the Monongahela National Forest and the New River Gorge National Park.
The West Virginia Chamber of Commerce is alarmed about the job report.
Chamber President Steve Roberts said when West Virginia was ranked as last in the country for job growth that the chamber started to look into the numbers.
In fact, between 2024 and May 2025, the state had the largest decrease in non-farm employment in the U.S. at 1.3%, according to the report. 
“That’s one of those lists we don’t want to be on. ‘Why don’t we go in and take a deeper dive and take a deeper look? What can we figure out is going on?’ and the more we looked, the more concerned we became,” Roberts told WV MetroNews.
WorkForce West Virginia’s jobs report showed that several key industries — hospitality, manufacturing, mining and retail — all have declining numbers. 
Roberts said the workforce “has shifted from being a manual labor workforce to a digital workforce, and we need to tell our children that.”
“We really have to look at education, how we’re performing, and what we can do to help our kids be more prepared for the future,” he said.
Sounds like investing in our public schools and teachers would be a great way to address job loss.
At the Chamber of Commerce’s Business Summit last week, Gov. Patrick Morrisey revealed his big economic plan to try to get the state’s job numbers back up — cutting regulations, investing in energy and scrutinizing the use of taxpayer dollars to lure businesses into West Virginia.
Cutting regulations sounds worrying, especially if it’s environmental regulations, which Morrisey has proven not to be a fan of. However, he did give a good example — a bill passed this year that allows occupational licensing reciprocity, which allows new residents to transfer their occupational and professional licenses from another state to West Virginia. 
If that’s the kind of regulations we’re cutting, then great. But if he’s going to follow in President Donald Trump’s footsteps — which he most often does — we might see Morrisey trying to cut health and safety regulations that are meant to protect workers. Risking people’s health and lives to help businesses is never the answer.
To invest in energy, Morrisey launched his “Economic Backyard Brawl,” to focus on developing energy infrastructure to compete with other states. This is where the microgrids and data centers come in that residents are overwhelmingly opposing throughout the state.
Morrisey ended his speech at the summit talking about how the state’s workforce could be improved — by doing a complete “overhaul” of the WorkForce West Virginia website.
“Recruiting, retention and retraining has to be one of our big hallmarks,” Morrisey said. 
You know what would help with recruitment and retention? Do literally anything to help with child care. Lawmakers need to start thinking of the children. Investing in child care is imperative.
Research by the tech company Wonderschool found that about half of West Virginia businesses reported that child care challenges frequently or very frequently affected their employees’ ability to work. And 70% reported they were doing nothing to help with those challenges.
We’ve had two legislative sessions where lawmakers said lack of affordable child care is a major problem and then did nothing to help the industry or the families that need it. There are areas with no child care and where there are facilities most have very limited spots. How can people work if there’s no one to watch their children? Or if they can’t even afford to put them in daycare?
Child care centers are losing money, resulting in closures. I can’t think of a better place to use some of that $254.8 million surplus in the state budget.

In western Michigan, a previously defunct nuclear plant has transitioned back to operating status following the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s decision to reauthorize power operations.
As of Aug. 25, the Palisades Power Plant is the first nuclear plant in the United States to transition from decommissioning status back to operations, according to the plant’s owner, Holtec International.
The former Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, will follow in the Michigan plant’s footsteps. Constellation Energy is currently working to reopen the nuclear facility — renamed Crane Clean Energy Center — by 2027. That’s a year earlier than initially expected.
It is slated to power data centers for Microsoft. An agreement reached between the tech company and Constellation is reported to last 20 years, could create around 3,400 jobs and bring $3 billion in state and federal taxes.
The Michigan plant can begin receiving nuclear fuel and restart operations once certain conditions of the plant’s technical specifications are met.
While the company works on repairing the plant’s steam generators, alongside reassembling the main generator and turbine, Holtec says the plant is squarely in the final phase of its restart preparations.
“This is a proud and historic moment for our team, for Michigan, and for the United States,” Holtec International President Kelly Trice said in a statement. “The [commision’s] approval to transition Palisades back to an operating license represents an unprecedented milestone in U.S. nuclear energy. Our mission remains clear: to restart Palisades safely, securely, reliably, and in support of America’s energy future – while supporting local jobs and economic growth for decades to come.”

Upon returning to operations, Holtec said the facility will produce 800 megawatts of electricity, enough to power over 800,000 homes and businesses.
While the plant has received support from Michigan Democrats and Republicans alike, the plant is not without its opponents, with Kevin Kamps of the anti-nuclear advocacy group Beyond Nuclear arguing lawmakers and regulators are “playing radioactive Russian roulette on the Lake Michigan shore.”
“Holtec’s Palisades zombie reactor restart scheme is not only unprecedented, but also unneeded, insanely expensive for taxpayers and ratepayers, and very risky for health, safety, security and the environment,” Kamps said in a statement.
Opponents of the plant’s restart have argued the funds used to restart the plant – including a $1.5 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy and $300 million in state funding – could be better spent on renewable energy sources like wind and solar.
Residents living near the plant have also raised health concerns with a survey of 702 full and part-time residents living 400 yards to a mile from the reactor finding those individuals were five times more likely to develop thyroid cancer in their lifetime than the rest of the nation.

Domestic violence drives other violent crime in Kentucky and contributes to criminal recidivism all while draining law enforcement and court resources across the commonwealth, reports the Council of State Governments.
Over the past two years, the council’s Justice Center dug into Kentucky’s domestic violence data. Representatives from the nonpartisan organization presented their wide-ranging findings to the legislature’s Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary Friday. 
David D’Amora, a senior policy advisor at the Justice Center, said Kentucky has a “high prevalence of domestic violence and victimization,” which is a “major driver” of other violent crime. Reducing this crime by 25% could save the state $10 million over five years. 
After 2 women die in ‘ambush’ outside Hardin courthouse, what can Kentucky do better?

Kentucky has higher rates of domestic violence than the national average: 48% of Kentucky women will experience intimate partner violence or stalking, compared with 47% nationally. About 52% of men in Kentucky will also experience this, which is higher than the national percentage of 44%, according to the center’s data. 
The state does well in several ways, he said, including passing a law in 2025 to stiffen penalties for those who violate protective orders. 
Still, D’Amora said, “there’s significant room for improvement in how the commonwealth supports and provides resources to victims.” 
Kentucky does not compensate victims through the Office of Victims of Crime as much as most of its neighbors. This office helps victims pay for medical and funeral expenses, mental health treatment or other necessary costs.

“Some of this just has to do with the complication and how people file or need to file,” D’Amora said. “It’s not Kentucky’s unwillingness to do so, but there are just some barriers in the way that make it difficult for folks to file and get that compensation.” 
Just 3% of Kentucky domestic violence victims receive compensation. That’s higher than 2.6% in Indiana but lower than Tennessee (5%), Illinois (5.7%), Ohio (6.7%), Missouri (9%), West Virginia (11%) and Virginia (28%). 
Center researchers “had to stop” before finishing their analysis of Kentucky’s domestic violence landscape, D’Amora said, because “federal funding that was available for this work went away.” 
“We wanted to come back to present what we were able to find before we had to stop,” he said. “We’re here today on our own dime. We’re not here today because the federal folks are continuing to fund the project. The project is over, and we had to stop sort of midstream.” 
By the numbers
 Over the six-year period analyzed by the Council of State Governments, around half of all of the violent crimes in Kentucky involved domestic violence
Over the six-year period analyzed by the Council of State Governments, around half of all of the violent crimes in Kentucky involved domestic violence.
Between 2016–2021, of the 228,201 crimes, 108,401 — 48% — were related to interpersonal violence. 
“We suspect that it is higher than that,” D’Amora said. “What we know from research is that when we look at the (National Incident-Based Reporting System) numbers, that the incidents where alcohol or drugs are involved, there’s typically significant under reporting. It would not surprise me if we were looking at close to double that amount in these types of crimes.” 
Other data presented to the committee showed: 

From 2016 to 2021, 22% of homicide victims, 62% of kidnapping victims and 59% of simple assaults were also survivors of intimate partner violence.
From 2016 to 2021, alcohol and/or drugs were involved in at least 24% of all intimate partner violence cases. 
Both incidents of intimate partner violence and arrests increased over the six years the council analyzed. 
From 2008 to 2022, charges filed in Kentucky regarding violations of protective orders are up 43%. Convictions for those violations have increased 124%. 
From 2016-2022, filings for temporary protective orders increased by nearly 10%. The number of permanent orders granted during that same time period decreased by about 23%. 
As of September 2024, about 84% of law enforcement officers did not have screening tools to evaluate the level of danger a survivor of domestic violence was in. Nearly 90% of officers surveyed at that time reported having policies on how to respond to domestic violence and 97% said they’d received some guidance. 
In 2022, 33% of people in Department of Corrections custody had been defendants in prior domestic violence-related civil protective order cases. 
In 2022, 26% of people under supervision from the Department of Corrections had been defendants in prior domestic violence-related civil protective order cases. 
From 2018-2022, about 8% of perpetrators were reported in two or more incidents over the five year period. Repeat calls to the same location are a “key issue” in these cases, D’Amora said, adding that targeting response efforts on those repeat offenders could help reduce recidivism. 
In 2022, there were about 39,000 law enforcement responses to domestic violence reports and 9,472 arrests. Each of these cases can take more time than other calls and more officers per response. Meanwhile, 80% of law enforcement around Kentucky said they don’t have a large enough staff to effectively handle the caseload. 

 From 2016 to 2021, 22% of homicide victims, 62% of kidnapping victims and 59% of simple assaults were also survivors of intimate partner violence.
Looking to North Carolina 
The High Point Police Department in North Carolina has seen “substantial reductions” in its domestic violence recidivism by targeting people who’ve already offended, D’Amora shared as a potential model for Kentucky to study. 
“The model has them identifying the people who are most likely to commit violent crimes, investigating carefully and prosecuting, pursuing criminal charges, notifying them that future crimes will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, offering resources in the community to help people who commit (domestic violence) change their lifestyles, following up with those people in their progress to ensure they’re not committing further crimes, and then evaluating each case to determine if the individual was helped,” he said. 
These interventions lowered their rates of interpersonal violence homicides, domestic disturbance calls, domestic violence reoffenses and more. Victim injuries and arrests fell from around 67% to 47%, according to the council’s data. 
“Did they make it go away? No,” D’Amora said. “Did they significantly increase public safety? Yes, very much so, as well as helping lower the number of resources that were being used for this problem.” 
 Kentucky has higher rates of domestic violence than the national average: 48% of Kentucky women will experience intimate partner violence or stalking, compared with 47% nationally. About 52% of men in Kentucky will also experience this, which is higher than the national percentage of 44%, according to the center’s data.

This is the view to the east from the Pinnacles. (Photo by Whitney McKnight, The Edge)BEREA — Five property owners in Madison County’s Big Hill, Pilot Knob and Red Lick communities plus a few more in adjoining Jackson County were among the last to know the details of a plan to build a nearly nine-mile long transmission line through their respective properties.
Eastern Kentucky Power Cooperative’s first public announcement that it would construct the 69 kilovolt Big Hill-Three Links line (aka, the Big Hill line), and a substation on Red Lick Road, came in the form of a legally mandated letter, sent in September 2023, to area residents determined by the co-op to be most impacted by the development.
The letter told of a meeting to be held a couple of weeks later at Berea College’s Forestry Outreach Center where all would be explained. 
The letter did not reach all relevant addresses, instead arriving at several homes which were not in the direct path of the transmission line. But word spread quickly among neighbors, and on the night of the meeting, the room was filled to overflowing with people who wanted answers to their many questions.
Questions such as, why had no one in the neighborhood been consulted about the plan for the power line before it was determined? What did this mean for property values? What about the view from the Pinnacles? What might be the impact on the watershed for Owsley Fork reservoir, the primary water source for much of the county and all of Berea? Would the line adversely impact tourism in an area popular with outdoor enthusiasts?
Area resident Nicole Garneau recalled the scene in an interview with The Edge. “We all came with our questions, but it wasn’t a real meeting. EKPC had little stations where it was one of their people to one of ours. It was divide and conquer. It’s not like there were chairs arranged so we could sit together and listen to someone talk to everyone all at once and answer our questions so everyone could hear the answer.”

Garneau, who lives in Clear Creek, does not own property directly impacted by the line, but says she enjoys spending time in the wooded landscape that surrounds the reservoir and on the Pinnacles, a network of trails in the Berea College Forest leading to sweeping views from popular overlooks.
She began walking around the room where the meeting was being held, waving protest signs she and others had made in advance of the meeting. Then she grabbed a microphone and demanded the representatives from the power co-op face the crowd.
That night at the Forestry Outreach Center marks the beginning of a now two-years long struggle to demand the power cooperative listen to its member constituents and be transparent about its movements to build the line. 
Their success, however, has been minimal according to some.
“One thing the Big Hill Line exemplifies is the inability of the people to be able to actually participate in the government,” activist and Berean Bugz Fraugg told The Edge in a text. “People were willing to come together to understand the project and to negotiate. EKPC has been unwilling to have frank conversations with concerned constituents that will be impacted by the Big Hill Line, whether or not they are land owners. Poor communication seems to be their strategy.”
Amber Falle and her husband, Marty, Jackson County property owners who are being sued by EKPC in an eminent domain case, are among those who believe the power cooperative deliberately avoids communicating clearly about its intentions. 
“We never got that letter they supposedly sent out in September,” Amber told The Edge in an interview. “We didn’t get a letter until February 2024,” she said. 
Robert McNamara, deputy litigation director for The Institute for Justice, a nonprofit public interest law firm in the Washington, D.C. area, told The Edge in an interview that property owners potentially impacted by eminent domain are typically given as little information as possible by the entity doing the taking. “They are likely the last to know about plans that might involve condemnation,” he said. Condemnation is the technical term for when land is taken for public use. 
 Increased demand for power 

EKPC, along with other power utilities across the state, are under pressure to improve and expand Kentucky’s aging power grid, particularly as demand for energy increases to support the Beshear administration’s bid for rapid high-tech industrial growth across the commonwealth.

Federal statistics show that Kentucky is already one of the nation’s most energy-intensive economies, ranking among the top 10 states for amount of energy used per dollar of gross domestic product. 
Industry is the state’s largest energy consumer, accounting for more than a third of all end-use energy consumption statewide. Add in the state’s new electric vehicle battery factories, plus the increasing number of data centers and that usage is predicted by EKPC’s regional transmission organization to soar.
EKPC is part of the regional grid known as PJM, so-named for its original founding states, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. The PJM regional transmission organization now includes Kentucky, several other states and the District of Columbia.
PJM’s long range forecast released earlier this year is for summer peak energy demand in the region to more than triple in the next 15 years, from 70,000 megawatts, to 220,000 megawatts. The PJM notes in its report that current energy usage projections equal the fastest rising demand for power since 2006, and specifies data centers and EV battery manufacturing as key to this trend.
“EKPC is taking steps to prevent outages from happening,” EKPC spokesperson, Nick Comer, told The Edge in an email. “During extreme cold weather in January 2025, high electricity usage caused substation equipment [serving the southern end of the county] to operate near its capacity, threatening overload, which could cause power outages for homes and businesses.”
Comer said that the majority of the power cooperative members in the southeastern part of Madison County are served by a substation that currently serves 4,100 meters, “more than any other substation in EKPC’s system”. 
Once the Big Hill line is completed, only about 1,500 meters will be connected to the substation on Red Lick Road, he said. “This will provide more flexibility to serve these homes with electricity from either the south or the north, reducing the risk of outages,” Comer said.
Questions about the line remain
The power co-op claims it has accommodated local residents impacted by the line. “EKPC has listened and responded to the concerns of the community and affected property owners about potential impacts of this project,” Comer wrote in the email. “EKPC is taking reasonable steps to mitigate impacts while ensuring reliable electric service.”
Opponents disagree.

When the power co-op sued Berea College earlier this summer to condemn less than a mile of the forest to build a portion of the transmission line, the college responded by demanding answers to multiple questions about how and why EKPC planned to build the line, and what other alternatives exist — questions, the college said in a statement, it has been asking the power utility to answer since the outset in 2023. 
The college’s response to EKPC’s complaint, filed with the Madison County Circuit Court, also demanded a slew of documents the college said EKPC had previously been unwilling to produce, including proof of an environmental impact study.
The utility has until Sept. 15 to respond, but has since issued a public statement indicating it has conducted a federally stipulated environmental study, saying the study has been, “reviewed and approved by the Rural Utilities Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.” The statement also reiterated that the power co-op, “has listened and responded to the concerns of the community and affected property owners about potential impacts of this project.”
Previous attempts by the Kentucky Resource Council to receive evidence of an environmental impact study also went unanswered in the past.
 Potential environmental impacts

The Edge requested a copy of the impact report from EKPC but did not receive it. A letter from the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Fish and Wildlife Division’s Kentucky field office, however, indicates it assessed the area to be impacted by the line and that while several species of bats possibly may be imperiled — the Indiana bat in particular, is likely to be adversely impacted — other damage would be minimal. EKPC has not publicly addressed the matter of the potential fate of the Indiana bats. 
In the statement, EKPC did however, address concerns about the line marring the viewshed from the Pinnacles, saying the line would be screened largely (but not entirely) by Pilot Knob. In the statement, the utility dodged the questions of how the line might impinge on the bucolic feel of Windswept, the College’s retreat and conference center overlooking Owsley Fork reservoir, also home to an observatory. The College demanded an answer in its response to EKPC’s suit.
The city of Berea had contracted an engineering firm to assess the line’s potential impact on the water quality of the reservoir, the source for the city’s water. The engineering report concluded the line “would not result in a significant enough impact on water quality.” Therefore, EKPC pledged in its statement to follow the firm’s best practices for vegetation management around the transmission lines.
“EKPC is continuing right-of-way acquisition and plans to commence clearing and construction in 2026,” Comer said.

They designed a self-driving rescue vehicle to help. (Photo provided by Clemson University.A group of Clemson University engineering students watched the nonstop news last September as Helene tore a path of death and destruction through the Carolinas and Tennessee.
The raging floodwaters that isolated the storm’s victims prompted them to question: What if a team of medics could have driven into mountain towns and far-flung homesteads with a Humvee loaded with supplies? And what if they could have sent the vehicle back on its own to transport injured and rescued passengers?
That was the inspiration behind the latest research project conducted by students in the Upstate university’s Deep Orange program.
A team of 17 students equipped a self-driving vehicle that could be deployed by search and rescue teams.
 A self-driving rescue vehicle was the 16th project of Clemson University’s Deep Orange program. (Photo provided by Clemson University.)
“This is really important, because in a rescue situation, you obviously want to get to people as quickly as possible. And if you have any injured people, you want to get them out of harm’s way as quickly as possible,” said automotive engineering professor Rob Prucka. “So that’s the kind of work that we’re trying to do.”
Prucka is the director of the Deep Orange program, which has an ongoing, autonomous vehicle research partnership with the U.S. Army.
The project, completed this past spring, marks the 16th iteration of Deep Orange, in which industry leaders give each cohort of students a problem to solve during the course of their studies.
That’s why the vehicle was dubbed Deep Orange 16.
“Deep Orange pushes us to think like real-world engineers,” said team leader Rohit Godse, who graduated in August with a master’s degree in automotive engineering. “We are not just learning theory, but solving complex, high-stakes problems that prepare us to lead in the industry from day one.”
“We’re trying to produce engineers that will be valuable to the auto industry the day they leave Clemson,” Prucka added.
The program also seeks to test technological advancements that automakers or the military may one day use — in this case, a rescue vehicle controlled by software that could be used in combat or stateside during a natural disaster.
One thing Prucka said the team heard over and over from first responders they interviewed is many never know the situation they’re walking into until they get there. They have maybe half the information they need. And it may or may not be correct. So, they need a vehicle that’s ready for anything.
“And maybe the car itself could be an extra helping hand,” Prucka said.
One of the new capabilities the team added to the off-road vehicle included camera systems for looking ahead and sensors for scanning the ground. The vehicle could then use its computing systems to analyze those images and readings on the fly and automatically adjust its suspension accordingly to create a smoother ride.
Those same camera and sensor systems also map the route in, so the vehicle can travel back out without someone controlling it from the driver’s seat.
And in off-road situations, visibility becomes an added challenge.
“If you crest a hill, you can’t usually see over the hill,” Prucka said. “If you’re in a really rocky train, you can’t always tell what exactly a tire is going to run over.”
A 360-degree view from the cameras reduces the number of blind spots operators might have.

Finally, while less high tech, students designed a stretcher-loading mechanism for the back of the vehicle to lift injured passengers.
“On the surface it looks simple in a way,” Prucka said. “But it’s intentional because the soldiers all said this thing needs to work every time. It can’t be complicated. But it does help some challenges that they have actually loading patients into the vehicle, especially, when they’re under distress.”
“Our students are not only driving innovation — they’re helping to save lives by improving how we respond to emergencies in the most challenging environments,” Prucka added.
Deep Orange 16 will remain at Clemson as a prototype.
Future classes will continue to test and improve the technology that could eventually be used in rescue operations.

This story was originally published by Canary Media.
A new state law set to take effect next month marks the end of New Hampshire’s flirtation with offshore wind — at least for now.


The measure, signed into law by Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte, shortens the name of the Office of Offshore Wind Industry Development and Energy Innovation to simply the Office of Energy Innovation. As the name change suggests, the legislation also removes the office’s mandate to support offshore wind development, and dissolves two efforts to create workforce training programs and develop ports serving the offshore wind industry.


“It’s definitely discouraging, practically and symbolically, when it comes to our region moving toward offshore wind as a meaningful part of the energy mix,” said Mireille Bejjani, co-executive director of New England-based environmental advocacy group Slingshot.


The move comes as President Donald Trump attempts to stop the emerging offshore wind industry in its tracks. On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order pausing all permitting and lease sales for new projects, and in the months that followed his administration has attempted to halt the construction of fully permitted offshore wind developments, including, most recently, the nearly complete Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island.
R.I. leaders want Revolution Wind stop work order reversed. And they want it now.



Other governors in New England, a region that has been counting on offshore wind for climate action and grid reliability, have been resolute in pushing projects forward. In fact, every coastal New England state aside from New Hampshire is party to a lawsuit seeking to overturn Trump’s offshore wind executive order.


The law marks a shift from the stance taken by previous governor, Republican Chris Sununu, who was in office from 2017 to 2025.


Swing state New Hampshire has long been a libertarian-leaning outlier in deeply Democratic New England. On climate and energy issues, New Hampshire has generally been less aggressive than neighboring states: It doesn’t have legally mandated greenhouse gas reduction targets, has pulled back on energy-efficiency goals and programming, and recently all but drained its renewable energy fund to pay for other state needs.











Offshore wind has the potential to realize many positive economic, energy, and environmental impacts for New Hampshire and our neighboring states.


– Former Gov. Chris Sununu




For a time, however, the state seemed on the verge of embracing offshore wind. In 2019, Sununu asked the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to convene a task force to facilitate regional cooperation and discussion about the potential for wind development in the Gulf of Maine. The next year, the state created a commission to study offshore wind and port development, and in 2021 the Office of Offshore Wind Industry Development and Energy Innovation was formed and funded. In 2022, the state released an in-depth report that found offshore wind could accelerate the reduction of carbon emissions and create good-paying jobs.


“Offshore wind has the potential to realize many positive economic, energy, and environmental impacts for New Hampshire and our neighboring states,” Sununu wrote in the introduction to the report.


This year’s legislative session, however, saw a flurry of bills aimed at keeping the New Hampshire government out of the business of offshore wind. One proposal even sought to ban its development outright.


The recently signed law is less aggressive, pulling away from offshore wind without prohibiting it. To soften the blow further, the state Senate, led by Democratic state Sen. David Watters, amended the legislation to make it clear that the energy innovation office would still have the authority to do work related to offshore wind if interest is revived in the future.

“The bill as it finally passed still kept a toehold in state government for being able to respond to or prepare for future offshore wind development,” Watters said.


During the legislative process, however, it was clear that many interested parties saw the bill as a referendum on offshore wind in general, not merely the structure of government offices and committees. Public comments during a House hearing on the bill in February dwelled heavily on the perceived dangers of offshore wind, including potential threats to wildlife, possible hikes in electricity prices, and concerns about the intermittent nature of wind power.


The movement against offshore wind, observers said, is driven by a mix of national conservative hostility toward renewable energy and New Hampshire’s unique character. The state Senate is reasonably open to renewables, Watters said. However, the 400-member House — the largest state legislative body in the country, by a wide margin — is far more averse, he said.


Furthermore, the state has always been fiscally conservative, priding itself on its lack of sales and personal income taxes. It was always unlikely to offer tax incentives, like neighboring states, or take the risk of getting locked into a power purchase agreement at prices that could exceed market rates, said Sam Evans-Brown, executive director of Clean Energy New Hampshire.


“New Hampshire was never going to be the state that drove the offshore wind industry,” he said.


Still, some clean energy advocates are concerned that the offshore wind law is a troublesome step backwards when the state needs to be charging ahead on renewables. There is widespread agreement that New England needs more power supply to help control soaring electricity prices and maintain grid reliability. At the same time, observers said, restraints on natural gas supplies make more gas-fired power generation unlikely, and building new nuclear facilities would be contentious; either option would take years to begin sending electrons into the grid.


Now, the Trump administration continues to throw up as many roadblocks as possible to offshore wind, potentially scuttling what may be the region’s best — and speediest — chance to build large-scale energy generation.


It makes no sense to let ideological objections to renewable energy get in the way of considering all available resources, said Nick Krakoff, senior attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation.


“They’ll say they are for all-of-the-above energy, but don’t even want to consider offshore wind,” he said. ​“They’re not really looking at the full picture.”


For others, the new law is a reasonable response to political realities in New Hampshire. If the state was never going to be a major supporter of offshore wind, it makes sense to focus the Office of Energy Innovation on measures that might actually have a fighting chance, Evans-Brown said, pointing to microgrids, battery developments, demand-flexibility programs, and electrification as promising options that would help the state make the most of the power production it has.


Advocates and policymakers across the board, however, are holding on to hope that while the state explores other courses of action, the development of offshore wind is merely delayed.
“I do think [it] is likely to come back,” Watters said. ​“But I am a very pragmatic legislator: We’re just going to have to have a pause on offshore wind.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/point-judith-RI-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-02 05:56:59.130617

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)We are living in the age of cowards, and it started even before Donald Trump sealed his reelection.
September marks one year since I had the misfortune of witnessing University of Kentucky President Eli Capilouto and other top university presidents get their heads handed to them in an Interim Joint Committee on Education. Their task over two long hours? To placate, to ensure our GOP supermajority in Frankfort that any whiff of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) had already been stripped from university governance and class syllabi.
Near the end of the meeting, I checked my phone to see that Ricky L. Jones — a professor from the University of Louisville who was also in the audience — had posted on his social media, “The McCarthyite Committee has now called the Presidents of Eastern Kentucky, Western Kentucky, and Murray State to all testify at once. They’re being handled like the B-Team. On another note, ONE of the THREE Black legislators just returned to the room.”
Jones was right. From the sneering arrogance of Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, one of the main interrogators, to the timidity of the university presidents in the spotlight, everything about that meeting felt un-American and disgusting. And it was equally crushing to see many of our elected officials up there on panel, who surely know better, barely push back.
Where, I wondered, was their courage? Where were our leaders?
The issues of missing courage and absent leadership have grown exponentially worse since President Donald Trump took office, again, in January.
From Washington D.C. to Kentucky, the sycophantic stranglehold this one man has on the leaders we deem most powerful has been shocking to see. 










It is like watching all of the dominoes loudly fall and wondering who is going to do the work to, one by one, stand them upright again.


Where are the officials — in Kentucky and all over the country — that we elected to Congress to represent OUR interests? By all reports, most of them are in absentia, avoiding constituent town halls back home like vampires in sunlight while cheering on the president from behind the safe space of their social media feeds.
As men like Daniel Cameron, Nate Morris and Andy Barr fight harder for the Trump endorsement than they do for the votes of Kentuckians, we should consider whom exactly they intend on serving if awarded a six-year U.S. Senate term — the 4.5 million citizens they represent or the tyrant in the Oval Office who can, with a tweet, destroy their careers?
Do our representatives work for us or for the president?
We get the answer to that question every day.
Congress was sent home early for their summer break to avoid dealing with potential shockwaves in the Epstein files. The Federal Emergency Management Agency suspended staff who dared to criticize the president over what they deemed dangerous cuts. The president fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics hours after a weaker-than-expected jobs report because the numbers did not adhere to the fantasy he’s peddling to Americans that jobs are on the rise because of his immigration crackdown. He has shaken down some of this nation’s most lauded universities claiming, without proof, that they have been “infested with radicalism.”
The president now claims, in opposition to statistics, there is a violent crime emergency in our nation’s capital to justify deployment and federalization of National Guard troops from a number of red states to Washington D.C. and has threatened to do the same in other Democratic-led cities, even at the refusal of those states’ governors.
The last time I was in Washington D.C., I met up with friends from the U.S. Army War College who worked at the Pentagon. We took a nighttime boat ride on the Potomac so they could show me the monuments lit up from the water; we grabbed beers at a pub in Georgetown; we peeked inside the office of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs who was, that minute, arriving outside via black SUV motorcade so we had to be quick.
I would not make that trip to Washington D.C. today. In a lifetime of U.S. and international travel, I’ve learned that a basic rule of thumb is that it is unsafe to be in any city occupied by armed military. The president, in his unhinged marketing blitz to make himself look like a strongman, has made local law enforcement look like ninnies and effectively warned tourists (and the money they spend) to stay away.
And yet, he remains unchallenged by anyone who could stop him.
 Sen. Robby Mills chimed in on X to support Trump’s stand against mail-in voting.
In a testament to today’s rampant toadyism, even Republicans in leadership at the Kentucky legislature are quick to tout any Trump talking point in order to grab his gaze.
State Sen. Robby Mills — former candidate for lieutenant governor and current Senate majority caucus chair — recently posted a Trump video about mail-in ballots and wrote, in part, “I stand with President Trump…it’s time to end mail-in voting! I am not referring to absentee voting, which KY has and is controled [sic] and secured through an electronic portal. I am referring to the states that mail every registered voter a ballot and allows for ballot harvesting. This must end!”
Kentucky does not have mail-in voting. 
I am unaware of any plans by our secretary of state to introduce mail-in voting. 
So why is Mills so publicly het up (“This must end!”) about something that is not happening here and falls completely outside the purview of his office?
Because Mills knows what all those in power know: Publicly fawning and praising and sucking up to the current occupant of the Oval Office every chance they get (see how Cameron, Morris and Barr are behaving in their Senate runs) will either keep them in power or get them there.
The story of Kentucky’s university presidents being hauled to Frankfort for a humiliating spanking last September was an advance-notice reality check. That meeting did feel McCarthyite, and yet we all treated it as normal. It was one of many signs to come that — whether it be a university president making big money or a lawmaker in state or federal government — we are witnessing abject cowardice in our leaders on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis.
It is like watching all of the dominoes loudly fall and wondering who is going to do the work to, one by one, stand them upright again.
Everyone keeps asking: Where are the Democrats? What are the Democrats doing? What is their plan, their platform, their social media game plan, etc…? 
We are wasting time, and we are asking all the wrong questions. 
In this age of categorical, across the board, capitulation and cowardice — as a 78 year-old man, wearing a red hat in the Oval Office, denigrates the free press while exercising his stranglehold on everyone from billionaires to business executives to lawmakers to military leaders to university presidents — we are a population desperate for those with real courage, real convictions and real voices to reveal themselves. No matter their political party.
How much longer will we have to wait?
How much of who we are as Americans will be irreparably destroyed before we rebuild?
Where in the hell are our leaders?

Left to right are Kendra Gay, Lexy Bulman, and Co-Director Jim Corwin. (Photo by Julia Steiny/Rhode Island Current)When lunch winds down at Garvin Elementary School in Cumberland, the kids take their trays to the food recycling line. They sort their lunch detritus into well-marked bins and buckets. A fifth grade “food waste ranger” oversees the process, monitoring what goes into which container to avoid contaminating the contents. 
The line starts at a table for food that could be redistributed — unopened milk cartons, power bars, wrapped cheese sticks — and a basket for intact fruit and vegetables. If kids are still hungry, they can pick up something extra there thanks to support from the RI School Recycling Project.  Every one of the 52 schools that participated in the program last year received a refrigerator to store perishables. That food is distributed to hungry students and food insecure families, who are about 30% of Rhode Island’s population. (School staff who are close to the families stock backpacks for those they know need help.)
Next, students move past the waste-collection station which has a bucket for pouring leftover liquids, along with a bin marked “recycle” with pictures of what can be recycled, and another for trash that can’t go anywhere but the Central Landfill in Johnston, like plastic bags and straws. The last stop collects food scraps — apple cores and banana peels that will go to the school’s commercial composting partner. A few schools make their own compost.
On the day I visited Garvin at the end of May, it was “zero waste” day, so kids were especially jazzed because a completely empty, sorted tray earned them a sticker and maybe a prize, like a T-shirt. 
Lest this seems like a cool but small stakes school activity, consider this: 
In the 2023-2024 school year, preliminary data from 42 of the participating schools shows that more than 227 tons of food waste was diverted. Each school does its own waste audit.
According to Anthesis Global: One ton of Co2 is equivalent to the electricity consumption of 0.65 average households for a year. Driving a gasoline car for 5,000 miles. Taking 72 high-speed train trips of 300 miles each. 2.6 round-trip flights between New York and Miami. Rescuing Leftover Cuisine says that 227 tons is the equivalent of 35,000 meals. 
More than greenhouse gases, though, the kids focus on Rhode Island’s one and only landfill run by the Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation (RIRRC). A 2015 report warned that the landfill was filling so quickly, it would close in 2038. For the record, Connecticut’s landfills are already full, so the state sends about 40% of their solid waste to Ohio or Pennsylvania at a cost of just under $100 million a year. Rhode Island could be in the same boat in the not-too-distant future.
Since that report came out a decade ago, efforts including this one by the RI School Recycling Project have bought the state more time, extending the state landfill’s closure date to 2045. 
In response to pleas from the quasi-public agency that operates the landfill, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed a law in 2014 banning food waste, but with caveats.. Unfortunately, the law was another toothless unfunded mandate, like much of education legislation. But partner agencies and philanthropies generously stepped in to fund the RI School Recycling Project.
Back in Garvin’s lunchroom, the vigilant food-waste fifth grader minding the stations, told me his interest was “To keep the landfill from filling up.”
“This way we can stay here and not put a landfill in our town,” he added.
Of course, Cumberland is under no such threat. But the project pays for second-year student rangers to take a field trip to the top of the garbage mountain where they gape at its impressive quantity. The Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation education staff teach students about the realities of mindlessly tossing solid waste. (You can take that tour too.) 










The vigilant food-waste fifth grader minding the stations, told me his interest was 'To keep the landfill from filling up.'


The corporation developed a curriculum for young people about methane, its toxic effects, and about greenhouse gasses in general. Students learn that on any given school day in Rhode Island, just under 28,000 pounds of compostable food goes into the landfill. Of that, 4,000 pounds is food that is perfectly fine and could be redistributed. Tiny Rhode Island’s public schools generate 5 million pounds of food waste a year.
Teachers adapt curricula to build on what students are learning from this real life experience, including having the kids collect the data to calculate the waste audit.
Furthermore, the project saves money. Redirecting the recyclables reduces the number of dumpsters the school needs, along with the tipping fees for the landfill. Warren Heyman, the project’s operations director, said a Warwick school was putting a dozen bags of trash a day into its dumpster. 
“On the first day we implemented our program, the school only took out two bags of trash, around 10 pounds,” Heyman said. “That’s 50 fewer bags a week. That’s one less full dumpster of trash a week.”
Granting agencies are so enthused about this work, they’ve recently given enough money to bring on another 50 schools in the new school year that begins Tuesday in Cumberland for first through ninth grade students. All grades are in session Wednesday.
The money pays for the skeletal, part-time staff of two, Co-Director Jim Corwin, and Heyman, plus stipends for volunteers. The project welcomes volunteers to help them double their reach. 
Training sessions for interested volunteers began last week.To learn more, contact Heyman by filling out the contact form on the project’s website. 
The project offers educational materials and techniques to help schools get started and stay active. Also covered are the fridges, field trips, containers, prizes and the fees for composting companies to take the food scraps. (See available companies on page 15 of this presentation.) 
After a well-deserved rest, Corwin and Heyman had a super busy summer. They’ve got their hands full, but they dearly hope grocery stores and restaurants catch the recycling bug.
If the kids can do it, so can they.

Even before the global health crisis, passengers were often unable to determine a train’s arrival time or which side of the tracks to board, creating chaos and prompting volunteers to step onto the tracks to help look for lights or signs of the next locomotive. 
“They’re coming into my visitor center for help, and I’m not going to turn them away,” said Novak, the center’s manager. “I need to help them and that’s part of what we do.”
After years of coordination and effort, the Passenger Information Display System (PIDS) has debuted, designed to inform passengers using the Ashland and Richmond Main Street stations — neither of which has in-person staff — about upcoming trains through displays and a speaker system. As part of the system, Amtrak will notify passengers of updates from its PIDS Operations Center between the two stations at Richmond Staples Mill.

PIDS provides customers with real-time information on train arrivals and departures, as well as track assignments, in both audible and visual formats, Amtrak said in March when it announced the upgrades at the Main Street Station. The system can also announce essential update information during service disruptions and includes an adaptive sound system that adjusts to different environmental noise levels.
As of March 28, Virginia stations equipped with PIDS include Lynchburg, Newport News, Norfolk, Petersburg, Williamsburg, and the Staples Mill Road Station in Richmond. Amtrak Virginia trains offer direct service to the Main Street Station to and from Newport News, Northern Virginia, Washington, D.C., and as far north as Boston, according to the company.
“Amtrak is committed to providing timely and accurate customer communications across all channels – in stations, on board trains, via our mobile apps and our various web-based platforms,” said David Handera, Amtrak vice president of accessibility and Stations & facilities Chief Administrative Officer, in a March statement. “Thanks to VPRA, the City of Richmond and our dedicated, multi-departmental team for this modern and accessible system that will enhance the travel experience.”
 Improving public safety, ridership experience

The Virginia Passenger Rail Authority, which manages the commonwealth’s state-supported Amtrak Virginia passenger rail service, has worked with the transit provider on the upgrades to enhance public safety and improve the ridership experience.
“If people have proper information, that is going to reduce the possibility that someone could have a safety incident on the tracks,” said Mike McLaughlin, VPRA’s chief operating officer.
At the Ashland station, McLaughlin said passengers are unable to cross to the other side of the track once a train has arrived, which is why information about where the train will arrive is essential.
In comparison, at the Fredericksburg train stop, travelers can use an underpass to walk underneath the tracks. However, it can still be challenging for those who need more time to board.
Ensuring passengers have up-to-date information was another priority, McLaughlin said.
“We live in the 21st century, where people come to appreciate that and people come to expect that, and the customer needs that information,” McLaughlin said.
Knowing their train’s arrival time can also help passengers manage their time better and determine if they have enough spare time to grab a snack or pop into a nearby shop, which is a potential revenue booster for local businesses.
“I think it does go hand in hand that the more information that people have, the more they can make the best use of their time,” McLaughlin said. “If the best use of your time is (visiting) a business across the street, whether it be a coffee shop or something of that nature, that’s a win-win for everyone.”
 More riders get on board

VPRA and its partners’ efforts to boost interest in trains statewide have led to an increase in ridership across all rail corridors in Virginia, including Ashland and Richmond in the central region of the state.
In July, Amtrak Virginia reached a milestone, welcoming 131,743 passengers, marking the highest ridership for that month and the second-highest overall since the state-supported service began in 2009. The record for the highest monthly ridership remains 136,433, set in December 2024.
The increase in ridership has benefitted the tourism industry, including businesses and local amenities.
“(The upgrades) represent a huge leap forward — technology and safety-wise — based on what we were dealing with, which was nothing except the best guess of our very gracious staff,” said Martha Miller, assistant town manager in Ashland. “So the town is incredibly excited to have these new displays.”

Miller said the town will need to find adequate parking during special events due to the increase in ridership.
In Richmond, Katherine O’Donnell, president and CEO of Richmond Region Tourism, applauded VPRA and Amtrak’s investment in the city, which she said will also help support tourism in the region.
“Whether guests are arriving for business or exploring our historic sites, having clear, real-time travel information ensures a welcoming and stress-free experience,” O’Donnell said in a statement to the Mercury. “Main Street Station and Ashland are important gateways into our community, and improvements like these reinforce the Richmond Region as a connected, accessible, and visitor-friendly destination.”
Novak has retired her trusty binoculars — given to her by her husband after she shared her previous method of trying to spot trains while helping passengers with mobility challenges or children — and will retire herself in October after 19 years at the visitor center. As a new era of train travel emerges, she reflected on the role they have played in Ashland’s culture.
“When I sit back and think about it, we were very intertwined with Amtrak,” Novak said. “It just happened that way because of so many people. On some days, we would have anywhere from 50 to 100 people come through here in one day. That’s a lot for a small town, and for us and a good portion of (visitors), it has something to do with the train.”

In some of his first public comments since being shot in an attempted assassination, Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman urged fellow lawmakers to refocus on the true purpose of public service.
“We can’t let the evil of the night win, and we must redouble our efforts and reclaim the reason we are all public servants,” he said.
That means listening to one another, extending understanding even in disagreement, and finding compromise: “not because it’s easy, but because the people we serve deserve better than constant stalemate built on partisan egos. They deserve solutions.”
Hoffman appeared via video message before thousands of lawmakers and staffers gathered at the National Conference of State Legislatures summit earlier this month in Boston. In June, he and his wife were shot in their Minnesota home just before the politically motivated shooter killed state Rep. Melissa Hortman, the former House speaker, her husband, Mark, and their dog, Gilbert.
The June shooting hung over this year’s meeting of the NCSL, a group that labors to maintain a reputation for bipartisan and nonpartisan work. Lawmakers in attendance on the left and the right repeatedly lamented the toxicity of American politics and the growing threat of political violence at local levels of government.
Many lawmakers raised questions about whether public service is still worth it, how state governments can buck the partisanship that defines Washington, D.C., and what measures lawmakers should take to keep members safe. Most lawmakers said they remained committed to serving, but they said conservatives and liberals must find ways to disagree without demonizing their opposition and do better at monitoring the rhetoric of members of their own parties.

Wisconsin House Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, said the vitriol of social media and cable news has made it more difficult to talk with people of differing beliefs. Technology has reduced the frequency of many human interactions, he said. Even the rise of video doorbells has made it difficult for candidates and officials to talk with everyday constituents in person, as many refuse to answer.
“So instead of knocking on doors and meeting strangers, you have a tendency to go to party events where you are meeting people who want to come and meet you,” he said. “Well, they come from usually one end of the spectrum. They’re people who are probably paying too much attention to politics and not enough to all the other things in the world.”
Author and media personality Michael Smerconish asked Vos whether the current climate pushes good candidates away and incentivizes “zealots” to run.
“That’s a really good point,” Vos responded. “Part of my job is to recruit candidates, and it is very challenging to get people who are willing to put their personal life on the line and convince their family that there is nothing more fun to do on a Sunday morning than to go to a pancake breakfast.”
He said potential candidates are worried about how their kids will be treated in school and what effect running could have on their careers. But he said state governments can model a more civil political tone and show how government works. Even simple moves like holding bipartisan meetings with staff — rather than holding separate caucus meetings — can help to forge more positive relationships.
“We are places where people can disagree, but we don’t have to be hateful,” he said. “And maybe, just maybe, over time we’ll be able to showcase to the rest of the country that that’s the way that legislatures lead.”

 ‘Hold people accountable’

Since the June shooting in Minnesota, liberal and conservative states alike are considering measures to bolster protections for candidates and elected officials.
Legislation proposed in New Jersey would prohibit the publication of home addresses of lawmakers, adding them to a list of protected officials that includes judges and law enforcement. That legislation remains in committee.
ln North Dakota, lawmakers are considering establishing a more formal process for reporting threats, the North Dakota Monitor reported. A North Dakota man was charged in June with sending threatening messages to officials in which he referenced the Minnesota shootings. Legislative staff have already removed the home addresses of lawmakers from the legislative website and are considering providing post office boxes for lawmaker mail and creating new safety training.
Pennsylvania lawmakers will soon introduce a package of bills to boost legislator safety, limit their public exposure and ensure representation if a lawmaker dies while in office, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported.
In Oregon, House Speaker Julie Fahey said lawmakers and staff are thinking more about personal safety. State law doesn’t allow candidates to use campaign funds for security purposes, but the Democratic speaker said the legislature may soon change that.










I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact.


– Oregon House Speaker Julie Fahey, a Democrat


During an NCSL session about the cost of public service, Fahey referenced protesters’ 2020 armed breach of the state Capitol in Salem and noted that she’d had an angry constituent show up at her home.
She said lawmakers and staffers need to talk more about the cost of their work, which can be isolating, especially for those in leadership positions.
“I think it’s really important that we talk about the threats and we talk about the impact,” she said.
Sitting next to her, West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said it’s not just personal safety that weighs on lawmakers.
It’s just as taxing on spouses and families — who he said are “front and center” in any conversation about running for office nowadays.
When he first assumed his leadership position in 2018, Hanshaw said he saw his job as mostly confined to running the chamber and worrying only about the behavior of members in their official capacity. But his thinking has evolved in this political environment, which he said requires modeling and monitoring of personal behavior and online activity of members of his caucus.
“That was the wrong approach,” he told Stateline. “And I would say that to anyone who’s coming into one of these roles: You need to set the example and you need to hold people accountable.”
 ‘What is your why?’

Pennsylvania Democratic House Speaker Joanna McClinton said the current political environment is markedly different because officials at all levels of government can be targets.
“And what we must all collectively do is to condemn the violence, to bring the tone of rhetoric down and out of our capitols, and most importantly let folks know that we can always agree to disagree, but we can never, ever allow there to be violence in discourse,” she said in an interview.

While the climate has not deterred her from serving, McClinton said it does provide an opportunity to underscore the solemnity of public service and helps frame a candidate’s purpose for running and deciding whether it’s worthwhile.
“What is your why?” she said she increasingly asks potential candidates. “What is your purpose? What do you plan to achieve, to accomplish? Why is it that you want to do this?”
Tim Storey, the chief executive officer of NCSL, said state legislatures are more bipartisan than many realize. Even in dogged legislative fights, many bills ultimately pass with support from both sides — or even unanimously.
“There’s a relatively small group who just demonize the other side,” he said in an interview. “I think for the most part, they still see each other as humans who are actually in a really unique job, and so only they can understand each other and the sacrifice and the pressure that gets put on by the public exposure.”
Shock, sadness and resolve in the wake of arson attack on governor’s residence

He said that was especially true following Hortman’s assassination.
“They felt it across the aisle of both parties,” he said.
Storey said NCSL’s Boston summit was a record-breaker with more than 1,600 state lawmakers and thousands more staffers and lobbyists in attendance.
The event kicked off with two of Minnesota’s top legislative leaders — a Democrat and a Republican — on stage in front of a packed ballroom talking about the assassination.
Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth said Hortman had always treated her as a partner rather than an adversary. With mutual trust and respect, they could “disagree without being disagreeable,” she said.
State Sen. Erin Murphy, the Democratic majority leader, said politicians must turn down the vitriol in their rhetoric.
“I think a lot of America would appreciate that. I know Melissa would,” she told the crowd.
But she said lawmakers must also root out dehumanizing narratives and conspiracy theories that have led to the radicalization of so many individuals.
“We can’t lose faith in each other. We can’t lose faith in America,” she said. “As Melissa taught us, failure is not an option.”

(Photo courtesy of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel)As the countdown to this fall’s high-stakes elections continues, advocates are calling on the next governor of Virginia and state lawmakers to continue efforts to protect the Chesapeake Bay from pollution and to work to fight climate change impacts for Virginians and wildlife.
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF), an independent conservation organization, held a press conference last week to discuss ways they hope the next governor will ramp up efforts to protect the bay and continue programs that are already in place. The agency said this election comes at a pivotal time for Virginia, where federal shifts have led to major shakeups including lost flood mitigation and clean energy funding, as House of Delegates and gubernatorial candidates’ priorities take shape. 
“It’s also about making sure that we have drinking water that is clean and ensuring that clean streams and rivers are available for our kids to enjoy for years to come,” said CBF Virginia Executive Director Chris Moore. “It’s also important that we make sure through these efforts, that our homes and our businesses are protected from damaging floods and extreme weather events that are becoming more common here in the Chesapeake Bay region.”
They have put together a five-point action plan to preserve the natural resource that so many in the commonwealth depend on.
 Restoring and protecting waterways

The state of Virginia has been a part of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed agreement for a decade. That agreement between states surrounding the bay aims to reduce the amount of pollution and sediment runoff in the bay, restore habitats for key species, adapt communities to be more climate resilient, and expand education around bay conservation.
One of the Bay Foundation’s recommendations is to make the pilot Pay-For-Outcomes Nonpoint Source Pollution Reduction grant program permanent. Businesses, nonprofits, individuals, or local governments could apply for grants to reduce the amount of nitrogen or phosphorus flowing into the watershed. An initial $20 million had been put toward the one-year program.
CBF also urges the protection and restoration of Virginia’s wetlands that have been steadily shrinking. Recent studies have shown that the state could lose up to 78% of its wetlands by the end of the century due to rising sea levels. Wetlands can be the first line of defense when it comes to storm surge and protecting habitats within the bay.
“That is an unsustainable path, and we have got to turn that trend around, so we are calling on the next administration to take bold action, both legislatively and in the budget to expand the restoration and creation of wetlands, living shorelines, and green spaces,” said Jay Ford, CBF Virginia policy manager.
 Becoming more climate resilient

Virginia faces serious threats from climate change ranging from extreme heat, flooding, powerful storms, and disease. Hampton Roads is especially susceptible to flooding dangers as sea levels rise and rain amounts increase. The next governor’s administration will undoubtedly need to address these issues when she takes office.
In a sit-down interview with the Mercury in August, Democratic nominee for governor Abigail Spanberger said she would return Virginia to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that had been bringing in funds to help with flooding mitigation and other resiliency projects.

Republican gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears had agreed to an interview but canceled it less than an hour before it was scheduled to start, and has not responded to questions about her climate resilience plans or any queries for this story. She has publicly stated her support for the state’s removal from the RGGI program, saying it was an unjust tax on Virginians.
CBF states there should be more resources in place for homeowners to access to make their homes more resilient against flooding and heat. There are also existing agricultural programs to help farmers get grants to plant cover crops and other methods to aid in reducing land erosion that the organization would like to see continue.
“Virginia is simply not prepared for climate change, and the federal government is pulling back at a time we need to be leaning in. Our next governor will need to help us catch up and make Virginia a national leader on climate adaptation,” Ford said.
Earle-Sears has not clearly laid out an agenda for climate resiliency or flood mitigation, but she has remarked on her “all of the above” energy policy, which does include building out fossil fuel infrastructure as part of the plan.
 Safeguarding Virginia’s diverse landscape

Virginia boasts forestland, mountains, and coastal elements to its rich landscape. CBF would like the next governor and General Assembly to modernize the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act. The law gives the Department of Environmental Quality the authority to review state and federal projects to ensure they are built in a manner that preserves water quality. The law was last amended in 2022.
“We’d like to see it include more stringent conditions for allowing building in or removal of the CBPA buffers in the future,” Ford said. “This is just a recognition of the changes that are coming with climate change as these waters continue to move further up the shoreline.”
As forestland and wetlands are impacted by climate change, the CBF also wants to see an expansion of programs to protect tree canopies while respecting local authority under the Dillon rule. 
 Invest in farmers

The General Assembly has continued to increase the amount of funding for a grant program that allows farmers to opt in to sustainable farming measures to cut down on pollutants. This year, $223 million was put into the program. Farmers can apply for up to $300,000 in cost-share funds to select from 60 different projects all aimed at protecting water quality in the bay.
“The Commonwealth should work with the farmers and a research community to identify and target pollution hotspots that are prone to discharging excess nutrients,” Ford said. “The water runs off the land differently, all over the place, and we have the great tools available to us now to know how we can best deploy these limited tax dollars and make sure Virginia’s getting the most bang for our buck.”
Spanberger served in the U.S. House Agriculture Committee and chaired the Conservation and Forestry subcommittee and is keen to continue that type of work in the commonwealth. 
“Abigail brought Virginia producers, business owners, and community leaders together to strengthen voluntary conservation programs. Abigail supports strengthening voluntary, state-level programs to help Virginia farmers and producers reduce runoff and improve water quality,” a spokesperson for the Spanberger campaign said.
 Hold polluters accountable

CBF said the next administration must take a serious step towards managing PFAS, or forever chemicals, and microplastics that pose a serious threat to the Chesapeake Bay and other waterways in the state. Amid federal rollbacks of policies aimed at reducing pollution and emissions, CBF said it is time for the state to step in and ramp up. 
A Spanberger spokesperson said she has met with the CBF and others about this and will “make sure conservation efforts are working as intended, and that businesses are following the law,” if she is elected. 
Ford said there has been wide support for clean water initiatives, however, many lawmakers and local governments have differing ideas on what they feel is the best way to manage water quality. He said their organization has struggled the most in making headway in the General Assembly around the management of PFAS.
“The longer answer is the devils in the details, and we need to make sure we get everyone swimming in the same direction on these items, and that’s why we’re trying to jump out early before we’ve had an election, before we know who our new governor (and) a new general assembly is, and really set a roadmap for them to follow over the next couple of years,” Ford said.

Kennedy Jr. is targeting the government’s Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, without which manufacturers might cease producing shots. (Eric Harkleroad/KFF  Health News)Dining under palm trees on a patio at Mar-a-Lago in December, President-elect Donald Trump reassured chief executives at pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly and Pfizer that anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wouldn’t be a radical choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services.
“I think he’s going to be much less radical than you would think,” Trump said later that month during a news conference at his Palm Beach, Florida, resort.
Eight months have passed, and Kennedy is intensifying his attacks on the vaccine system.
High on his list of targets: a federal vaccine compensation program that settles injury claims. His strategy could bankrupt or diminish the fund, some legal scholars and public health leaders say, saddling pharmaceutical companies with liability risks and costs that would compel them to stop making vaccines altogether.
“It’s a radical agenda,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. “He’s using a bunch of different mechanisms and there really are no guardrails. People are going to catch on but it’s not going to be enough to stop the waves of deaths, and deaths of children.”
Kennedy has said changes to the U.S. vaccine system are needed because, he asserts without evidence, immunizations are linked to autism, neurotoxicity, allergies, and death. He is a leader of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement, an informal campaign that eschews traditional medicine and espouses “medical freedom.” Many adherents oppose vaccines and believe they are unsafe despite scientific evidence to the contrary.
Kennedy has acknowledged he wants to reform the vaccine fund, known as the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, writing July 28 on the social platform X that “the VICP is broken, and I intend to fix it.” HHS is working with the Department of Justice to revamp the program, which shields drugmakers from most liability over injuries.
HHS didn’t respond to a request to speak with Kennedy, but agency officials said he isn’t opposed to immunizations.
“Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine — he is pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability,” HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano said in an email.
Yet behind the scenes, Kennedy has been laying the groundwork to restrict the availability of widely used immunizations, according to people familiar with internal discussions who asked not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak on the topic.
A multipronged strategy
The strategy began taking shape in the spring. The first step: Raise unfounded questions about the safety of vaccines. At a Cabinet meeting in April, Kennedy told Trump that HHS was undertaking a massive study that would identify the cause of rising autism diagnoses by September.
Kennedy tasked David Geier, a researcher who’s repeated the debunked claim that vaccines cause autism, to oversee the work, according to media reports.
Kennedy then doubled down by questioning the use of aluminum, which is added to many vaccines to help boost the immune response. He linked it to allergies at a July meeting of governors, even though a recent study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found no connection. He’s widely expected to ask a federal vaccine advisory committee to conduct a review.
The autism research and concerns about aluminum were early salvos in the push to go after the compensation fund, according to two of the people.
That fund provides money to people for injuries from vaccines and has paid out more than $5 billion since it was established in 1988, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration.
Before filing a lawsuit in court, injured individuals bring their claims to the program’s nonjury vaccine court, which reviews evidence. The fund provides compensation from a small excise tax on vaccines.
Compensation is determined in part by a table maintained by HRSA and overseen by the HHS secretary. It lists each vaccine and associated injuries and encompasses routine vaccinations recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that are subject to the excise tax. The injuries include anaphylaxis and encephalitis. People who experience such injuries within a certain time after getting a specific vaccine can get money.
Kennedy wants to get autism or allergies added to that document, according to two people familiar with internal discussions and concerns raised publicly by some vaccine developers and former regulators. He could accomplish the goal if HHS-led research blames vaccines for autism, for example, or if a federal vaccine advisory panel recommends against aluminum in vaccines, according to some legal scholars.
“Given the rate of autism, if a lot of cases are brought, that could bankrupt the program,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor at University of California Law San Francisco.
If that were to happen, pharmaceutical companies could stop producing the immunizations, which don’t tend to be very profitable, rather than get entangled in drawn-out, expensive lawsuits from claimants who can’t get money because the federal vaccine injury fund has run dry, some legal experts and vaccine developers said.
“The compensation fund, if it’s gone, would impact decisions to proceed or not to proceed,” said David Dodd, president and CEO of GeoVax Labs, a biotechnology company developing vaccines and immunotherapies.
A federal vaccine advisory panel could also recommend against aluminum in shots, forcing drugmakers to make costly reformulations or exit the market.
Kennedy has placed people around him to execute the strategy. He’s pushed to get vaccine skeptics in decision-making positions at the CDC, which recommends vaccines, and the Food and Drug Administration, which approves them.
He also tapped leaders in the anti-vaccine movement to vet candidates for him.
The outcome has been regulatory and policy decisions that have winnowed vaccine access and development.
HHS this month said it was halting $500 million in grants and contracts for the development of mRNA vaccines, including an improved, more durable covid mRNA vaccine.
The federal government stopped recommending covid shots for healthy pregnant women and children, bypassing input from a vaccine advisory committee that traditionally would have weighed in.
And Kennedy reconstituted that committee with his own handpicked members, including vaccine skeptics, and removed the American Medical Association, American Nurses Association, and other industry groups that served as committee liaisons. The modified panel recommended against flu vaccines containing a preservative erroneously linked to autism.
The White House calls
Kennedy’s determination to keep vaccine skeptics in oversight positions played out in a deal he recently made with Trump and his staff, according to two people familiar with the situation. The arrangement came together on a Sunday night in July when Kennedy got a call from the White House.
The subject was Vinay Prasad, a top vaccine regulator at the FDA. He had recently touched off a wave of industry criticism for playing a role in the agency’s decision to ask biotech company Sarepta Therapeutics to halt shipments of a gene therapy over safety concerns.
Social media posts and conservative commentators whipped up a furor. Laura Loomer, a far-right provocateur, said July 21 on X that Prasad should be fired and called him “a self-proclaimed progressive liberal and Bernie Sanders fanboy,” referring to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Congressional lawmakers began peppering the White House with questions.
The furor reached Trump, who wanted Prasad out, according to the people. But Kennedy was concerned about losing Prasad. He felt he needed a critic of immunizations overseeing vaccines at the agency.
So Kennedy struck a deal. Prasad would be asked to resign as head of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which regulates vaccine products and biologics such as gene therapies. And the center would be divided into two operations, with Kennedy empowered to select the person overseeing vaccines.
Some public health leaders publicly shared details of the arrangement and raised concerns about its potential impact. Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in an Aug. 1 interview on CNBC that he thought it “would be very destructive to the agency.”
After leaving the agency in July, Prasad is now returning, though it is unclear if his role has changed.
Recently, Kennedy was sued by Ray Flores, senior outside counsel for Children’s Health Defense. An anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy, Children’s Health Defense is funding the suit, which claims Kennedy failed to launch a task force to study vaccine safety that it says is required to report findings to Congress. But Kennedy and his allies view the lawsuit as friendly, according to one person familiar with the matter, because it is seeking an outcome that he wants.
HHS on Aug. 14 announced it was reviving a federal panel, disbanded in 1998, to provide oversight of pediatric vaccines.
Kennedy’s work against vaccines has triggered unfriendly lawsuits too, including one brought by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other public health groups. His recent decision to halt funds for mRNA vaccine development yielded a swell of social media criticism.
“This is reckless. This is dangerous. This will cost lives. We must fight back,” Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) said Aug. 5 on X.
“I’ve tried to be objective & non-alarmist in response to current HHS actions – but quite frankly this move is going to cost lives,” Jerome Adams, who was U.S. surgeon general during the previous Trump administration, said Aug. 5 on the same platform.
Kennedy and his backers remain undeterred. In a counterpunch, his supporters are launching an unprecedented public relations campaign to promote the HHS secretary, spurring speculation that he may be mulling a 2028 presidential run.
The nonprofit MAHA Action held a call in July to energize Kennedy supporters and initiated a six-figure ad campaign extolling Kennedy and Trump administration health initiatives.
“Make no mistake, this is a revolution that will change the face of public health policy,” Tony Lyons, president of MAHA Action, said in a statement. “Americans are demanding radical transparency and gold standard science.”

Comprehensive consumer privacy laws are taking effect in eight states this year. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)This year, comprehensive privacy laws are going into effect in eight states to regulate how businesses handle digital information and to give consumers more protections over their personal data.
The laws in Delaware, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Tennessee have taken effect already this year, according to a database from the International Association of Privacy Professionals’ Westin Research Center. Maryland’s privacy law, signed by Democratic Gov. Wes Moore last year, will go into effect Oct. 1.
Privacy laws enacted in Indiana, Kentucky and Rhode Island will go into effect next year.
Several other states are considering comprehensive privacy bills during this year’s legislative sessions. They include Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
When a person visits a website, applies to a job or logs into an online portal, they may be sharing their personal information. Comprehensive privacy laws can apply to a wide range of companies that participate in this kind of data collection.
These laws generally include two types of provisions — those related to consumer rights and those that establish business obligations, according to the association.
Under each of the new laws, consumers have the right to control when and how their data is collected and shared. Some of those provisions include the right to delete data from a company’s database, the ability to opt out of sharing sensitive information and the right to prohibit a company from selling their data.
The new measures also require businesses to ask consumers if they want to opt in to data collection. In some states, businesses are required to complete consumer data risk assessments and identify ways in which discrimination could take place. Some companies also may be required to limit to how consumer data is processed.
In 2018, California became the first state to enact comprehensive privacy legislation for consumers in the state; the law went into effect in 2020. Virginia and Colorado enacted laws in 2021. Connecticut, Montana, Oregon, Texas and Utah also have comprehensive laws that have taken effect, the database shows.
Other states have passed measures with more specific data protections this year. California, Colorado and Montana, for instance, passed legislation that aims to protect sensitive brain data collected by devices outside of medical settings, KFF Health News reported earlier this year.
One bill under consideration in New York would establish data privacy protections for children. And another measure in Pennsylvania aims to improve consumer data protections with genetic testing companies.
Without comprehensive federal protections, state lawmakers are driving the push to protect consumers from having their personal information shared without their knowledge.

(Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)Going to the polls with my parents as a kid is seared into my brain. It’s one of those New Hampshire kid memories that sticks with you: adults waiting in line and murmuring, bake sales with limitless banana bread, neighbors crossing out names with rulers.
It was probably 2004 when my mom discovered a discrepancy between her name on her license and her name on her voter registration. One included her middle name, which had been her maiden name before marrying my dad. The other didn’t.
So at (probably) 11, I learned the word “affidavit.” Since my mom’s identity couldn’t be fully documented on the spot — like countless voters on Election Day — she signed a legally-binding affidavit attesting to her name. She could (and did) follow up with the Secretary of State’s office with additional documents.
Plain old New Hampshire efficiency. The presumption was that my mom was a legitimate voter unless proven otherwise.
Not so anymore.
Our state has a new slate of voting laws that cut against the Granite State tradition of practical access. Had they been on the books 20 years ago, my mom probably wouldn’t have been able to vote that Election Day. Anyone with a similar story will want to head to their local clerk’s office now — or they may not be able to vote this election season.










Some call the passage of these laws “election integrity.” All I see is the government making it harder for people to vote – especially women, senior citizens, college students, immigrants, and folks with disabilities.


Before leaving office, Gov. Chris Sununu signed House Bill 1569, making New Hampshire the first state in the country to require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote. Now, name variations like my mom’s throw up barriers to the ballot. Even small shifts — dropping a middle name, hyphenating a surname, reverting to a maiden name — can block registration if names don’t match across required documents. 
No affidavit. No presumption of good faith. No trust in the voter — or in the local officials who used to help sort this out.
And absentee voters aren’t exempt. This past August, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed two bills — SB 218 and SB 287 — requiring absentee voters to submit the same documentation now required in person. That means every absentee registration must include proof of citizenship, age, New Hampshire residence, and identity. Oh, and every time you request a ballot, you have to include a copy of your ID. Or a notarized signature. Or go in person to your town clerk.
Some call the passage of these laws “election integrity.” All I see is the government making it harder for people to vote – especially women, senior citizens, college students, immigrants, and folks with disabilities.
Over the years, how many women — and even some men — have changed their names through marriage, divorce, or just because they felt like it? How many seniors were born at home or in rural places and never got a formal birth certificate? How many students have mismatched addresses after moving apartments between semesters?
How many seniors, people with disabilities, and rural neighbors who work hard hours vote absentee because it’s a lot simpler for them than waiting in line for an ambiguous amount of time on Election Day?
At least 96 voters already started seeing the consequences of these laws play out when they were turned away from the polls during town meeting season. We can only imagine how many more will be discouraged from participating altogether.
All of us on the reasonable side of the fence believe in election integrity. We believe in sensible audits and consequences for the (literally) 10 bad actors our state has flagged since 2020.
But democracy works best when more people participate, the rules are clear and fair, and leaders work for us — not interest groups funding ads about fraud no one can find.
Many of us already show photo ID at the polls. We already rely on a bipartisan, decentralized system run by people who live down the street. I’m one of those volunteers. If integrity is the goal, there are smarter ways to get there than by tripping up voters in a middle school gym.
So, what do we do?
First, don’t wait. If you need to register, start early. If you moved, changed your name, or you’re a student deciding where “home” is for voting, resolve those questions now. Don’t wait until Election Day. The Secretary of State’s website has official guidance and links to local clerk’s office. Use them. Your clerk can tell you when to come in, what your options are, and how to avoid last-minute surprises.
Second, let’s fix the policy. If we’re serious about access and trust, let’s pass laws that meet voters where they are.

Protect Election Day registration. It’s a tradition that boosts participation. Attempts to roll it back are a solution in search of a problem.
Expand early and absentee voting. Parents, shift workers, caregivers, and rural voters don’t need more red tape in their lives. They need flexibility.
Modernize election security. Paper ballots, risk-limiting audits, and strong cybersecurity make our elections safer — without making them harder.
Fix campaign finance. Voters deserve to know who’s paying for the megaphones.

These are the practical steps that lead to election integrity. And if you’re standing in the way, it’s worth asking whether your goal is about integrity — or control.
Participation and security are not enemies. When more eligible Granite Staters vote, and when we can all see and trust the system that counts those votes, confidence grows. When we throw up new barriers, tell people to compile the amount of documentation they would need for a mortgage closing, and call it “integrity,” trust shrinks.
For now, the voting laws on the books lack common sense. They would keep practical women like my mom from the polls.
But New Hampshire is at its best when we lead with common decency. So maybe, with enough of us pushing, we’ll remember what “Live Free or Die” really demands: a government that trusts its people and a democracy where every Granite Stater can raise their hand and say, “I’m here.”

(Photo by  Aaron Sutch/Solar United Neighbors)Could an innovative energy project bringing light and hope to Puerto Rico also illuminate the Old Dominion?
Back in 2017, a hurricane destroyed Puerto Rico’s power grid. The island struggled to rebuild it, with limited success, and continues to experience a severe electricity shortage and frequent power outages. Customers and nonprofits have stepped into the void, installing solar panels on rooftops all over the island and backing them up with batteries. Today, 175,000 households have solar — about 1 in 7  – and at least 160,000 of those also have battery backup. Thousands of new installations go in every month.
The solar and batteries don’t just secure electricity for the customers who install them. Through programs like one managed by the solar company Sunrun, Puerto Rico’s grid can draw on the batteries to provide power in times of emergency, reducing the frequency and duration of power outages for everyone. 
Last month, as hurricane season got underway again, Puerto Rico’s grid operator announced it had reached a “major energy milestone.” In a statement posted on X, LUMA Energy said it “successfully dispatched approximately 70,000 batteries, contributing around 48 MW of energy to the grid.” That’s about as much as a gas peaker plant, with no need for fuel.
Puerto Rico’s experience shows how residents and businesses no longer need to be passive energy consumers. With a well-designed program they can play an active role in keeping the lights on in their communities, and get paid for it. 
This customer participation creates what is called a “virtual power plant” (VPP), sometimes also called a community power plant. The VPP may use battery aggregation, as in Puerto Rico, or demand reduction measures like temporary adjustments to smart thermostats or shifting electric vehicle charging to off-peak times. The more these measures are combined, the bigger the benefit to the grid, and the less a utility needs to invest in new generation to meet peaks in demand.

VPPs offer such promise that this year Virginia’s General Assembly directed Dominion Energy to develop a pilot program for its customers, to be overseen by the State Corporation Commission. 
HB2346, from Del. Phil Hernandez, D-Norfolk, calls for a program of up to 450 MW to “optimize demand” with distributed energy resources, mainly batteries but also smart thermostats, electric vehicle charging and non-battery storage (e.g., electric hot water heaters). The proposal, due to be filed with the SCC by December 1, must include incentives for at least 15 MW of residential batteries. The legislation calls for stakeholder participation in the development of the VPP, with opportunities for public input. 
Dominion is also tasked with expanding the electric school bus program it began in 2019, which allows the utility to make use of school bus batteries at times of the day when the buses are not needed to transport children. As of March of 2024, Dominion had 135 electric buses in the program, spread across 25 school districts in Virginia. 
The impact of VPPs can be significant. This summer, California’s grid operator conducted an experiment to determine how much customer batteries could contribute to the needs of the grid. More than 100,000 residential batteries across California delivered an average of 535 MW of power from 7 to 9 p.m. on July 29, an output equivalent to that of a coal plant. 
Many other states are also using VPPs. Some are limited to solar-powered battery aggregation, like Xcel’s Colorado program and a new Texas program, while others involve demand response programs using smart appliances – anything that can be turned off and on remotely for short periods. In Michigan, DTE pays electric vehicle owners to charge at off-peak times, while Arizona Public Service’s VPP pays customers for the ability to access their smart thermostats to reduce peak demand.
Vermont’s Green Mountain Power runs two popular battery programs, one for people who own their own batteries and the other that leases batteries to customers. Both allow the utility to draw on the batteries when the power grid requires more capacity. 
While Virginia has not had a VPP program before, appliance-based demand response will be familiar to residents who opted into Dominion Energy’s “Smart Cooling Rewards” program.  Participants allowed the utility to remotely turn their air conditioners on and off for a few minutes at a time on hot days in exchange for an annual $40 payment. This helped the utility shave peak demand without affecting residents’ comfort. 
Dominion ended the cooling rewards program in 2022 and now offers a “Peak Time Rebate” program that rewards customers for reducing energy use during certain times of high energy demand. This program, however, requires residents to take affirmative measures themselves, like adjusting thermostats and delaying laundry. A well-designed VPP program, by contrast, takes the burden off the individual.
Josephus Allmond, a lawyer with the Southern Environmental Law Center who helped to craft the Virginia VPP legislation, told me in an email that he expects school buses and smart thermostats will make up most of Dominion’s program initially, but he’d like to see the residential battery component grow significantly from the initial 15 MW. Even 100,000 aggregated residential batteries would be a minor share of Dominion’s 2.8 million residential accounts, he pointed out.
I emailed Nathan Frost, Dominion’s general manager for new business and customer solutions, to ask for more information about the VPP program. Frost replied only that Dominion is “actively developing our VPP framework and will be engaging stakeholders soon.”    
Stakeholders, including customers themselves, are likely to have a lot to say. Clean energy advocates have long urged that VPPs, distributed generation sources and microgrids can contribute to a more efficient, secure and resilient grid, at less cost to everyone. 
No doubt recentering the grid around customers is too tall an order for a monopoly utility with a profit model based on centralized generation. But from what we’ve seen in Puerto Rico, California and elsewhere, harnessing even some of the power of customer-owned resources is a worthwhile project whose time has finally come.

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)For more than thirty years, Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, has navigated Virginia politics with a simple motto: “Be nice.” The Republican, who was elected minority leader by his caucus in May, keeps a copy of the credo on his desk on the House floor and embodies it as he roams the halls of the Capitol, dishing out grins in the depths of February budget battles.
Politically, Kilgore’s amiability translates into a willingness to cut deals.
To help Southwest Virginia’s economy, he has embraced projects that are controversial within his own party and constituents, including Medicaid expansion, the legalization of casino gambling and a regional hospital monopoly. 
Kilgore declined an interview for this story. But in two interviews last year, he laid out a vision of politics built around compromise.
“If you get 60-70% of what you want, that’s a win,” Kilgore said in July 2024. “A lot of folks don’t see it that way.”
Kilgore’s deals sometimes benefit his donors, his family and himself. He’s sponsored bills that benefit his twin brother Jerry Kilgore’s lobbying clients and helped appoint allies to the local judicial bench. In 2018, his colleagues roasted him with an “Overdog Award,” complete with a trophy overflowing with campaign cash, for driving legislation that allowed Dominion Energy, his largest donor, to keep hundreds of millions in excess profits.

Kilgore’s new role as the top Republican in the House of Delegates means he’ll have to strike his toughest deal yet in this November’s elections: convincing swing voters to trust the GOP against the backdrop of President Donald Trump’s continued unpopularity in the commonwealth. Kilgore is no personal danger in his ruby red district but he needs to help Republican candidates  flip two swing seats to retake the House majority. They’re seen as an underdog, with GOP gubernatorial hopeful Winsome Earle-Sears trailing Democrat Abigail Spanberger by 7% among likely voters in a recent poll from Roanoke College.
Kilgore’s job won’t be any easier in January, when the legislature convenes. The bipartisanship he championed for years has been strained by increasingly bitter battles over abortion, guns and surging energy demand. An increasing number of Democrats and some Republicans have taken a critical view of powerful special interests like Dominion Energy. 
Still, Chris Saxman, a former Republican delegate who served with Kilgore from 2002 to 2010 who now heads the pro-business advocacy group Virginia Free, said Kilgore was a “very skilled operator” who would pick his battles strategically.
“People confuse nice with weakness, and one should never do that with Terry Kilgore,” Saxman said.
 The Dealmaker

Kilgore’s politics are at least partly explained by his background in Scott County, on the Tennessee border.
Shaped by isolation from Richmond — parts of the region are closer to seven other states’ capitals — Southwest Virginia defies easy political categorization. The region elected one of the two first women to serve in the General Assembly in 1923 and sometimes elected Republicans during Democratic Byrd Machine’s dominance in the early 20th century.
Regional lawmakers from both parties learned to band together in farflung Richmond, according to Duane Miller, the longtime head of the LENOWISCO Planning District Commission, which coordinates economic development projects. Southwest Virginia’s small political presence at the statehouse — diminished further by population losses driven by the decline of coal — made bipartisan cooperation essential to winning state attention to the region’s needs, Miller said.
“Whether Richmond is a Democrat majority or a conservative majority, in Southwest Virginia, you have to be able to relate and get along with everybody because we have fewer voices,” Miller said.

Kilgore’s 1993 election to the House of Delegates made him the first Republican to represent the district since at least 1947. He found early ways to make his mark. Working with Jerry Kilgore, who served at the time as Gov. George Allen’s secretary of public safety, the brothers helped bring two high security prisons in the region that are now major employers. 
Even as Jerry lost the 2005 gubernatorial contest to Democrat Tim Kaine, Terry rose through the ranks of the House Republican majority, eventually assuming the chair of the powerful Commerce and Labor Committee and the Virginia Tobacco Commission. The commission helped bring broadband to Appalachian hollers, funded scholarships and helped set up Lincoln Memorial University’s veterinary school, the largest private vet school in the U.S.
Kilgore sidestepped pressure to run for Congress and turned down a federal judgeship. As a delegate, he felt he could do more for Southwest Virginia than he would on the bench or in Congress.
“I sort of got into a niche here,” Kilgore said.
 The Virginia Way

To Kilgore’s critics, that niche became a little too cozy — emblematic of “The Virginia Way.” The phrase has sometimes been invoked proudly, to describe a form of political civility and pro-business legislative consensus in Virginia. But Jeff Thomas, author of “The Virginia Way: Democracy and Power after 2016,” argues that Virginia lawmakers have regularly prioritized donors’ interests over constituents, enabled by the commonwealth’s nearly unfettered campaign finance laws and lax ethics rules.
“I think that [Kilgore] embodies a lot of what’s wrong about Virginia politics,” Thomas said.
Kilgore’s deep ties to major donors, particularly Dominion Energy, have been a consistent theme in his career. As chair of the Virginia Tobacco Commission, Kilgore and commission members sent $30 million in economic development funds from 2012 to 2014 to help build a pipeline fueling a Dominion plant. VTC’s own funding formulas called for giving less than a quarter of that amount. 
Kilgore also backed a $1.8 billion coal-fired power plant in Wise County that Dominion completed in 2012, over the objections of environmentalists who said it was unnecessary. In 2020, with Democrats aiming to quickly retire a plant that operated at 22% of its capacity in 2019, Kilgore struck a deal with the party to delay the plant’s closure — a move he said was necessary to fund local government services. In exchange, he was the only House Republican to vote for the sweeping Virginia Clean Economy Act, a Democratic priority aimed at decarbonizing the electric grid by 2050. 
At some points, Kilgore’s legislative causes have overlapped with his brother Jerry’s lobbying clients. Terry Kilgore sponsored 2024 legislation aimed at legalizing gaming terminals at convenience stores. Jerry Kilgore’s lobbying clients included Pace-O-Matic, a key driver of the bill and, through an affiliated industry group, Del. Kilgore’s second largest donor last year. 
When one of Jerry Kilgore’s clients and Del. Kilgore’s donors, Mountain State Health Alliance, wanted to advance a merger with a rival hospital system, Terry Kilgore sponsored 2015 legislation allowing the change and led public hearings before it was ultimately approved by the state health commissioner in 2017, over the objections of federal regulators. The resulting company, Ballad Health, has drawn criticism for failing to meet many of the benchmarks set by regulators. Nonetheless, state regulatory filings show Jerry Kilgore, who has continued to lobby for Ballad, unsuccessfully pushed for reduced state oversight of the company as recently as 2023. 
The delegate said he and his brother “don’t always agree on everything” and noted Ballad made good on its promises to re-open a shuttered Lee County hospital.
Arguably the biggest nexus for Kilgore’s regional political clout is his law firm, headquartered out of a sturdy former bank in downtown Gate City.

Across the street at the Scott County Court, Kilgore argues cases in front of judges whom he helped appoint. In Virginia, local delegations of lawmakers pick local judges in a largely closed-door process. Kilgore and other practicing lawyer-lawmakers have an unusual relationship with the bench, who hear their cases and require lawmakers’ support to retain their job.
Southwest Virginia’s judgeships are stocked with people Kilgore knows well, including his former officemate, two former associates who worked for his firm and a former colleague in the House Republican caucus. 
Given the many factors that go into court cases, it’s difficult to definitively determine whether those ties have given Kilgore’s clients a leg up. Kilgore said he “gets basically what everyone else gets” when it comes to legal outcomes. 
But the appointment process has presented other opportunities. In 2021, Kilgore and other local lawmakers appointed Scott County’s top prosecutor to the bench. Kilgore’s son, Kyle Kilgore, who’d finished law school two years before, ran for the vacant commonwealth’s attorney seat and won an uncontested race.
In 2023, local lawmakers appointed their colleague, then-delegate Jeff Campbell, to the bench. Kilgore subsequently purchased Campbell’s law firm. The move allowed Kilgore to pick up Campbell’s clients and, together with a merger with a law firm in Blacksburg, expand the reach of his practice to become among the region’s largest.
Kilgore’s legal clients have sometimes had a distinctly political tint.
When China Machinery Engineering Corp. of Beijing sought to build an arena in Virginia Beach in 2013, they hired Terry Kilgore, who lived a seven-hour drive away, as an attorney — news first reported by the defunct news site watchdog.org, which said Kilgore signed a contract with the company worth $1.2 million. 
Kilgore said that the true total was “nowhere close” to that amount. The attorney said that he’d been brought on to the project because his firm “knew some people who knew some people” in Virginia Beach but that his work on the project, which never got off the ground, had been limited.
More recently, Kilgore has provided legal representation to Clyde Stacy, a local coal mining magnate whose 2023 plan to bring a private landfill to Russell County generated a groundswell of local opposition. 
As the plan was being considered by the county’s board of supervisors, Kilgore became the board’s attorney, and in at least one case, attempted to squelch criticism of the project, leading some activists to accuse him of having a conflict of interest. Kilgore said he’d recused himself from all landfill business.

 A purple state battleground

Kilgore’s new position may bring more scrutiny to future deals. But his immediate task is to raise lots of money and help swing-district Republicans win tough suburban races.
It’s not going to be easy. In last year’s presidential elections, Kamala Harris carried 59 of the state’s 100 House districts, according to an analysis from the Virginia Public Access Project. The Roanoke College poll found 56% of Virginia residents disapproved of Trump’s job as president.
In Kilgore’s view, Virginia’s political landscape has changed since Trump’s first term, when Republicans lost control of the House for the first time in over 20 years.
“President Trump’s doing a lot better,” Kilgore told conservative talk show host John Fredericks in July. “Our economy’s just running on all cylinders right now.”
Kilgore has never come across as a MAGA diehard. But how he handles Trump’s policies — the tariffs, the cuts to Medicaid, the immigration raids, the firing of federal workers — may help define his legacy.
For Democrats like Del. Vivian Watts, D-Fairfax, who spent decades working alongside Kilgore, it can be difficult to square the Republican’s personal warmth with Trump’s politics. She said Kilgore’s new position means he’ll be asked to own the president’s policies or risk provoking his caucus and the White House.
“My bet is that the Terry that I’ve seen for so long will not change into the aggressive partisan spokesman,” she said. “The issue is whether or not the Republican House caucus is going to be satisfied with what’s in front of the camera.”
It’s also not clear how long Kilgore will want the job. The Republican is the first to admit he is in the twilight of his political career. 
“I can’t do it too much longer,” he said in a July, 2024 interview.
For now, Kilgore’s Subaru Crosstrek is criss-crossing the state, hitting fundraisers from Chesapeake to Harrisonburg. Saxman, the former delegate, said Kilgore was one of a handful of politicians he knows who seemed to genuinely enjoy politics.
“They have this glint in their eye,” Saxman said. “They just love what they do and they’re really good at it and the people around them really like them, too.”

The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.
U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.

For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.
Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy  countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.
To improve infant and child health, the authors of the op-ed proposed antipoverty measures such as child tax credits; social media restrictions; broader health insurance coverage; more investment in primary care; and more restrictive firearm laws.

(Photo courtesy of LifeWise Academy)In the past month or so, federal courts have dealt a string of blows to conservatives’ push for the biblical Ten Commandments to be posted in public schools.
Yet as states lose over required religious displays, many are working on another route to faith-based education by allowing kids to attend off-campus religious instruction. This year, Iowa, Montana, Ohio and Texas passed laws guaranteeing parents the right to have their children excused during the school day for free, off-campus religious instruction, often called “released time.”
Those four states are the latest of at least 12 that require school districts to offer released time religious schooling upon parental request, including: Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Wisconsin.
The released time approach may be more likely to pass constitutional muster than other government-imposed religious efforts, experts say, by shifting influence off school grounds and under the direction of faith-based groups rather than public school teachers, and by making it free to students.
A 1952 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Zorach v. Clauson allows for released time religious instruction as long as it’s off school property, privately funded and parent permitted.
Eyeing a friendly Supreme Court, Republicans push for the Ten Commandments in schools

“Not every family has access to private or parochial school, but for many generations families have been able to take their students out of school for a portion of the day for religious education if they choose,” said Jennifer Jury, a program advocate for LifeWise Academy, an Ohio-based Christian nonprofit founded in 2018.
The organization has been active in expanding its reach and lobbying lawmakers for stronger legislative support. This school year, LifeWise expects to serve nearly 100,000 public school students across 1,100 schools in 34 states, Jury said.
The off-campus gatherings work the same way in most states: With parents’ approval, public school students sign out of school during a lunch, recess or study hall block. Students will either walk or ride one of the distinctive red LifeWise buses to a local church or a program-leased community building in town.
And depending on state limitations for the religious instruction, for either a half or full hour, kids will learn about the Bible. When the allotted time is up, students go back to their public school to finish the day.
In some states, students can earn academic credit for the off-campus instruction, which has been more controversial.
In Montana, for example, legislation that would have required school districts to develop policies for academic credit was amended to “authorize” a district to allow credit, after pushback from the state’s school boards and school administrators associations.
“School districts should have the autonomy to determine which external coursework aligns with the academic frameworks and whether such courses should be eligible for credit,” Rob Watson, who represented the two groups at the legislature, said in his comments to a House committee in February. He noted the groups did not oppose the released time policy itself.
Despite the changes, only one Democrat in the legislature voted “yes.” Montana GOP Gov. Greg Gianforte signed the bill into law in May.
Supporters had touted the academic credit option as a way to entice homeschooling families to consider public schools. In her interview with Stateline, Jury noted similar programs that accommodate Jewish, Muslim and Mormon faith-based teaching for public school students.
“Whether a person is religious or not, the Bible is widely recognized as one of the most influential books in history,” Jury said. “A lot of our Western culture was born out of ideas that come from the Bible, like the fact that every person is created equal, that we are to love our neighbor.”
Identical bill language
The conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, known as ALEC, in August adopted model legislation about released time policies that state lawmakers can propose.
Public schools would be required to allow dismissal for religious instruction under new bill

ALEC’s proposal would allow from one to five hours per week of off-campus religious instruction and would require school districts to award academic credit if the course meets certain criteria. Districts would have to assess instruction based on secular standards and would not be allowed to test for particular religious content, according to the model legislation.
Nearly identical language had already appeared in several state bills, including in North Carolina and West Virginia this year and in Mississippi in 2023. In North Carolina, LifeWise Academy registered with the secretary of state’s office in 2024, as reported by NC Newsline, and a released time bill was introduced in February. It was sent to committee but never moved ahead.
The bills in Mississippi and West Virginia also stalled.
Legislation that does become law earns praise from groups such as Alliance Defending Freedom, one of the nation’s most active legal organizations opposing abortion rights and same-sex marriage.
Statements from Greg Chafuen, senior counsel for the nonprofit’s Center for Public Policy, say the new released time laws respect “parents’ educational decisions” and ensure “parents are in the driver’s seat when it comes to their kids’ education.”
An Indiana law lets high school students leave school for religious instruction each week for an amount of time equal to one elective course. Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Tennessee laws allow students to earn elective credit for released time religious instruction, though it cannot replace a “core curriculum” class. School boards can set standards for when such programs qualify for credit.
LifeWise operates in each of those states.
Ten Commandment displays
Jury, of LifeWise Academy, said her organization wants off-campus religious options for public school students to be available in all 50 states.
“It’s important to note this is an option, and parents are the ultimate decision-makers in enrollment,” she said.
“We would love to see every student in the United States have the option to attend a program like LifeWise if they want to and if their parents want them to.”
A lack of parental choice might be what trips up state efforts to post the Ten Commandments in classrooms.











This is an option, and parents are the ultimate decision-makers in enrollment.

After Louisiana last year became the first state in recent decades to require that the Ten Commandments, a central tenet of the Judeo-Christian tradition, be displayed in school classrooms, bills followed in at least 15 other states. Two states — Arkansas and Texas — enacted laws.
But for now, courts have blocked the mandates in all three states. In Texas, U.S. District Judge Fred Biery warned the displays “are likely to pressure [children] into religious observance” and undermine parents’ rights.
In Arkansas, U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks called the state’s requirement to post a specific version of the Ten Commandments “plainly unconstitutional.”
The law “is not neutral with respect to religion,” he wrote. “By design, and on its face, the statute mandates the display of expressly religious scripture in every public-school classroom and library.”
He also noted that the law “requires that a specific version of that scripture be used, one that the uncontroverted evidence in this case shows is associated with Protestantism and is exclusionary of other faiths.”

(Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images)The Trump administration’s cuts to CDC funding for state and local health departments had vastly uneven effects depending on the political leanings of a state, according to a KFF Health News analysis.
Democratic-led states and select blue-leaning cities fought back in court and saw money for public health efforts restored — while GOP-led states sustained big losses.
The Department of Health and Human Services in late March canceled nearly 700 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants nationwide — together worth about $11 billion. Awarded during the COVID-19 pandemic, they supported efforts to vaccinate people, reduce health disparities among demographic groups, upgrade antiquated systems for detecting infectious disease outbreaks, and hire community health workers.
Initially, grant cancellations hit blue and red states roughly evenly. Four of the five jurisdictions with the largest number of terminated grants were led by Democrats: California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, and Massachusetts.
But after attorneys general and governors from about two dozen blue states sued in federal court and won an injunction, the balance flipped. Of the five states with the most canceled grants, four are led by Republicans: Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Ohio.
In blue states, nearly 80% of the CDC grant cuts have been restored, compared with fewer than 5% in red states, according to the KFF Health News analysis. Grant amounts reported in an HHS database known as the Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System, or TAGGS, often don’t match what states confirmed. Instead, this analysis focused on the number of grants.

The divide is an example of the polarization that permeates health care issues, in which access to safety-net health programs, abortion rights, and the ability of public health officials to respond to disease threats diverge significantly depending on the political party in power.
In an emailed statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the agency “is committed to protecting the health of every American, regardless of politics or geography. These funds were provided in response to the COVID pandemic, which is long over. We will continue working with states to strengthen public health infrastructure and ensure communities have the tools they need to respond to outbreaks and keep people safe.”
The money in question wasn’t spent solely on COVID-related activities, public health experts say; it was also used to bolster public health infrastructure and help contain many types of viruses and diseases, including the flu, measles and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.
“It really supported infrastructure across the board, particularly in how states respond to public health threats,” said Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
The Trump cutbacks came as the U.S. recorded its largest measles outbreak in over three decades and 266 pediatric deaths during the most recent flu season — the highest reported outside of a pandemic since 2004. Public health departments canceled vaccine clinics, laid off staff, and put contracts on hold, health officials said in interviews.
After its funding cuts were blocked in court, California retained every grant the Trump administration attempted to claw back, while Texas remains the state with the most grants terminated, with at least 30. As the CDC slashed grants in Texas, its measles outbreak spread across the U.S. and Mexico, sickening at least 4,500 people and killing at least 16.
Colorado, which joined the lawsuit, had 11 grant terminations at first, but then 10 were retained. Meanwhile, its neighboring states that didn’t sue — Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma — collectively lost 55 grants, with none retained.
In Jackson, Ohio, a half-dozen community health workers came to work one day in March to find the Trump administration had canceled their grant five months early, leaving the Jackson County Health Department half a million dollars short — and them without jobs.
“I had to lay off three employees in a single day, and I haven’t had to do that before. We don’t have those people doing outreach in Jackson County anymore,” Health Commissioner Kevin Aston said.
At one point, he said, the funding helped 11 Appalachian Ohio counties. Now it supports one.
Marsha Radabaugh, one employee who was reassigned, has scaled back her community health efforts: She’d been helping serve hot meals to homeless people and realized that many clients couldn’t read or write, so she brought forms for services such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to their encampment in a local park and helped fill them out.
“We would find them rehab places. We’d get out hygiene kits, blankets, tents, zero-degree sleeping bags, things like that,” she said. As a counselor, she’d also remind people “that they’re cared for, that they’re worthy of being a human — because, a lot of the time, they’re not treated that way.”
Sasha Johnson, who led the community health worker program, said people like Radabaugh “were basically a walking human 411,” offering aid to those in need.
Radabaugh also partnered with a food bank to deliver meals to homebound residents.
Aston said the abrupt way they lost the funds — which meant the county unexpectedly had to pay unemployment for more people — could have ruined the health district financially. Canceling funding midcycle, he said, “was really scary.”
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and promoter of vaccine misinformation, has called the CDC a “cesspool of corruption.” At HHS, he has taken steps to undermine vaccination in the U.S. and abroad.
Federal CDC funding accounts for more than half of state and local health department budgets, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. States that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election received a higher share of the $15 billion the CDC allocated in fiscal 2023 than those that Democrat Kamala Harris won, according to KFF.
The Trump administration’s nationwide CDC grant terminations reflect this. More than half were in states that Trump won in 2024, totaling at least 370 terminations before the court action, according to KFF Health News’ analysis.
The Columbus, Ohio, health department had received $6.2 million in CDC grants, but roughly half of it — $3 million — disappeared with the Trump cuts. The city laid off 11 people who worked on investigating infectious disease outbreaks in such places as schools and nursing homes, Columbus Health Commissioner Mysheika Roberts said.
She also said the city had planned to buy a new electronic health record system for easier access to patients’ hospital records — which could improve disease detection and provide better treatment for those infected — but that was put on ice.
“We’ve never had a grant midcycle just get pulled from us for no reason,” Roberts said. “This sense of uncertainty is stressful.”
Columbus did not receive its money directly from the CDC. Rather, the state gave the city some funds it received from the federal government. Ohio, led by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and a Republican attorney general, did not sue to block the funding cuts.
Columbus sued the federal government in April to keep its money, along with other Democratic-led municipalities in Republican-governed states: Harris County, Texas, home to Houston; the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County in Tennessee; and Kansas City, Missouri. A federal judge in June blocked those cuts.
As of mid-August, Columbus was awaiting the funds. Roberts said the city won’t rehire staff because the federal funding was expected to end in December.
Joe Grogan, a senior scholar at the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Institute and former director of the White House Domestic Policy Council in Trump’s first term, said state and local agencies “are not entitled” to the federal money, which was awarded “to deal with an emergency” that has ended.
“We were throwing money out the door the last five years,” Grogan said of the federal government. “I don’t understand why there would ever be a controversy in unspent covid money coming back.”
Ken Gordon, Ohio Department of Health spokesperson, wrote in an email that the $250 million in grants lost had helped with, among other things, upgrading the disease reporting system and boosting public health laboratory testing.
Some of the canceled HHS funding wasn’t slated to end for years, including four grants to strengthen public health in Indian Country, a grant to a Minnesota nonprofit focused on reducing substance use disorders, and a few to universities about occupational safety, HIV, tuberculosis, and more.
Brent Ewig, chief policy and government relations officer for the Association of Immunization Managers, said the cuts were “the predictable result of ‘boom, bust, panic, neglect’ funding” for public health.
The association represents 64 state, local, and territorial immunization programs, which Ewig said will be less prepared to respond to disease outbreaks, including measles.
“The system is blinking red,” Ewig said.



 Methodology

KFF Health News’ analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants sought to answer four questions: 1) How many grants have been terminated in the U.S. under the Trump administration since March? 2) Which states saw the most grants cut? 3) What were the grants for? and 4) Did the grant terminations affect blue, red, and purple states differently? This follows a similar analysis by KFF Health News for an article on nationwide NIH grant terminations.
Our primary data source was a Department of Health and Human Services website showing grant terminations. We compared an initial list of grant terminations from April 3 with one from July 11 to determine how many grants had been restored. The USAspending.gov database helped us track grants by state.
To classify states politically, we followed the same steps from our April coverage of National Institutes of Health grant terminations. States were “blue” if Democrats had complete control of the state government or if the majority of voters favored Democratic presidential candidates in the last three elections (2016, 2020, 2024). “Red” states were classified similarly with respect to the Republican Party. “Purple” states had politically split state governments and/or were generally considered to be presidential election battleground states. The result was 25 red states, 17 blue states, and eight purple states. The District of Columbia was classified as blue using similar methods.
This analysis does not account for potential grant reinstatements in local jurisdictions where the funds were awarded indirectly rather than directly from the CDC; it accounts only for the recipients’ location, and excludes grants terminated from Compacts of Free Association states and other foreign entities that received grants directly from the CDC. At least 40 CDC grants were terminated that were meant for global health efforts or assisting public health activities in other nations following the Trump administration’s order for the CDC to withdraw support for the World Health Organization.

Burt Jones at the kickoff for his campaign for governor. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderWhy should GOP primary voters vote for Lt. Gov. Burt Jones to be Georgia’s next governor over Attorney General Chris Carr or another candidate who may emerge between now and May’s party primary?
For several speakers at Jones’ official campaign kick-off in Flovilla last week, Jones’ loyalty to President Donald Trump shows he is the right person for the job. Jones – who celebrated receiving Trump’s endorsement last month – is so loyal to the president that he tried to help Trump win the 2020 election even after he already lost it, said now-U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach.
Five years and multiple investigations and court cases later, nobody has been charged with rigging the 2020 election in Georgia or any other state.
 U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“We saw boxes being stuffed,” Beach said. “We saw all this, and we got all these complaints, and so we started asking questions. And we wanted a special session, we wanted to get down to the bottom of it, and that’s when I learned this man has backbone and courage. And I will tell you, we both got punished. We lost our chairmanships, but we never wavered. He never wavered.”
Jones and Beach, both state senators at the time, were stripped of leadership positions after they joined calls to overturn Trump’s loss in Georgia, punishment from then-Republican, then-Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan.
At the Flovilla rally, Jones and his allies wore that punishment like a badge of honor.
“In 2020, when President Trump needed allies, these politicians were silent,” said Sen. Greg Dolezal, referring to what he characterized as fair weather MAGA fans. “When Fani Willis weaponized her office and tried to take Trump down, these politicians were nowhere to be found. And even when Donald J. Trump was our nominee to beat Joe Biden, these politicians wouldn’t even say his name. This is what I call political appropriation. These politicians want a ticket on the Trump train, but they never paid the price. Let me tell you something, Burt Jones paid the price with blood, sweat and tears.”
Jones also became a potential target of the Fulton County election interference case for his role serving as one of the GOP alternate electors for Trump. But a special prosecutor concluded last year that criminal charges should not be brought against him. That case has stalled since Trump returned to the White House.
To pivot or not to pivot?
But while that pro-Trump rhetoric may play well with GOP primary voters, , a more moderate general electorate could find the Trump fealty more of a turnoff, said Emory University political science professor Andra Gillespie.
 Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“The challenge with the median voter as it relates to primaries and general elections is that what’s necessary to win a primary election could possibly be a liability if you go too far in a general election because the electorate changes and the median voter is going to be more ideologically moderate in a general than in a primary,” she said. “So the question is, do you make promises in a primary election that make you look unprincipled or equivocating in a general election context?”
“If, all of a sudden, he became a Brian Kemp, Chamber of Commerce kind of Republican, it would come off as inauthentic, and risk losing the MAGA base,” she added.
Jones and his allies may be calculating that Jones can avoid the usual political dance to one side during a primary then back to the center during the general.
“So the thing that whoever the Republican nominee has in their favor is there are still more Republicans in the state than Democrats,” Gillespie said. “And so given the fact that the fundamentals of the state privilege Republicans, what he’s banking on is not having to pivot that much. That could be helped or hindered by the strength of the Democratic Party organization going into this election.”
Gillespie said whether the Democratic nominee is former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, state Sen. Jason Esteves or former DeKalb CEO Michael Thurmond, their campaign will likely run ads attacking Jones for his 2020 election interference, should he become the nominee.
“But I think the question is, is that going to be enough to persuade Democratic voters, particularly ones who don’t show up regularly in statewide elections to turn out and vote? I think what Burt Jones or Chris Carr would be banking on is that that’s a tall order, a huge task for Democrats to do, given their numerical disadvantage.”
Be like Kemp
 Gov. Brian Kemp. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Kennesaw State University political science professor and former Cobb County GOP chairman Jason Shepherd said courting voters who still believe in widespread 2020 voter fraud could be a dangerous endeavor.
“Burt Jones needs to thread the needle very carefully,” he said. “I mean, the activist class is still very much focused on 2020, but the activist class within the party as a whole is only 1% of the primary electorate. On top of that, he doesn’t have the entire activist class. So you’re talking about appealing to only about one half of 1%.”
Trump endorsements aren’t quite as hefty as they may be in other states, Shepherd added, referring to the 2022 primary in which most of Trump’s Georgia endorsees fell flat.
That year, Carr fended off the Trump-endorsed John Gordon with nearly three quarters of the vote and Kemp slapped away a challenge from former U.S. Sen. David Perdue, who was enlisted by the former president to dethrone Kemp, with a similar margin.
“Brian Kemp really set the example,” Shepherd said. “Brian Kemp ran a campaign about what he had done in his first four years as governor and didn’t focus on the Trump administration at all. In fact, he more or less ignored Trump’s attacks. Given the opportunity, he would say complimentary things about Donald Trump, just sort of agree to disagree. And I think that shows the path forward.”
In a statement, the Carr campaign indicated they may use a similar approach next year.
“In 2020 and in 2022, Chris Carr proudly stood by Governor Kemp,” said Carr spokesperson Julia Mazzone. “The Governor and Chris Carr received 75% of the vote in the Republican Primary in 2022 because Republicans overwhelmingly endorsed their style of conservative leadership.”

A fading level of safety-net supports for veterans could have consequences when it comes to recruiting new service members, according to a former surgeon general for the U.S. Navy.
While active and former members of the military may have access to care through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), some may not know about it, and some may not be eligible for care in the same way they are eligible for Medicaid. For that reason, 1.7 million veterans rely on Medicaid in the U.S.
Dr. Forrest Faison, who led the medical and health care systems for the U.S. Navy as surgeon general until 2019, said the group of veterans who rely on Medicaid “tends to be these high-need, very vulnerable populations.”
Faison is now provost and senior vice president of academic affairs at Northeast Ohio Medical University.
Coverage through the VA depends on a “disability rating,” according to Faison, which is determined based on your years of service, service-related injuries and other factors. For some that are severely disabled after leaving the service, the VA provides full-service benefits. For others, less coverage is available.
The veteran Medicaid population, which amounts to about 10% of the entire veteran population, uses the program for mental health, housing and other services they may not be able to receive through the VA system.
“There are also veterans that don’t have a very high disability rating, but are nonetheless veterans, who may depend on Medicaid because of job issues, disability, PTSD, things like that,” Faison said.
Ohio will see a $33 billion decrease in federal Medicaid spending over the next ten years, part of the $911 billion in total Medicaid cuts across the country for the next decade, according to estimates from health policy research organization KFF.
 Source: KFF
The reductions come at a time when more members of the military than ever are coming back from conflict, which Faison called “high combat survival.”
“We’re routinely saving men and women who would have died in any previous conflict,” Faison said, meaning the support for these men and women’s health care should be improving, rather than being cut.
  Where will the cuts come from? 
One thing the federal budget bill didn’t do was reduce the federal match Ohio receives from its current 90%, meaning the state’s Medicaid expansion group is still in place. The state operating budget included language that would have eliminated the group if the federal match went down even 1%.
The estimated losses would come the implementation of work requirements in the federal bill, which imposes new requirements on those aged 19 to 64 who are in the Medicaid expansion population, with exemptions for things such as medical conditions or individuals with young children.
“Previous evidence suggests that work requirements may cause many Ohioans to lose their insurance, even if they are employed or have a condition that exempts them from new requirements,” the Health Policy Institute of Ohio said in an analysis of the federal budget bill. “While the exact impact of these requirements will differ depending on upcoming federal guidance and state decisions, existing analyses based on Ohio’s submitted work requirements waiver suggest that up to 200,000 Ohioans could lose coverage.”
Other losses could come from taxes on medical providers, which states like Ohio use to create revenue for their Medicaid programs. These can include Medicaid managed care plans, commercial health insurers, nursing homes and hospitals. The Health Policy Institute of Ohio said restrictions included in the federal bill “will result in significant Medicaid funding shortfalls for Ohio.”
The state’s Medicaid department itself saw a drop in funding from the state operating budget, amounting to $93.7 million in fiscal year 2026 and $650 million in 2027, when compared to the executive budget proposed by Gov. Mike DeWine.
“Unless the state finds new revenue sources, Ohio will need to cut billions of dollars of annual Medicaid spending in the coming years,” the institute’s analysis stated.
The institute said “primary ways” in which the department could lower spending would be in the areas of provider reimbursement rates, covered services or eligibility groups, including Medicaid expansion.
Ohio veterans on Medicaid
It’s hard to tell how many veterans this might impact specifically, because while the application for Medicaid includes a box to note one’s veteran status, checking the box is optional, according to a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Medicaid. The think tank Policy Matters Ohio noted that from 2021 to 2023, 1 in 10 Ohio veterans were enrolled in Medicaid and/or had a family member in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
Policy Matters Ohio researcher Heather Smith said in an August brief that the federal budget bill would not only cut Medicaid funding for veterans, but also implement workforce reductions at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs locations.
“Medicaid is crucial to filling health coverage gaps for many veterans, especially those who have low income or are unable to prove service-connected disabilities,” Smith wrote, adding that nearly half of veterans covered by Medicaid have reported a disability.

This redetermination process would occur twice a year instead of once per year, leading to an increase in administrative load along with extra work for those eligible for coverage. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, previous experience has shown that “people who still meet eligibility criteria will lose coverage and ‘churn’ on and off Medicaid, leading to interruptions in people’s medications and treatments.”
  ‘We have no plan’ 
The struggles that veterans may face in getting proper medical care and other services after they’ve come home from service reflects back to a country of young people who are debating service themselves, and the parents who want to make sure they remain as safe as possible.
“What we found and continue to find … is our recruiting and our ability to retain the force necessary to defend and protect us … depends on how well it’s perceived by others that we take care of our active duty and then from that, our veterans,” Faison said.
In his days as surgeon general of the Navy, Faison frequently asked leaders about a national strategy to help veterans, wounded or not, and how the country would support the future of the military through its care for those in uniform. He asked as military members came back from Iraq and Afghanistan, and as cuts to parts of the military care system kept coming in order to pay for other needs within the government.
“I asked these questions all four years I was surgeon general, and no one could answer those questions,” Faison said. “Which told me we have no plan.”
The Ohio Department of Veterans Services endeavors to get those who are eligible for VA services transitioned from Medicaid to VA care. The program “supports veterans with service-connected disabilities who are in long-term care,” according to the state Department of Veterans Services.
Since 2013, the Veterans On Medicaid program has “helped more than 75 veterans secure VA benefits and transition from Medicaid, allowing them to retain their VA pension or compensation while receiving comprehensive VA health care,” according to a spokesperson for the department.
The voluntary Veterans On Medicaid program is free for veterans, with outreach staff who help find placement at VA locations or other proper facilities.
Ohio has five VA medical facilities, located in Cleveland, Columbus, Chillicothe, Cincinnati and Dayton. The locations can mean struggles for veterans who are rural residents, which isn’t a small amount, according to Faison.
“A lot of these veterans, especially in Ohio, live in rural areas, where even if you’ve got some benefits, you may not have the services available,” he said.
Medicaid “was seen as a safety net” for those Faison knew who couldn’t readily access or didn’t know about their eligibility for VA coverage.
So as the federal government looks to make cuts to that safety net, the consequences have to be considered, he said. Those consequences aren’t only in quality medical care, but also in housing, food security and employment for veterans after their service. Consequences that could mean less interest in serving for fear of a lack of support afterward.
“Every mom and dad in America is looking at how well we take care of these folks to help influence whether their son or daughter puts on the uniform and serves our nation to protect us,” Faison said. “So there’s a lot riding on that.”

Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act on access to care for millions of Americans. 
Nearly two months after the law’s passage, hospital executives here say there are critical details still unknown that make it difficult to determine exactly how it will impact providers and patients.
“My best guess is it’s not going to be good for hospital providers and health care in general,” Vincent Capece, president and CEO of Middlesex Hospital, an independent hospital located in Middletown, CT. “There’s going to be less money available, but exactly how much and how that all works out when the dust settles is really hard to calculate.”
The law makes several changes to Medicaid, known as HUSKY in Connecticut, that are projected to kick anywhere from 100,000 to 170,000 residents off the program in the next decade. It also impose new limits on the amount of Medicaid funding states can collect from the federal government through what’s known as the “hospital provider tax.” 
Those are just some of the policies that could spell trouble for a hospital’s bottom line.  
Health care researchers predict the law’s major components, some of which aren’t slated for implementation until 2027 at the earliest, will pose the greatest challenge to rural hospitals and those that serve a large share of Medicaid patients. Hospitals that aren’t performing well financially might also be less poised to absorb potential revenue hits that the law’s measures could bring. 
The Connecticut Mirror spoke with hospital executives from around the state about how they’re approaching major pending federal changes. 
It’s too early to consider service cuts, in most cases
Most of the hospital leaders who spoke for this article said it’s still too early to consider scaling back services in response to the federal cuts. 
Ben Wade, chief strategy officer at Stamford Health, said he’s hopeful they’ll be able to manage costs without reducing access to services. 
“We have not identified any programs at this time for closure,” Wade said. “We don’t plan to do that.”
However, leaders at small community and rural hospitals acknowledged that they may have to scale back the availability of certain services.

“It’s not necessarily cutting programs,” Kurt Barwis, CEO of Bristol Hospital, said. “It’s starting to look critically and strategically at ‘How do I retool these programs to accomplish the same thing but at a lower cost?’”
Barwis said he’s established partnerships with larger hospital systems, like UConn Health and Hartford HealthCare, and expects to do more of these in the future.
Kyle Kramer, CEO of Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam, said service changes are “inevitable” at rural community hospitals like his, where they must always think about whether there is enough demand for a particular service, he said. 
“There has to be a high enough level of volume to maintain that proficiency,” Kramer said. “And if it becomes a service that is too expensive to offer, we’ve got to think about, ‘Okay, is this something that we should partner with somebody else who has larger scale to provide it?’”
People with commercial insurance may feel impacts to cost, access
While the federal changes directly impact people who get coverage through Medicaid and state-based exchanges, the ripple effects will be felt by everyone, health care leaders warned.
“The impact goes far beyond those who lose coverage. Our entire health system and every community we serve will feel the effects. Reduced services, longer wait times, staff reductions, and the potential closure of programs and facilities,” Daniel Keenan, vice president of government relations at Trinity Health of New England, stated in emailed comments.
Keenan pointed to emergency rooms as an example. When people don’t have coverage, they turn to emergency departments for basic care, resulting in crowding, service delays and staffing issues that impact the entire system, he said.
The changes could drive up costs for people with private insurance, as well. 
Leaders at both Stamford and Middlesex hospitals say the reductions in government Medicaid payments will likely force them to negotiate increased payments from commercial insurers, which could result in higher premiums for those with private coverage.
“We will need to think about the upcoming commercial insurance negotiations that we have to make sure that we have the resources that we need to cover our expenses,” Wade said, adding that if insurers and employers don’t opt to absorb these costs, they will end up hitting people’s premiums. 
Provider tax changes could deal the biggest financial blow
One of the big areas of uncertainty lies with the hospital provider tax, several hospital executives said. The provider tax is an arrangement that allows states to increase the amount of federal Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government by collecting taxes from hospitals and then redistributing those funds back to the facilities. The exchange counts as Medicaid spending by states and entitles them to extra reimbursements from Washington. 
The federal budget bill decreases the “safe harbor limit” — or the rate at which states can tax hospitals — from 6% to 3.5% by 2031, with a phased-in reduction beginning in 2028.
Even though the new limit won’t take effect for several years, federal waivers for the tax rate will pose an issue as soon as next year, when the current provider tax agreement between the state and hospitals expires. In advance of a new agreement, approved by the legislature this year and slated to take effect in July 2026, Connecticut will have to reapply for a federal waiver to tax the hospitals above the safe harbor limit in order to go ahead with its plan to increase hospital taxes by $375 million. 
In the past, states have been permitted to apply for waivers to tax hospitals at rates exceeding the safe harbor limit. Connecticut, for example, taxes hospitals at the maximum 6% for inpatient revenues, but received a federal waiver to tax outpatient revenues at slightly over 10%, said Paul Kidwell, senior vice president at the Connecticut Hospital Association. It’s unclear whether the federal government will continue to grant such waivers, he added.
“It’s a big question mark,” Kidwell said. “We’re proceeding as if we can continue, with the knowledge that we need more information from CMS in order to be certain.” 
Capece, CEO at Middlesex Hospital, said the tax change could be the biggest financial disruptor for his hospital, even more so than changes to Medicaid eligibility. 
“The risk really lies with regard to the provider tax issue,” Capece said. “It’s a huge amount of money.”
Barwis, of Bristol Hospital, called the expiration of the agreement at the end of this fiscal year a looming “day of reckoning” for Connecticut.
“Will [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] grant a new waiver to keep it at 10.5%? Or will CMS say, ‘No, no, no, we’re not going to grant this waiver again. You need to go down to 6%.’ And how will that affect hospitals in the state of Connecticut?” Barwis said. 
Some think there’s still hope for change
At least some Connecticut hospital leaders hope the most potentially damaging effects of the bill could get scaled back or repealed before they go into effect. 
Wade, who oversees strategy at Stamford Health, said there’s a chance that, if Democrats take control of Congress in the midterm elections, some of the changes could be “pushed off or unwound entirely,” he said. 
“We’re still doing a lot of advocacy at the federal level because this is still a moving target,” Wade said.
Kramer, who heads up Day Kimball, agreed that there’s still time for things to change. Capece from Middlesex said he, too, is “cautiously optimistic.” 
CHA’s Kidwell is less convinced the law could be scaled back but, he said, he’s grateful to be facing these federal changes in a state that wants to help as many people as possible keep their health coverage.
“We all have this goal of making sure as many people stay insured as possible and that compliance with federal rules is not so onerous that people fall off because of paperwork,” Kidwell said. “I don’t think that’s the same in other states where they might have a different motivation.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Stamford-Hospital-exterior02-e1625253338482.jpg,,,2025-09-02 05:56:59.130617

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)CANTON, Ohio – About 200 Canton residents gathered at a Plumbers and Pipefitters union hall Tuesday to hear from Democratic U.S. Rep. Emilia Sykes. The Akron native represents Ohio’s 13th congressional district, covering all of Summit County and the Northwest portion of Stark County including Canton.
But Sykes told the crowd that might change. Later this year Ohio state lawmakers have to redraw the state’s congressional map because the previous version passed along party lines. As the Trump administration pushes states like Texas and Indiana to come up with more Republican-friendly districts, Sykes knows she has a target on her back.
“I have always been the apple of the eye of the Republicans in this congressional seat,” she said in an interview, noting the past two elections in the 13th district have cost almost $50 million.
“There’s no reason for me to think that all of a sudden, in 2026 they’ve decided they don’t care about Ohio 13,” Sykes said.
Because she and Democratic U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Toledo represent toss-up seats, they’re likely to be the first places Republican mapmakers look to improve their party’s chances.

Sykes worries about what that could mean for communities like Canton and Akron. Under the previous map, both cities were split and a total of five different lawmakers represented parts of the current district.
“None of them lived in this area,” Sykes said. “This district was the outskirts of all of their districts, so we got what was left over in terms of their time, their attention, the resources they were willing to send here, and it showed.”
Getting to know you
Sykes told attendees about anti-corruption legislation she’s working on and the committees on which she serves. The bill redefines an “official act” to make it harder for government officials to accept gifts; her seat on the Science, Space and Technology Committee helped Akron land a tech hub and gives her an oversight role with the massive Intel project in Licking County.
VP Vance visits Ohio to tout the Trump/Republican One Big Beautiful Bill Act

Sykes also pushed back on Vice President JD Vance characterizing Akron and Canton as “lawless” during a recent visit nearby. She criticized the Trump administration for pausing community policing and nonprofit security grants and “holding them hostage in D.C.”
She also brought up the flood of money that has poured into her last two races to set up a presentation from End Citizens United President Tiffany Muller. That U.S. Supreme Court decision opened the tap, Muller argued, by equating money with speech and corporations with people.
When Sykes opened the floor for questions, two attendees interrupted the event to criticize her for accepting roughly $180,000 from pro-Israel organizations. They were quickly ushered out of the building, and joined several other demonstrators lining the street outside protesting Israel’s war in Gaza.
Other constituents asked about all sorts of issues — passenger rail, solar, school funding, deploying the national guard in American cities. While it was clear Sykes sympathized with their concerns, and committed to fight for them, she had to acknowledge that as a minority member her capacity to make progress is limited.

In limbo
Bill Wyss brought up Medicaid. What happens for seniors who are expecting the program to help cover their long-term care?
Medicare, the health program for elderly and disabled Americans, generally doesn’t cover long-term care, but Medicaid, which serves the poor, does. That means many older Americans must spend down their assets before becoming eligible. The Republican-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act puts that eligibility into doubt.
Sykes told Wyss the details will get hammered out as the bill is implemented, but the cost is shared with the state. With state lawmakers focused policies that reduce state revenue, like the new flat state income tax, there will be less money to go around.
“So, it is going to be bad,” she said. “I don’t know exactly what it’s going to look like, who’s going to be impacted how, or exactly when, but it is not going to be good.”
“I am especially concerned about the folks who have to spend down,” she added. “Who then won’t have anything, any assets to rely upon, because they spent them down thinking they would have Medicaid to support them.”
Speaking outside, Wyss explained the question was personal. His mother has advanced dementia, and after living with Wyss’ family for two years, her condition deteriorated enough that she needed full-time care. Wyss explained she’s in a memory care unit and has gone through about $275,000 in savings.
“She’s just about to the point now where she’s out of funds, and it’s time to apply for Medicaid,” he said. “That’s always been there, but maybe not.”
“And that’s, yes, our personal situation,” Wyss said, “but that’s America’s situation. We’re gonna be talking about, you know, hundreds of thousands of people maybe who have been in nursing home care of some kind and may be thrown out.”
Jodi Roberts asked Sykes about immigration policy. Roberts hosted a family as part of a Biden-era humanitarian parole program called Uniting for Ukraine.
“They are doing the things that we would expect them to do, to hold down jobs, to pay taxes, and now their statuses are at risk,” she said. “Is there any hope? Is there any movement in Congress on behalf of these families?
Sykes pointed to a brief window of optimism last year when a bipartisan group of Senators began hashing out a compromise pairing immigration reforms to funding for Israel and Ukraine.
“One call from candidate Trump to kill the bill, kill the bill and that’s what happened,” Sykes said.
“This is a problem that has been created by the lack of action by Congress,” Sykes acknowledged. “There is not a clear, predictable pathway to coming into this country, and so people choose to come in through illegal means and just hope that they can stay.”
Roberts said within seven months the family she sponsored was on their feet and able to get a place of their own.
“They would like to make a life here,” Roberts said, “They would like to put down roots.”
The problem is the parole program only gives them two years in the U.S. Roberts said they’ve filed for a renewal, but they can’t get an answer.
“It’s like crickets,” she said.

Many American businesses are bracing for higher costs after President Donald Trump levied wide-ranging tariffs this spring, a move that economists have largely panned. But for workers in southeastern Michigan, the heart of the U.S. automotive industry, the story is a little more complicated. Here, manufacturing is “our lifeblood,” according to Sean Crawford, a skilled trades apprentice at General Motors’ Warren Tech Center in suburban Detroit.
A Trump critic, Crawford is mostly skeptical that tariffs will lead to more or better jobs. But Crawford’s co-workers have generally welcomed tariffs on foreign auto manufacturers, he said. As a third-generation autoworker, he understands the appeal. “They’re just happy something is being done,” he said.
Crawford grew up in Flint, Michigan, where he witnessed the loss of thousands of GM jobs decimate the town’s economy. For generations, manufacturing jobs helped people in the region build stable lives — purchase homes, raise families and end their careers with secure retirement.
Trump tapped into that manufacturing mythos when he vowed to make the country “a manufacturing nation once again” in his inauguration speech. He had repeated this message often on the campaign trail, promising to “create millions and millions of jobs, massively raise wages for American workers and make the United States into a manufacturing powerhouse like it used to be many years ago.”
Yet rather than the promised manufacturing revival, the first eight months of Trump’s second term have brought uncertainty and upheaval. Widespread tariffs stalled hiring and rollbacks of clean energy policies have stymied investment and disrupted the fragile momentum that had been building under President Joe Biden, whose legislative agenda had spurred investment in manufacturing.
The fledgling growth of domestic manufacturing that had created more than 610,000 manufacturing jobs during the Biden administration and laid the groundwork for many more has “basically collapsed,” said Todd Tucker, director of industrial policy and trade at the Roosevelt Institute, a Washington-based, left-leaning think tank.
In fact, Trump was so dissatisfied with the weak July jobs report — which showed that the U.S. manufacturing sector had lost 37,000 jobs over three straight months — that he fired the director of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in early August, alleging on his social media platform Truth Social that the less-than-stellar job numbers were “RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.”
Since the president first announced his sweeping tariffs, the country’s trade policy has been marked by chaos and volatility. The tariffs have been wielded for sharply different purposes, with some intended to protect domestic markets and others aimed at punishing foreign countries for actions Trump doesn’t like. That shifting rationale has deepened the sense of uncertainty, as have the constantly changing tariff rates. In addition, countries around the world have responded to the new trade regime with their own retaliatory tariffs.
“It’s almost impossible to keep up with the new deals, the new tariffs, the tariff cuts and the tariff hikes,” said Tucker. The instability is “the opposite of what companies need to be able to make long-term investments.”
That uncertainty has had a chilling effect on manufacturing. Many companies are pulling back from hiring simply because, amid the impulsive and erratic policymaking of the Trump administration, they don’t know what will happen next.
According to a second-quarter survey from the National Association of Manufacturers, just 55.4% of manufacturers are optimistic about the future of their companies — a 15-percentage-point drop since the first quarter and the lowest rating since the early days of the pandemic. Indeed, 89% of manufacturers surveyed said that operational costs have increased due to tariffs. While economists have criticized the broad reach of Trump’s tariffs, Tucker said that “select, strategic and targeted tariffs” could help some American industries.
Crawford’s union, the United Auto Workers, hopes that the 25% tariff on most foreign automakers will lead to a resurgence in domestic manufacturing and more stable jobs for autoworkers. (Japan, whose automakers hold a significant share of the U.S. market, recently negotiated its tariff rate down to 15% in a deal with the Trump administration.)
“[W]e do not support reckless chaotic tariffs on all countries,” UAW President Shawn Fain wrote in an April op-ed for Jacobin. But auto tariffs, he wrote, are “a first step in ending the free-trade disaster,” adding that “the automakers, the auto market, and corporate America can afford it.”
Crawford is not so sure tariffs are a winning strategy, even tariffs on foreign car makers.  “With the tariffs swinging as wildly as they are … I feel like a lot of [car] companies aren’t on firm footing,” he said. He said it’s possible that his job and workplace could benefit, adding that even one additional shift at a plant could create jobs that would be a boon to the local economy. But he doubts that tariffs will inspire companies to break ground on new facilities. Instead, he reasons that if companies pass off tariff costs onto consumers, demand will decline, and layoffs could follow.
Crawford’s concerns about layoffs have already been borne out. GM’s profit fell by more than $1 billion in the second quarter of the year compared to the same period in 2024, a decline executives attributed in part to tariffs. The company temporarily laid off 200 workers at a factory in Detroit suburb Hamtramck in April (though GM representatives blamed “market dynamics,” not tariffs.) That same month, Stellantis laid off 900 workers following dismal quarterly earnings, and Volvo cut more than 1,000 workers at its Mack Truck plants in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia.
At the same time, tariff pressures led GM to announce in April that the company would increase production at a plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and hire 225-250 temporary workers. But temporary workers earn lower pay than other hourly workers and also receive fewer benefits. Temporary status may not even be temporary; Crawford said he’s known temporary workers that have held “temporary” positions for as many as seven years. And that’s not including the workers hired by third-party agencies to do auto production work for companies like GM.
“Yeah, American manufacturing, rah rah rah,” Crawford said sarcastically. “But are those actually going to be good jobs? Are they going to be unionized jobs? Are they going to be family and community supporting jobs?”
If not, he thinks the rhetoric is just “emotionally exploiting” workers who want the secure and stable work manufacturing once promised.
While it remains to be seen how exactly auto manufacturing will be impacted by tariffs, clean energy manufacturing — which was growing rapidly under the Biden administration — has been hard hit by Trump’s industrial policy. Since the start of 2025, more than $18 billion in clean energy manufacturing projects have been cancelled, according to data from environmental business coalition E2. Those cancellations translate into thousands of jobs that will never materialize.
“We were on the cusp of an economic revolution the likes we haven’t seen in generations,” said Bob Keefe, executive director of E2. “Unfortunately, that is now at risk,” he said.
As just one example, more than 1,000 jobs were intended for union sheet metalworkers at a Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. site near Dayton, Ohio, that was set to transition from fossil fuels to hydrogen. Instead, the facility will continue to produce “beautiful coal,” with a goal to “operate fully under AI,” CEO Lourenco Goncalves said in a July earnings call. According to Steel Industry News, the AI operation is meant to increase efficiency for the company by 15%-20%.
“Automation is the name of the game” in many facilities, Babak Hafezi, adjunct professor at American University’s Kogod School of Business and CEO of international consulting firm Hafezi Capital, said in an email. He predicts companies will choose between two strategies if Trump’s trade policy stands: Use exclusively domestic materials alongside automation — in which cases workers are unlikely to benefit — or move production to the cheapest country possible. Either way, workers — and communities that rely on manufacturing — will lose, according to Hafezi.
Crawford believes a stronger labor movement is ultimately what will lead to a resurgence of American manufacturing jobs. It’s hard for workers to bargain for jobs when unions “don’t really have the same dominance in the auto sector like we used to,” he said. He is unsurprised that some manufacturing workers have welcomed tariffs, even if they may mean higher prices and fewer opportunities for other workers.
“People want jobs,” Crawford said. “That’s understandable.”

The Trump administration has ordered construction stopped on Rhode Island’s first large-scale offshore wind project, even though it is 80% complete.

That’s the dire picture of Rhode Island’s future without more offshore wind energy, Christopher Kearns, Rhode Island’s acting energy commissioner, said in an Aug. 8 affidavit submitted to federal court in Massachusetts.
Two weeks later, the Trump administration abruptly halted construction on Revolution Wind, a project already 80% completed and set to begin delivering power to Rhode Island and Connecticut in mid-2026. Predictions of economic and environmental harms quickly solidified, leaving workers stranded at sea, regional grid reliability under threat and state decarbonization mandates potentially out of reach.
“The invocation of the Wind Memorandum to issue a Stop Work Order for the fully permitted Revolution Wind project as it nears completion will harm Rhode Island, its residents, our strong labor workforce, and our offshore wind and related industries,” Kearns wrote in a second affidavit on Aug 28. “Moreover, it will harm our efforts to diversify our energy system and increase reliability.”
The consequences for Rhode Island’s only commercial offshore wind project will feature heavily in a Sept. 4 federal court hearing, where a group of 18 Democratic state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, will ask U.S. District Judge William Young of Massachusetts to throw out the Trump administration’s Jan. 20 executive order halting reviews of offshore wind projects.
“The Revolution stop-work order provides another example of the harmful effects of Defendants’ arbitrary decision to adopt and implement the Wind Directive to stop wind-energy development in our States,” the AGs wrote in an Aug. 28 court filing. “And it underscores the importance of prompt vacatur of that decision to enable projects in and beyond the permitting pipeline to proceed toward development.”

– Attorneys generals in an Aug. 28 filing as part of a multistate lawsuit against the Trump administration


The court hearing in Boston was scheduled two months before the Revolution Wind project was suddenly put in jeopardy, prompted by a multistate lawsuit filed in May against the Trump administration. The initial complaint centered on offshore wind projects still awaiting federal approvals, like the SouthCoast Wind project proposed off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, from which Rhode Island is also in negotiations to buy power.
Revolution Wind did not appear at risk, having already begun construction soon after receiving its final federal permit in November 2023.
Stuck in limbo
Little comfort now to the dozen millwrights idled aboard Wind Scylla in Rhode Island Sound for over a week, who were building turbines when the stop work order came through.
“We’re still waiting for an answer from the companies and the contractors on what’s going on,” Evan Wytas, business representative for Millwrights Local 1121, said in an interview Friday morning. “We haven’t gotten any word that they are on their way back, or when that will be.”
Meanwhile, another two dozen union trade workers scheduled to head out to the construction site Aug. 28 are still on land, waiting by the phone for the call that they can head to work, said Erica Hammond, legislative director for the Rhode Island AFL-CIO.
Workers are still getting paid for now, Hammond confirmed, though those who remain onshore much longer might have to file for unemployment, depending on the specific details of their contracts.
“It is very frustrating,” Hammond said. “To stop now, in the case of this specific project, it’s a waste of resources.”

More than 1,000 union workers have spent the last two years building the 65-turbine project, 40 of which have been installed, as well as a pair of substations that will connect the power supply to Rhode Island and Connecticut. The 704 megawatts of nameplate capacity is enough to power 350,000 homes across both states, equal to 2.5% of the electricity load throughout New England, Kearns said in his affidavit.
The renewable electricity supply has already been baked into Rhode Island’s clean energy portfolio and is crucial to meeting the 2021 Act on Climate Law, which mandates net-zero emissions by 2050 with incremental, legally enforceable benchmarks that kick in at the end of the decade.
Orsted, the Danish company co-developing the project, pledged to explore solutions to resume work, including potential litigation, while exploring the financial implications for its $4 billion project. The company is seeking to raise another $9.4 billion from its shareholders, confirming Friday that its majority stakeholder, the Danish government, has agreed to the share sale. The fundraising plan was unveiled in the company’s Aug. 11 quarterly earnings release, before work was forced to stop on Revolution Wind.
“The stop-work order for Revolution Wind emphasizes the increased regulatory uncertainty for offshore wind in the U.S.,” the company said Friday. “The planned rights issue has been sized to provide the required strengthening of Orsted’s capital structure to execute its business plan, even when taking into account the impact of this uncertainty on Orsted’s US offshore wind portfolio.”
The Revolution Wind project was expected to bring in $156.7 million in net income for the company each year once operational, the company said. An “extraordinary general meeting” is scheduled for Sept. 5 to receive board approval for the share sale.
Neronha’s office is also considering additional legal action, but had not filed anything as of Friday. He’s focused on the existing multistate lawsuit challenging federal actions on offshore wind.
“Revolution Wind, a renewable energy project that is right at the finish line, and which would add 400MW to our clean energy portfolio, must move forward,” Neronha said in a statement Friday. “Billions in investment, more than 1,000 jobs, and an energy future that helps, not hurts, generations to come, are all on the line. For this reason, we formally notified the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts of the President’s unlawful stop work order and the harm it will cause to Rhode Islanders. We cannot allow this Administration to stop this project, and we will continue to explore additional legal avenues to prevent them from doing so.”
DOT yanks port funding
The U.S. Department of Transportation announced Friday it was pulling $679 million in federal infrastructure grants tied to 12 “doomed” offshore wind projects across the country. Among the casualties: an $11.2 million grant for Quonset Development Corp. to upgrade its port, improving terminal access for offshore wind projects along with strengthening resiliency against sea level rise.
“The Quonset Development Corporation is disappointed by this decision but understands that this administration is working to fund projects in line with its current policy priorities,” Steven King, managing director for the quasi-public state agency, said in an emailed response Friday. “Given that the Quonset Business Park’s 250 companies work broadly across nearly every sector of the economy, including in shipbuilding, we believe there is common ground to pursue and look forward to working together on new grant projects that align with the administration’s objectives and that grow the economy.”
Gov. Dan McKee was not as forgiving.
“This decision undermines progress on critical infrastructure and threatens Rhode Island’s economic and energy future,” McKee said in a statement late Friday afternoon. “The Port of Davisville and the broader Quonset Business Park are vital hubs for manufacturing, shipping, and energy, including the state’s offshore wind industry. This funding would have modernized port infrastructure and expanded cargo capacity. By withdrawing it, the Trump administration is undermining a high-performing port that drives real economic output, strengthens regional supply chains, and plays a central role in advancing energy and long-term growth for Rhode Island and across the Northeast.”
The Sept. 4 hearing in Boston will also give the federal agencies and cabinet directors named as defendants a chance to present their own arguments on why the lawsuit should be tossed. Adam Gustafson, acting assistant U.S. Attorney General, defended the federal administration’s pause on offshore wind projects in an Aug. 8 memo, citing “potential legal deficiencies in past practices, the possibility of serious harm to various interests and marine mammals, and the potential inadequacies of various environmental reviews.”
Gustafson argued that states lacked the jurisdiction to challenge federal review powers, at least on a universal basis. He asked the judge to rule in favor of the defendants, or to limit orders to specific projects and permits, rather than a blanket ruling denying federal review power over offshore wind as a whole.
“Limiting relief in such a way would be practical and minimize risk of confusion for Agency Defendants responsible for overseeing federal wind leasing and permitting processes,” Gustafson wrote.
Judge Young is unlikely to make a decision on the dueling motions at the Sept. 4 hearing. A ruling will come at a later, unscheduled date.

I enjoy words. But like most of our state and country today, words have become politicized. Look no further than retired assistant U.S. attorney Leon Patton, who testified in front of the Lenexa City Council last month about using the word “alien” to refer to undocumented immigrants.

“If you think that it’s somehow racist to use the word ‘alien,’ then I presume you got your education by sitting in movie theaters and watching movies about extraterrestrials,” Patton said. “Meanwhile, some of us get our education by sitting in courtrooms and by reading federal statutes.”
Although he later told Kansas Reflector editor Sherman Smith that “I sort of get it,” when talking about the term’s implications, I personally find such a strong reaction to word choice baffling. Language changes and evolves, and has since the beginning of time. The words we once used freely may go into the “forbidden” box. That doesn’t mean anyone has done anything good or bad, necessarily; it just means that tastes have changed.
Progressives worry about such overreactions these days. Perhaps it’s because of President Trump’s linguistic overflow, a constant stream of crude invective. Should they be talking like him? Perhaps it’s because of genuine concern about reaching a broader audience.
Nonetheless, moderate Democratic think tank Third Way just released a list of words that its says politicians should avoid using when talking to the general public.
You can read them all in the accompanying box below.
“We are putting a spotlight on the language we use that puts a wall between us and everyday people of all races, religions, and ethnicities,” the group writes. “These are words that people simply do not say, yet they hear them from Democrats.”
The list doesn’t appear to draw from any polling or research. As a longtime journalist, I’m reminded of “banned words” compilations that grizzled copy editors would pass around in decades past, harping on supposedly ungrammatical or illogical terms.
I don’t love many of the words, and Third Way may have a point. So did the grizzled copy editors! That being said, I’m not sure that studiously avoiding such terms will hand the magical keys to power to progressives. After all, Trump has conspicuously said whatever the heck he wanted. Do political consultants think that lawmakers policing their vocabulary more will improve the situation?
No, the real problem with these politically correct terms is that regular folks just don’t know what they mean. That leaves them open to misinterpretation and outright distortion by political opponents. (Remember “critical race theory”?)
If language has any point besides sounding pretty, it needs to communicate efficiently and clearly. That’s one of the reasons why journalists traditionally avoid language like “passed away” or “went on to his heavenly reward” in favor of the blunt: “he died.”
So yes, do that. But will using a random word from Third Way’s list – or trying to make people think about what they’re saying in the first place – doom democracy?
If so, we have far bigger problems than vocabulary.
Speaking of problems, Kansas legislators just banned some of the simplest words – pronouns – from state employees’ email signatures. That’s right, “he/him,” “she/her,” “they/them” and the like. The last time I checked, such language serves as basic building blocks of English sentences. Perhaps if lawmakers wrote more often, they would understand that.
But conservatives have decided that using such words in a signature block signifies an unacceptable embrace of “gender ideology.” Talk about ridiculous terms.
Including pronouns in an email signature block demonstrates sensitivity and support for transgender people. For today’s senselessly cruel rightwing ideologues, that counts as an unpardonable sin.
So the Kansas Legislature just banned the practice altogether.
The difference, then, between the left and right when it comes to disputed language? Liberals are trying to police themselves to appeal to a greater number of people. Conservatives are literally obliterating disfavored groups’ identities.
I’m not sure that using preferred language always makes a difference. But I know that listening does. And I know that allowing people to use the language they choose, to speak about what they want, can change the world.
What’s in a word? These days, a hell of a lot.

Small local organizations called Active Clubs have spread widely across the U.S. and internationally, using fitness as a cover for a much more alarming mission. These groups are a new and harder-to-detect form of white supremacist organizing that merges extremist ideology with fitness and combat sports culture.
Active Clubs frame themselves as innocuous workout groups on digital platforms and decentralized networks to recruit, radicalize and prepare members for racist violence. The clubs commonly use encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram, Wire and Matrix to coordinate internally.
For broader propaganda and outreach they rely on alternative social media platforms such as Gab, Odysee, VK and sometimes BitChute. They also selectively use mainstream sites such as Instagram, Facebook, X and TikTok, until those sites ban the clubs.
Active Club members have been implicated in orchestrating and distributing neo-Nazi recruitment videos and manifestos. In late 2023, for instance, two Ontario men, Kristoffer Nippak and Matthew Althorpe, were arrested and charged with distributing materials for the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division and the transnational terrorist group Terrorgram.
Following their arrests, Active Club Canada’s public network went dark, Telegram pages were deleted or rebranded, and the club went virtually silent. Nippak was granted bail under strict conditions, while Althorpe remains in custody.
As a sociologist studying extremism and white supremacy since 1993, I have watched the movement shift from formal organizations to small, decentralized cells – a change embodied most clearly by Active Clubs.
 White nationalism 3.0

According to private analysts who track far-right extremist activities, the Active Club network has a core membership of 400 to 1,200 white men globally, plus sympathizers, online supporters and passive members. The clubs mainly target young white men in their late teens and twenties.
Since 2020, Active Clubs have expanded rapidly across the United States, Canada and Europe, including the U.K., France, Sweden and Finland. Precise numbers are hard to verify, but the clubs appear to be spreading, according to The Counter Extremism Project, the Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Poverty Law Center and my own research.
The clubs reportedly operate in at least 25 U.S. states, and potentially as many as 34. Active U.S. chapters reportedly increased from 49 in 2023 to 78 in 2025.
The clubs’ rise reflects a broader shift in white supremacist strategy, away from formal organizations and social movements. In 2020, American neo-Nazi Robert Rundo introduced the concept of “White Nationalism 3.0” – a decentralized, branded and fitness-based approach to extremist organizing.
Rundo previously founded the Rise Above Movement, which was a violent, far-right extremist group in the U.S. known for promoting white nationalist ideology, organizing street fights and coordinating through social media. The organization carried out attacks at protests and rallies from 2016 through 2018.
Active Clubs embed their ideology within apolitical activities such as martial arts and weightlifting. This model allows them to blend in with mainstream fitness communities. However, their deeper purpose is to prepare members for racial conflict.
 ‘You need to learn how to fight’

Active Club messaging glorifies discipline, masculinity and strength – a “warrior identity” designed to attract young men.
“The active club is not so much a structural organization as it is a lifestyle for those willing to work, risk and sweat to embody our ideals for themselves and to promote them to others,” Rundo explained via his Telegram channel.
“They never were like, ‘You need to learn how to fight so you can beat up people of color.’ It was like, ‘You need to learn how to fight because people want to kill you in the future,’” a former Active Club member told Vice News in 2023.
These cells are deliberately small – often under a dozen members – and self-contained, which gives them greater operational security and flexibility. Each club operates semi-autonomously while remaining connected to the broader ideology and digital network.
 Expanding globally and deepening ties

Active Clubs maintain strategic and ideological connections with formal white supremacist groups, including Patriot Front, a white nationalist and neofascist group founded in 2017 by Thomas Rousseau after the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Active Clubs share extremist beliefs with these organizations, including racial hierarchy and the “Great Replacement” theory, which claims white populations are being deliberately replaced by nonwhite immigrants. While publicly presenting as fitness groups, they may collaborate with white supremacist groups on recruitment, training, propaganda or public events.
Figures connected to accelerationist groups – organizations that seek to create social chaos and societal collapse that they believe will lead to a race war and the destruction of liberal democracy – played a role in founding the Active Club network. Along with the Rise Above Movement, they include Atomwaffen Division and another neo-Nazi group, The Base – organizations that repackage violent fascism to appeal to disaffected young white men in the U.S.
 Brotherhood as a cover

By downplaying explicit hate symbols and emphasizing strength and preparedness, Active Clubs appeal to a new generation of recruits who may not initially identify with overt racism but are drawn to a culture of hypermasculinity and self-improvement.
Anyone can start a local Active Club chapter with minimal oversight. This autonomy makes it hard for law enforcement agencies to monitor the groups and helps the network grow rapidly.
Shared branding and digital propaganda maintain ideological consistency. Through this approach, Active Clubs have built a transnational network of echo chambers, recruitment pipelines and paramilitary-style training in parks and gyms.
Club members engage in activities such as combat sports training, propaganda dissemination and ideological conditioning. Fight sessions are often recorded and shared online as recruitment tools.
Members distribute flyers, stickers and online content to spread white supremacist messages. Active Clubs embed themselves in local communities by hosting events, promoting physical fitness, staging public actions and sharing propaganda.
Potential members first see propaganda on encrypted apps such as Telegram or on social media. The clubs recruit in person at gyms, protests and local events, vetting new members to ensure they share the group’s beliefs and can be trusted to maintain secrecy.
 From fringe to functioning network

Based on current information from the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, there are 187 active chapters within the Active Club Network across 27 countries – a 25% increase from late 2023. The Crowd Counting Consortium documented 27 protest events involving Active Clubs in 2022-2023.
However, precise membership numbers remain difficult to ascertain. Some groups call themselves “youth clubs” but share similar ideas and aesthetics and engage in similar activities.
Active Club members view themselves as defenders of Western civilization and masculine virtue. From their perspective, their activities represent noble resistance rather than hate. Members are encouraged to stay secretive, prepare for societal collapse and build a network of committed, fit men ready to act through infiltration, activism or violence.
 Hiding in plain sight

Law enforcement agencies, researchers and civil society now face a new kind of domestic threat that wears workout clothes instead of uniforms.
Active Clubs work across international borders, bound by shared ideas and tactics and a common purpose. This is the new white nationalism: decentralized, modernized, more agile and disguised as self-improvement. What appears to be a harmless workout group may be a gateway to violent extremism, one pushup at a time.

Babies and children in the United States are nearly twice as likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with their peers in other wealthy countries, according to a new study.
The health of U.S. children has deteriorated since the early 2000s across a range of measures, researchers from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of California, Los Angeles found. They published their findings last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The study compared infant and child deaths in the U.S. with the figures from 18 other high-income nations between 2007 to 2023.
U.S. infants, children and teens were about 1.8 times more likely to die before reaching adulthood compared with young people in peer countries, researchers discovered.
For babies, the two causes of death with the biggest gaps between the U.S. and the other countries were prematurity — being born too early — and sudden unexpected infant death.
For children and teens, the biggest gaps were in firearm-related incidents and car crashes.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Since 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teens. Firearm death rates among U.S. kids have more than doubled since 2013.
Many of the deaths from prematurity, firearms and sudden unexplained infant death are preventable, three physicians argued in an op-ed published after the new report.
Those three causes of death are up to four times more likely among Black youth than their white counterparts.
The authors estimated the mortality gap between the U.S. and other countries claimed the lives of nearly 316,000 children and teens between 2007 and 2023.
The study also found that rates of chronic conditions including obesity, early puberty, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, depressive symptoms and loneliness all increased in children during the study period.
Overall, Americans have a lower life expectancy and worse health outcomes than residents of other wealthy  countries, even though the U.S. spends nearly twice as much on health care, relative to its gross domestic product.
To improve infant and child health, the authors of the op-ed proposed antipoverty measures such as child tax credits; social media restrictions; broader health insurance coverage; more investment in primary care; and more restrictive firearm laws.

Americans spend tens of billions of dollars on hidden or surprise “junk fees” that deceptively raise costs beyond advertised prices.
The post ‘Junk fees’ unfairly rob consumers. New regulations banning them go into effect today.   appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IT’S MOVE-IN season in Massachusetts, and you may have just seen an ad for a studio apartment for $2,500 per month. That amount is going to stretch your budget, but recognizing how competitive the housing market is, you know you need to jump on that rental quickly.  
So, you head to the management office the very next day to sign your lease. Just before signing, you notice the amount you’d have to pay every month will actually be $2,750 – beyond what you have budgeted for rent. The extra $250 comes from a mandatory “trash pick-up” fee combined with a vague “amenities” fee. You don’t want to start the daunting apartment search process over again, so you sign the lease. But the entire process leaves you feeling misled and paying more than you originally anticipated. 
We hear these stories often. If it’s not apartment fees tacked on at the last minute, it’s “resort fees” at a hotel, “convenience fees” when you purchase a ticket, or “processing fees” when checking out online.  
These fees are not simply an inconvenience – they’re a widespread, costly problem impacting all of us. Every year, Americans spend tens of billions of dollars on hidden or surprise “junk fees” that deceptively raise costs beyond advertised prices. As consumers face rising costs of living, these pesky fees quietly drain consumers’ wallets.  
This is why, as attorney general, I’ve used my authority to enact nation-leading, economy-wide consumer protection regulations making it clear that “junk fees” are prohibited under Massachusetts law.  
Effective today – these regulations are for every person who’s had their budgeting blown apart by last-minute “surprises,” for every parent who’s had to explain to their child why the gift they promised is now out of their price range, and so many more. 
Amidst an ongoing affordability crisis, these new rules will require businesses to disclose the full price of their goods and services upfront. No more misleading price advertising. No more burying fees at the end of a transaction.  
These regulations go beyond just requiring upfront pricing for one-off purchases. They’ll also help consumers more easily cancel or avoid unwanted costs related to trial offers, automatic renewals, and subscriptions – like gym memberships and meal delivery services. They’ll make it so that a 7-day free trial for an online streaming service won’t quietly turn into $150 in monthly charges without notice. They’ll ensure that you’re able to cancel that unwanted subscription the same way you signed up for it – online, not by mail. 
The regulations will also help level the playing field for businesses by allowing potential customers to more accurately compare prices while shopping. That way, the next time you go shopping in Massachusetts, you’ll know exactly how much something costs, excluding taxes and shipping charges, before you decide to check-out. And no business will be allowed to hide those fees until the last moment before purchase. 
Massachusetts has long been on the forefront of consumer protection, having some of the strongest laws in the country. And my office’s “junk fee” regulations are just one way we’ve built upon that legacy. Unlike many other state or federal counterparts, our “junk fee” regulations will apply broadly across industries and businesses operating in Massachusetts – making them stronger, bolder, and truly nation-leading.  
As the current federal administration steps back from consumer protection – as evidenced by its efforts to dismantle one of the nation’s chief financial watchdogs, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – we have and will continue to step up.  
If you believe you’ve experienced an unfair or deceptive “junk fee,” you may file a consumer complaint with my office online at mass.gov/ago. And more information regarding our “junk fee” regulations, including guidance to help businesses comply with the new rules, is available online at mass.gov/ago/junkfees. 
Today, we turn the page on “junk fees” and deceptive costs. Today, the price you see is the price you pay.

(Taylor Sisk for KFF Health News)Rebecca Kasen has seen and heard things in recent years in and around Michigan’s capital city that she never would have expected.
“It’s a very weird time in our lives,” said Kasen, executive director of the Women’s Center of Greater Lansing.
Last November, a group of people were captured on surveillance video early one morning mocking a “Black Lives Matter” sign in the front window of the center, with one of them vandalizing its free pantry. That same fall, Women’s Center staff reported being harassed.
A couple of blocks down East Michigan Avenue, Strange Matter Coffee, which supports progressive causes in the community, has been confronted by “First Amendment auditors” outside its storefront. Some toted guns or cameras, sometimes chanting slogans supporting President Donald Trump, generally unnerving customers and staff, Kasen said.
In many cases, extremist activities and conduct throughout the U.S. over the past few years have been driven by the deepening chasm of political partisanship and disinformation-driven rebellion against responses to the Covid-19 pandemic. More recently, backlash against immigration and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives has heightened tensions.
Last year, the Southern Poverty Law Center documented 1,371 hate and extremist groups nationwide sowing unrest through a wide range of tactics, sometimes violent. Over the last several years, the group writes, the political right has increasingly shifted toward “an authoritarian, patriarchal Christian supremacy dedicated to eroding the value of inclusive democracy and public institutions.”
Researchers at American University’s Polarization & Extremism Research & Innovation Lab, or PERIL, say that in online spaces, “hate is intersectional.” (For example, Pasha Dashtgard, PERIL’s director of research, explains, platforms dedicated to male supremacy are often also decidedly antisemitic.) Seemingly innocuous discussions erupt into vitriol: The release of “A Minecraft Movie” prompted tirades against an alleged trend toward casting Black women and nonbinary people.
The continued escalations drove staffers at PERIL and the Southern Poverty Law Center to approach the problem from a different angle: Treat extremism as a public health problem. Community Advisory, Resource, and Education Centers are now operating in Lansing, Michigan, and Athens, Georgia, offering training, support, referrals, and resources to communities affected by hate, discrimination, and supremacist ideologies and to people susceptible to radicalization, with a focus on young people.
The team defines extremism as the belief that one’s group is in direct and bitter conflict with another of a different identity — ideology, race, gender identity, or expression — fomenting an us-versus-them mentality mired in the conviction that resolution can come only through separation, domination, or extermination.
Researchers who study extremism say that, as the federal government terminates grants for violence prevention, state governments and local communities are recognizing they’re on their own. (CARE receives no federal funding.)
Aaron Flanagan, the Southern Poverty Law Center’s deputy director for prevention and partnerships, said his organization and PERIL came together about five years ago to examine a shared research question: What would it take to create a nationally scalable model to prevent youth radicalization, one that’s rooted in communities and provides solutions residents trust?
They looked to a decades-old German counterextremism model called mobile advisory centers. The objective is to equip “all levels of civil society with the skills and knowledge to recognize extremism” and to engage in conversations about addressing it, Dashtgard said.
“We’re not about, ‘How do you respond to a group of Patriot Front people marching through your town?’” Pete Kurtz-Glovas, who until June served as PERIL’s deputy director for regional partnerships, explained during a training in January. “Rather, ‘How do you respond when your son or a member of your congregation expresses some of these extremist ideas?’”
Tim McVeigh
Michigan has long been considered fertile ground for extremism. Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, convicted of the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, were associated with a militia group in the state. Some of the men charged in 2020 in the plot to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer had ties to a militia group calling itself the Wolverine Watchmen.
The state’s capital city and adjacent East Lansing, where Michigan State University is, are relatively progressive but have seen conflict.
Will Verchereau has a vivid recollection from the early days of the pandemic: a pickup truck speeding down the street in their Lansing neighborhood, a Confederate flag flying from it, music blasting, later joining a rolling protest that clogged streets around the Capitol to protest Whitmer’s covid lockdown directives.
Incrementally, the community has responded to these expressions of extremism. After the confrontations at Strange Matter Coffee, Verchereau, a board member of the Salus Center, which advocates for and supports the LGBTQ+ community, said people banded together to talk about “how to be safe in those moments; how to de-escalate when and where possible.”
The CARE initiative reinforces such efforts. The centers offer tool kits catered to specific audiences. Among them are a parent and caregiver guide to online radicalization, a community guide to youth radicalization, and “Not Just a Joke: Understanding & Preventing Gender- & Sexuality-Based Bigotry.”
Flanagan said the team views this public health model as separate from but complementary to law enforcement interventions. The goal is to have law enforcement as minimally engaged as possible — to detect nascent warning signs and address them before police get involved.
The resources help identify conditions that can make people more susceptible to manipulation by extremists, such as unaddressed behavioral health issues and vulnerabilities, including having experienced trauma or the loss of a loved one.
Lansing resident Erin Buitendorp witnessed protesters, some of them armed, flood the state Capitol building during the pandemic over lockdown and masking orders. She’s a proponent of the public health approach. It’s “providing people with agency and a strategy to move forward,” she said. It’s a way to channel energy “and feel like you can actually create change with community.”
Lansing and Athens were chosen for a number of reasons, including their proximity to universities that could serve as partners — and to rural communities.
In the small town of Howell, 40 miles southeast of Lansing, protesters waived Nazi flags outside a production of the play “The Diary of Anne Frank” at an American Legion post.
In nearby DeWitt, the local school district proposed a mini lesson on pronouns for a first grade class that involved reading the picture book “They She He Me: Free to Be!” Threats against school staff followed and officials canceled the lesson. Since then, the CARE team has helped provide support to teachers there in holding conversations on contentious topics in classrooms and in dealing with skeptical parents.
“It’s really important that rural communities not be left behind,” Flanagan said. “They persistently are in America, and then they’re often simultaneously demonized for some of the most extreme, or extremist, political problems and challenges.”
National plans
The CARE team hopes to expand its program nationwide. Similar public health initiatives have been launched elsewhere, including Boston Children’s Hospital’s Trauma and Community Resilience Center and the DEEP program, run by New York City’s Citizens Crime Commission.
And in June a new tool, the Reach Out Resource Hub, went live, offering guidance to help prevent violent extremism.
Pete Simi, a professor of sociology at Chapman University and a leading expert on extremism, sees a daunting task ahead, with extremism’s having become more mainstream over the past 25 years. “It’s just devastating,” he said. “It’s really startling.”
Simi said that while there was previously talk of shifts in the Overton window, the range of ideas considered politically acceptable to mainstream society, “I would say now it has been completely shattered.” Violent extremists now feel “unshackled, supported by a new administration that has their back.”
“We are in a more dangerous time now than any other in my lifetime,” Simi said.
The Rev. Pippin Whitaker ministers the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens in Georgia, which last year received a package of ammunition in the mail with no note included. She embraces framing extremism, and people’s lack of awareness of it, as a public health issue.
“If you have a germ out there,” Whitaker said, “and people aren’t aware that if you wash your hands you can protect yourself, and that it’s an actual problem, you won’t enact basic protective behavior.”

The Boston Globe reported recently that a small group of neo-Nazis gathered outside the New Hampshire State House in Concord. Wearing facemasks, they held a banner proclaiming “Trump loves Epstein.” Were they saying this was a good thing? Or were they protesting? What about Nazis’ historical hatred of Jews? Who knows? It was impossible to read their expressions, because they all wore masks.
A posted scholarly lecture on the Virginia Museum of History and Culture’s website tells us that early KKK members wore burlap feed sacks over the faces, donned animal horns and wore white muslin masks to indicate they were “non-human,” including corpses come back to life. Who were these members of the nation’s first domestic terrorism group? The neighbors of the people they hunted? How did they feel about what they were doing? Who knows? It was impossible to read their expressions, because they all wore masks.

Christine Palm
Today, all across the country, masked men, claiming to be representatives of the U.S. government, are snatching people off the streets, out of courtrooms, off high school ballfields, and from the lines of workers in car washes. Are they employed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement? Are they self-appointed vigilantes? Are they sex traffickers acting under cover to kidnap people for sex slavery? Who knows? It is impossible to read their expressions, because they all wear masks.
Hiding one’s face is, of course, an ancient practice. Humans have always worn masks — in war and sports, in religious ritual, during celebrations, and on stage. Shakespeare’s lovers donned them at masquerade balls. Bad guys like Darth Vader and Jason Voorhees wear masks. But so do good guys like Batman, Spiderman and Zorro. Complex anti-heroes like the Phantom of the Opera maintain their mystery behind a mask. And of course children love the strange, freeing anonymity a mask gives them at Hallowe’en.
Most of us — those who respect science and were concerned for others’ safety — wore masks for three long years during the Covid pandemic. And we were thrilled to toss them once the vaccine allowed life to return to normal. Some folks with compromised immune systems choose to wear them still, especially in crowds.
But now? For those of us not still at grave risk, or on a sport team, in a religious group or on stage, the main reason to cover one’s face is to hide our shame. Our hands instinctively fly up to our cheeks and cover our nose and mouth when we are caught doing something wrong, or embarrassing.
So a simple question for ICE agents (both real and impostors), for neo-Nazis, and for today’s white supremacists posting hateful literature on lampposts in small towns across the nation, is this: if you’re too ashamed to show your face, why are you doing what you’re doing?
People in public office (as I once was) are often stalked, harassed and ridiculed on social media. Sometimes, as in the tragic case of the state representative in Minnesota, they are murdered. The public expects elected officials to show their faces, literally and figuratively. It’s called accountability. And yes, often it puts a target on our back, as it has recently with Rep. Corey Paris, who is being sent the most racist, vile and dangerous threats from across the country for calling out ICE in his district. Still, I don’t know any elected person hiding behind a mask, unless you considerTrump’s orange make-up a bizarre version of kumadori, the stylized makeup worn in Japanese Kabuki theater.
In 2016, at a protest march I attended after Trump was first elected, I engaged a young man who seemed to be in his mid-20s. He wore a Trump tee-shirt and was heckling us from the sidelines. I asked why he was covering his face with a mask. He said something that cannot be reprinted here — something inspired by Trump’s boasting about what he does to women’s bodies. He spat out he would do that to me if I didn’t move on.
So I asked him what his mother would think of that. Yes, I admit, a prissy, perhaps uptight thing to do, but still. I wanted him to explain his thought process. After all, aren’t we liberals supposed to engage with these folks? To get to know their minds? Not to judge but, rather, to “meet them where they are?”
So instead of returning this threat with something similar about his private parts (which, as everyone knows, are a lot more fragile than a woman’s), I asked again: Does your mother know you’re doing this? He emitted a sort of grunt. I could not read his expression, because he wore a mask. But he did drop his shoulders a little, and bowed his head just a bit. The parade of marchers moved on.
I think of that young man often — he’s probably around 30 now. Plenty old enough to be a father to a child who may get measles. Perhaps his mother now has cancer and needs to enter a clinical trial that’s been defunded. Perhaps the tariffs have cost him his job. I wonder if the mask will fall from his face when the scales fall from his eyes.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont spoke to more than 6,500 people in Portland on Labor Day, endorsing union-backed candidates for the U.S. Senate and governor who made pitches to create a government that serves workers and everyday people, not billionaires. 
Graham Platner, the oysterman challenging long-time Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, and Troy Jackson, former president of the Maine Senate and fifth-generation logger from Allagash, joined Sanders at the “Fighting Oligarchy” rally to appeal to widespread concerns about affordability.
While repeating common critiques made by other Democrats against President Donald Trump’s administration for providing tax cuts for the wealthy while stripping funding for health care, education and other programs essential to the working class, the trio also stood up for causes moderates have avoided, such as championing tribal rights and calling for an end to the humanitarian crisis driven by Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. 
“This is an unprecedented, and in fact, dangerous moment in American history,” Sanders told the crowd, with local union workers seated behind him on stage. “We have got to respond in an unprecedented way, and the way we respond is to build a kind of strong, progressive, grassroots movement, the likes of which this country has never seen.”

An anti-establishment pitch 
Portland resident Ken Bailey, a 76-year-old former member of the U.S. Air Force who joined the anti-war movement in the 1970s, sees that as more possible now than ever in his life.
Bailey considers himself a democratic socialist, like Sanders, who Bailey has been a fan of since he was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont in 1981. 
“That win knocked me off my feet,” Bailey said. But, then, he hadn’t imagined the more widespread embrace of democratic socialist ideas he’s now seeing — pointing out the range of attendees: others like himself adorning grey beards, parents with their children on their hips, college students. 
He also sees momentum beyond Maine, notably Zohran Mamdani’s primary win for New York mayor. Platner’s campaign has ties to Mamdani’s, as the two share progressive strategists with records of successfully running against establishment Democrats.
While Graham and Jackson are Democrats, they used their speeches to separate their candidacies from the establishment. 
“We have tried it their way and it doesn’t work,” Jackson said. “It’s time for regular folks to take the wheel. Hell, we built the wheel.”
Platner sees the path forward in the legacies of the labor movement and the Civil Rights Movement: “legacies of building power,” as he put it.
“Let’s be clear: we do not live in a system that is broken,” Platner said. “We live in a system that is functioning exactly as it is intended.” 
The United States is already living in an oligarchy, Sanders said, because the top 1% of earners control the economy and politicians. 
“It is not just Republicans,” he said. “It is also the fact that billionaires play a much too significant role in the Democratic Party as well.”
Sanders specifically took aim at the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2010 that allowed corporations and other outside groups to spend unlimited money on elections. Mainers have backed campaign finance reforms several times, including in the past two general elections, but the laws have been stalled in the courts. 
But Sanders said he, and he believes attendees, have a vision for a government “of the people,” he said, and the crowd responded, “for the people.”

Maine’s ‘affordability crisis’
The speeches also focused on the economy, specifically the struggle for Mainers to afford housing, child care and other costs that have continued to increase.
“People my age and younger are being driven out of this state by an affordability crisis,” said Platner, who is 40.
That’s the reality for Sophie Creamer, 25, who grew up in Brunswick and now attends college in Massachusetts. Creamer, who is not enrolled with any political party, said they worry about being able to move back to Maine due to the lack of available and affordable housing. Creamer is also concerned about access to health care, as someone who relies on MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program.
While Democrats’ planks often include bringing down the cost of living, Creamer thinks progressive Democrats like those on stage in Portland Monday night are needed to push the establishment to actually change the status quo. 
Jackson said he’s running for people like Jordyn Rossignol of Caribou. Rossignol said she drained her savings to make payroll for her childcare center, Miss Jordyn’s Child Development Center, but financial reasons ultimately led to its closure and around 100 children who lost care in 2023. 
Taking the stage to express her support for the candidates, Rossignol pointed to Jackson’s work championing child care reform as the former president of the Maine Senate and called Platner “a working man, a leader and someone who won’t just say he’s concerned. He will act,” referring to the oft-repeated critique of Collins’ statements of concern.  
Gigi Larrc drove from Unity to support Jackson, handing out signs to attendees. She supports him over other candidates in the crowded governor’s race because she “does not believe in political dynasties,” she said, referring to Hannah Pingree and Angus King III, who are the children of some of Maine’s current members of Congress. Jackson’s working class background appeals to her.
“When Troy is working on getting our bread-and-butter needs met, it comes from a place of solidarity, not charity,” Larrc said.
Not all attendees knew who their gubernatorial or Senate choices will be. 
Nicole Petrin and Renee Marsh from Biddeford said they attended the event to hear Sanders speak, but they were “in the market” when it came to voting for governor. Their top priority, Petrin said, was not voting for a rich politician, or someone who is backed by rich people.
The fact that Jackson was endorsed by Sanders, however, would be “a huge deal,” in their decision, both said.

In our fast-changing world, few technological developments of recent years have had a bigger impact on young people than the emergence of instant communication and social media. And while it’s not difficult to identify the positive impacts of these phenomena, the worrisome impacts are also numerous. And this is a trend that seems certain to intensify in years to come with the rapid rise of artificial intelligence.
Thankfully, many advocates have started to speak out in favor of stronger laws to protect vulnerable people – especially young people – from exploitation like predatory algorithms, social media bullying, artificial intelligence and other impacts from the online world that endanger people’s mental and even physical health. And recently NC Newsline caught up with the leader of one such group, the co-founder and executive director of the Young People’s Alliance, North Carolinian Sam Hiner.

(Photo by Barry Brecheisen/Getty Images for American Foundation for Suicide Prevention)This article first appeared on KFF Health News. If you or someone you know may be experiencing a mental health crisis, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting “988.”
On July 17, the option shut down for LGBTQ+ youth to access specialized mental health support from the national 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said a month earlier that it would no longer “silo” services and would instead “focus on serving all help seekers.” That meant the elimination of the “Press 3” option, the dedicated line answered by staff specifically trained to handle LGBTQ+ youth facing mental health issues ranging from anxiety to thoughts of suicide.
Now, states such as California, Colorado, Illinois and Nevada are scrambling to backfill LGBTQ+ crisis support through training, fees and other initiatives in response to what advocates say is the Trump administration’s hostile stance toward this group. In his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump issued an executive order recognizing only two sexes, male and female, and while campaigning, he condemned gender ideology as “toxic poison.” And the administration omitted “T” for transgender and “Q” for queer or questioning in announcing the elimination of the 988 Press 3 option.
New Mexico’s 988 lifeline still offers LGTBQ+ option

“Since the election, we’ve seen a clear increase in young people feeling devalued, erased, uncertain about their future, and seeing resources taken away,” said Becca Nordeen, senior vice president of crisis intervention at The Trevor Project, a national suicide prevention and crisis intervention nonprofit for LGBTQ+ youth.
Nordeen and other advocates for at-risk kids who helped staff the dedicated line said it has never been more critical for what The Trevor Project estimates are 5.2 million LGBTQ+ people ages 13-24 across the U.S. About 39% of LGBTQ+ young people seriously consider attempting suicide each year, including roughly half of transgender and nonbinary young people, according to a 2023 survey, reflecting a disproportionately high rate of risk.
The use of the dedicated line for LGBTQ+ youth had steadily increased, according to data from the federal substance abuse agency, with nearly 1.6 million calls, texts or online chats since its rollout in October 2022, out of approximately 16.7 million contacts to the general line. The Press 3 option reached record monthly highs in May and June. In 2024, contacts to the line peaked in November, the month of the election.
Call-takers on the general 988 line do not necessarily have the specialized training that the staff on the Press 3 line had, causing fear among LGBTQ+ advocates that they don’t have the right context or language to support youth experiencing crises related to sexuality and gender.
“If a counselor doesn’t know what the concept of coming out is, or being outed, or the increased likelihood of family rejection and how those bring stressors and anxiety, it can inadvertently prevent the trust from being immediately built,” said Mark Henson, The Trevor Project’s interim vice president of advocacy and government affairs, adding that creating that trust at the beginning of calls was a critical “bridge for a youth in crisis to go forward.”

The White House’s Office of Management and Budget did not immediately respond to questions about why the Press 3 option was shut down, but spokesperson Rachel Cauley told NBC News that the department’s budget would not “grant taxpayer money to a chat service where children are encouraged to embrace radical gender ideology by ‘counselors’ without consent or knowledge of their parents.”
Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement: “Continued funding of the Press 3 option threatened to put the entire 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in danger of massive reductions in service.”
When someone calls 988, they are routed to a local crisis center if they are calling from a cellphone carrier that uses “georouting” — a process that routes calls based on approximate areas — unless they select one of the specialized services offered through the national network. While the Press 3 option is officially no longer part of that menu of options, which includes Spanish-language and veterans’ services, states can step in to increase training for their local crisis centers or establish their own options for specialized services.
California is among the states attempting to fill the new service gap, with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office announcing a partnership with The Trevor Project to provide training on LGBTQ+ youth issues for the crisis counselors in the state who answer calls to the general 988 crisis line. The state signed a $700,000 contract with the organization for the training program.
The Trevor Project’s Henson said the details still need to be figured out, including evaluating the training needs of California’s current 988 counselors. The partnership comes as the organization’s own 24/7 crisis line for LGBTQ+ youth faces a crisis of its own: The Trevor Project was one of several providers paid by the federal government to staff the Press 3 option, and the elimination of the service cut the organization’s capacity significantly, according to Henson.
Gordon Coombes, director of Colorado’s 988 hotline, said staff there are increasing outreach to let the public know that the general 988 service hasn’t gone away, even with the loss of the Press 3 option, and that its call-takers welcome calls from the LGBTQ+ population. Staff are promoting services at concerts, community events and Rockies baseball games.
Coombes said the Colorado Behavioral Health Administration contracts with Solari Crisis & Human Services to answer 988 calls, and that the training had already been equipping call-takers on the general line to support LGBTQ+ young people.
The state supports the 988 services via a 7-cent annual fee on cellphone lines. Coombes said the department requested an increase in the fee to bolster its services. While the additional funds would benefit all 988 operations, the request was made in part because of the elimination of the Press 3 option, he said.

Nevada plans to ensure that all 988 crisis counselors get training on working with LGBTQ+ callers, according to state health department spokesperson Daniel Vezmar. Vezmar said Nevada’s $50 million investment in a new call center last November would help increase call capacity, and that the state’s Division of Public and Behavioral Health would monitor the impact of the closure of the Press 3 option and make changes as needed.
The Illinois Department of Human Services announced after the Press 3 option’s termination that it was working to train existing call center counselors on supporting LGBTQ+ youth and promoting related affirming messages and imagery in its outreach about the 988 line. A July increase in a state telecommunications tax will help fund expanded efforts, and the agency is exploring additional financial options to fill in the new gap.
Kelly Crosbie, director of North Carolina’s Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Use Services, said the division has recently invested in partnerships with community organizations to increase mental health support for marginalized groups, including LGBTQ+ populations, through the state’s 988 call center and other programs.
“We’ve wanted to make sure we were beefing up the services,” Crosbie said, noting that North Carolina’s Republican legislature continues to restrict health care for transgender youth.
Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said Congress could put the funding for the LGBTQ+ line in any final appropriations bill it passes. She also said states could individually codify permanent funding for an LGBTQ+ option, the way Washington state has created and funded a “Press 4” option for its Native American population to reach crisis counselors who are tribal members or descendants trained in cultural practices. The state created the option by carving out some of its 988 funding. No state has publicly announced a plan to make such an investment for LGBTQ+ populations.
Federal lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have spoken out against the closure of the LGBTQ+ 988 option and urged that it be reinstated. At a July press conference alongside Democratic colleagues, Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican who represents part of New York’s Hudson Valley, said he and Republican Rep. Young Kim of Orange County, California, wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., urging him to reverse course and keep the LGBTQ+ line.
“What we must agree on is that when a child is in crisis — when they are alone, when they are afraid, when they are unsure of where to turn to, when they are contemplating suicide — they need access to help right away,” Lawler said. “Regardless of where you stand on these issues, as Americans, as people, we must all agree there is purpose and worth to each and every life.”

Many in the wildland fire community believe the leadership team managing the fire sent crews into an ambush by federal immigration agents. (Facebook/Bear Gulch Fire 2025)Wildland firefighters were stunned when federal immigration authorities last week raided an active wildfire response in Washington state, arresting two firefighters and sidelining crews for hours.
Wildfire veterans say the operation was nearly unprecedented, a breach in longstanding protocol that federal agents don’t disrupt emergency responders to check immigration status.
Worse, many wildfire veterans believe the management team overseeing the fire crews played a key role in handing over the firefighters to immigration authorities.
Stateline spoke to nearly a dozen firefighters, agency staffers and contractors familiar with the incident, who shared their belief that the top officials assigned to the fire deployed the crews to a remote location under false pretenses so federal agents could check their immigration status. Most of them spoke privately for fear of retaliation.
The raid has reverberated among fire crews, agency leaders and contractors. Wildfire veterans say the arrests have stoked fear and distrust among firefighters on the ground. They worry that crews may be scared to deploy if they may become a target for immigration raids.
“There’s really no way [the wildfire management team] could not have been involved,” said Riva Duncan, a former wildland fire chief who served more than 30 years with the U.S. Forest Service. “We’re all talking about it. People are wondering if they go on a fire with this team, if that could happen to them.”
Since the incident became public, the wildfire world has been abuzz with anger at that team — California Interagency Incident Management Team 7. Made up of federal, state and local fire professionals, the team was assigned to oversee the response to the Bear Gulch fire, which has burned 9,000 acres in and around Olympic National Park in Washington state.
One firefighter who was present at the raid said he is convinced that Team 7 leaders sent their crews into a trap.
“I felt beyond betrayed,” said the firefighter, who requested anonymity to protect his career. “What they did was messed up. They’d been talking in their briefings about building relationships and trust. For them to say that and then go do this is mind-boggling. It boiled my blood.”
Team 7 Incident Commander Tom Clemo, in an email, declined to comment, citing an active investigation. Tom Stokesberry, the team’s public information officer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to daily Incident Action Plans filed by Team 7 and posted online, the crews had previously been digging holding lines, working to protect structures and conducting mop-up work. The two crews targeted by federal agents had not been assigned to work together in the days leading up to the raid.
Then, on Aug. 27, both crews — workers from private companies contracted to help fight the fire — were told to deploy to a staging area where they would cut firewood for the local community. The firefighter who was present at the raid told Stateline that a division supervisor told the crews he would meet them at the site, but never showed up.
After arriving at the site, the firefighter said, the crews found piles of logs, seemingly from a timber operation. Not wanting to damage a logging company’s property, they waited for a management team leader to show up with further instructions.
After an hour, unmarked law enforcement vehicles pulled up to the site and federal officials began questioning the firefighters. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said immigration agents would not have been able to access the site without help from Team 7 leaders.
“Fire areas are officially closed, very secure and there are roadblocks,” she said. “Somebody would have had to tell these agents how to get there.”
In a news release, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said its agents assisted with an investigation led by the federal Bureau of Land Management. While the agency’s release did not mention the nature of the investigation, multiple wildfire sources said the feds claimed they had uncovered fraud on time cards submitted by the crews.
Table Rock Forestry Inc., an Oregon-based company whose crew was one of the two at the scene, was allegedly subjected to the raid due to a half-hour discrepancy on a time sheet, said Scott Polhamus, secretary of the Organization of Fire Contractors and Affiliates. Table Rock Forestry is a member of the fire contractors’ group.
Multiple wildfire veterans said that time card discrepancies are not uncommon at wildfires, where crews work long days and it’s not always clear if lunch breaks or errands in town count toward working hours. Such mix-ups are typically sorted out between organizational leaders. Calling law enforcement in such a scenario is almost unheard of.
“This is not the first time a crew has been called on the carpet for maybe padding their time a bit,” Duncan said. “You deal directly with the company. It’s just absolutely mind-boggling to treat it as a criminal issue.”
After about five minutes discussing the time card issue, according to the firefighter who was present at the raid, federal agents spent the next three hours checking each firefighter’s immigration status.
The Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the immigration arrests made no mention of time sheets or any evidence that the investigation had turned up fraud. It did state that the two companies whose crews were raided had their contracts terminated by the government.
Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group, said that claim is false. While the crews were demobilized and sent home, the feds have not actually ended the companies’ contracts or ability to accept future deployments.
A Customs and Border Protection public affairs specialist did not immediately respond to questions about the investigation, the alleged fraud or federal agents’ coordination with Team 7.
The Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the state’s lead wildfire response agency, said federal officials did not notify their state counterparts about the investigation.
“DNR was not informed of the incident until well after the fact,” said Ryan Rodruck, wildfire on-call public information officer with the agency.
Rodruck noted that the fire response was under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. Press officers with the Forest Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Multiple wildfire sources said the crews would not have been sent to the staging area where they were ambushed without the knowledge of top leaders on the fire’s management team.
The two crews that were raided have a diverse mix of firefighters, many of them Hispanic. One of the crews has many foreign workers who are legally in the country on H-2B visas. Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter, said it was likely not a coincidence that two crews with many brown-skinned members were targeted in the raid.
Two of the firefighters were arrested, federal officials said, for being in the country illegally.
One of the firefighters who was arrested is represented by Innovation Law Lab, an Oregon-based legal group that defends refugees and immigrants. Isa Peña, the group’s director of strategy, said the Department of Homeland Security has not revealed the whereabouts of their client.
The firefighter, who Peña declined to name, has been in the U.S. since he was four years old and served as a firefighter for the past three years. He has been waiting since 2017 for a response to a U-visa application, which protects victims of serious crimes who assist federal investigators, according to letter from the law firm to U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon.
Immigration advocates are alarmed that the raid was potentially arranged by California Interagency Incident Management Team 7, the leaders charged with overseeing the wildfire response.
“There certainly is concern if that is the case that individuals are being handed over to immigration as they’re trying to keep our communities safe,” Peña said. “Conducting immigration enforcement while brave members of our community are risking their lives to protect us is really disgusting.”
Several wildland fire veterans also noted that the raid took place on Team 7’s final day in charge of the fire response, hours before a Washington team rotated in to take command. The California team headed home and left the new team to face the media scrutiny and angry firefighters in camp.
“If you’ve got ICE teams pulling your contractors out, you’d want to cut and run as soon as you can,” Polhamus said.
On a forum for wildland fire professionals on the social media platform Reddit, many expressed anger at Team 7. Firefighters also took issue with the assertion, shared by federal immigration officials, that the raid did not disrupt firefighting operations.
“It’s total bulls***,” said Duncan, the former Forest Service firefighter. “Whoever made that statement doesn’t understand the work. To take two crews off of a fire that’s only 13% contained, that seems ridiculous at that point in a fire. That does seem very unusual.”
Many wildfire veterans said that conducting a raid at the site of an active wildfire was reckless and irresponsible.
“Having people on the line that you don’t expect to be there is an issue,” said Polhamus, with the fire contractors’ group. “When you need crews and you are taking resources to check them for immigration status, we can all think of better ways to address that.”
Duncan said she’s spoken with firefighters still assigned to the Bear Gulch fire who are disgusted with the situation and want to leave.
“The three principal wildland fire values are duty, respect, integrity,” she said. “Utmost in that is taking care of your people. If you can’t trust the people you’re working with when things get hairy, that’s a concern.”
In Washington and Oregon, elected leaders have decried the raids and are pushing for more information on the status of the firefighters who were arrested. Federal immigration officials have said little since the news release announcing the arrests.
