Thousands of Vermonters joined more than 40 planned events on Saturday during the state’s second round of “No Kings” protests, which oppose the Trump administration. Photographers Glenn Russell, Jeb Wallace-Brodeur and Sophia Keshmiri fanned out across the state to capture the action.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)More than 3,000 people gathered in downtown Sioux Falls on Saturday for the latest No Kings protest – making it the city’s largest protest so far this year, according to organizer crowd estimates.
The protest was the 13th in South Dakota for the day, organizer Craig Brown said. Protesters gathered to listen to speakers, display homemade signs and chant “this is what democracy looks like” and “we love America; that’s why we’re here,” and call for President Donald Trump “to go.”
Brown said the turnout is a testament to the movement’s momentum and people’s anger at the Trump administration.
“There’s a sense of commitment in this crowd that we haven’t felt before,” Brown said.

More than 2,600 No Kings rallies with millions in attendance took place across the country on Saturday. The second No Kings day, following the first in June, is in response to what a broad coalition of liberal advocacy and labor organizations say is “the increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration, which they have doubled down on since June.”
Lexi Pratt, of Sioux Falls, brought her daughter to the No Kings protest in Sioux Falls, saying that she “could not, in good conscience, be a good parent” without standing up when she sees something wrong. She’s concerned about women’s health care and the Trump administration’s “attack on our public education.”
“The Trump administration is violating all the checks and balances that our country was founded on to ensure that we all have the same rights,” Pratt said.
Jody Fleischhacker, of Sioux Falls, wore a frog hat — a symbol of resistance after a Portland protester wearing an inflatable frog costume was sprayed with chemicals through his costume’s air vent by a federal agent earlier this month.
Fleischhacker, who is an Air Force veteran, said she attended both No Kings protests in Sioux Falls this year because she believes Trump is unsuitable for office and should be removed.
“He’s made changes that are hurting his own people,” Fleischhacker said. “He wants to build a big, beautiful ballroom and yet take away our health care and take away food benefits to people who need them.”
The turnout exceeded organizers’ expectations despite a police investigation into a suspicious vehicle that was viewed as a potential explosives threat at the site of the protest the night before. The area was shut down to the public between 8 p.m. and 3 a.m. before police determined there were no explosives in the area.
No Kings day brings millions into US streets in anti-Trump protests

A counter protest, dubbed the “Real American Rally,” was held during the same time a block away from the No Kings protest. It drew about 30 people.
John Small, an organizer of the counter protest, said the gathering was intended to be positive and show “love for the country we live in.”
“I understand there are people who don’t like our current president. I understand that they want their voices heard. That’s great. But I don’t know how this is going to help,” Small said, referring to the No Kings protest. “Do they think there is going to be something to come from this?”
Brown said he sees the No Kings movement continuing up until the 2026 elections. That could impact midterm elections and turnout to create “real, sustained pushback against this regime.”
But the real impact of Saturday’s protest is a continued effort to build community, Brown added.
“Maybe I look across the crowd and I see my neighbor who I had no idea they feel like I do. Maybe I go and talk to them and we connect. We decide to go to a city council or county commission meeting we’re concerned about together,” Brown said. “Those are touch points that we’re seeing in real time. This is working.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/591A2067-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-18 21:01:20.554073

See Colorado Newsline’s live coverage of No Kings protests here.


An overflow crowd spilled into Civic Center Park, and multiple streets surrounding the Capitol grounds were shut down as the event began just after noon. Near the state Capitol steps, attendees heard from a lineup of speakers including former state Rep. Joe Salazar, who told the crowd in a fiery speech that Trump’s agenda “threatens to tear the fabric of this country apart.”
“There is no king in America, and we will not be silenced by authoritarians,” Salazar said to cheers. “We will not be painted as domestic terrorists. We are just Coloradans, just Americans, who are calling a spade a spade and a dictator a dictator — because that is our constitutional right to do so.”
Tiffany Weber, founder of the activist group Solidarity Warriors and one of the Denver protest’s organizers, blasted U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson’s characterization of the nationwide No Kings event this week as a “Hate America” rally.
“He has the gall to say we hate America. We love America,” Weber told the crowd. “We love the loud, beautiful, chaotic streets of Denver. We love the variety of ways that people show up to protests, and we hate the fact that not everyone can safely exercise their American right to free speech.”

Organizers of the Denver protest estimate that more than 25,000 demonstrators were in attendance, Salazar told Newsline. An estimated 12,000 to 15,000 demonstrators gathered in Colorado Springs. The nationwide No Kings Coalition, partners of which include liberal and progressive groups like Indivisible, MoveOn and the ACLU, estimated 7 million people turned out Saturday to demonstrate against what it called Trump’s “authoritarian actions and power grabs.”
The latest round of protests come as Trump has ordered the deployment of National Guard troops to support Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in the cities of Chicago and Portland, which he has falsely described as “war ravaged” in spite of recent nonviolent anti-ICE protests that have prominently featured inflatable animal costumes and naked bicycle rides.










I’m hoping to save democracy. We need to defeat these people trying to tear us down and destroy our Constitution.


– Jerry Hawthorne of Fruita, at the No Kings demonstration in Grand Junction


Throughout the day, the atmosphere at Saturday’s demonstration in Denver was similarly peaceful and festive, featuring countless satirical anti-Trump protest signs — “The Only Thing Colorado Likes More Than Hiking on a Saturday Is Our Democratic Rights,” read one — and dozens of protesters clad in inflatable costumes of the kind recently popularized by protesters in Portland.
Gerry Lauer, a demonstrator dressed in an inflatable chicken costume, said he had been inspired by footage of the Portland protests and ordered the costume online before Saturday’s event.
“Portland did a great job of finding a way to eliminate the hostility, (and) kind of create that safe place to be,” Lauer said. “It’s a real serious time, but we don’t need to be creating violence and hostility. We need to figure out how to get it around that.”

‘This insanity has to stop’
Coloradans also turned out for a No Kings protest in Grand Junction, where an organizer with Indivisible said thousands had turned out in the Western Slope city to protest the Trump administration.
One of those participants was Jerry Hawthorne of Fruita.
“I’m hoping to save democracy. We need to defeat these people trying to tear us down and destroy our Constitution,” he said.

“This insanity has to stop. It’s out of control,” she said.
Rick Griffith, Bev Griffith, Bill Shelton and Connie Ellenberger displayed protest signs designed by Shelton. Bev Griffith said the Grand Junction event was their first No Kings rally and that they participated because President Donald Trump is “running our country into the ground” and “he should be behind bars.”

Tensions over immigration enforcement
In his second term, Trump has pledged to carry out the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” aiming to remove all of the estimated 12 million immigrants in the country without permanent legal status, regardless of how long they have been in the country, the legal status of their family members or whether they have criminal records.
Tensions have risen in cities like Chicago, Portland and Los Angeles as ICE enforcement operations have become more expansive and aggressive, drawing protests that Trump administration officials have in turn harshly criticized and sought to meet with further crackdowns by federal law enforcement, as well as troop deployments. Trump told an audience of top U.S. military leaders last month that American cities should be used as “training grounds for our military,” and he has repeatedly spoken of invoking the Insurrection Act to broaden his authority to deploy the military against U.S. citizens.

Trump’s mass deportation program has been bolstered by $45 billion in new ICE funding in the Republican federal spending and tax cut law approved in July. At least 170 people with U.S. citizenship have been swept up in the agency’s expanded enforcement operations so far this year, ProPublica reported Thursday.
“We can’t treat people like this. We can’t treat anybody like this, let alone immigrants who are minding their own business and doing their work,” said Emily Magner, an Aurora resident who attended Saturday’s protest at the Capitol. “(They say) ‘We’re only after the bad ones.’ Well, then why are you going to meatpacking plants (and) places where you think immigrants would work?”

After hearing from rally speakers, thousands of demonstrators marched away from the Capitol down 15th Street into Denver’s Central Business District. Before the march, Julian Camera of the American Civil Liberties Union spoke to the crowd about their constitutional rights, including the right to free speech and the right to remain silent if detained by law enforcement.
“The reason I share these rights with you today is because it’s rookie hour at the federal government, and if you’re detained by law enforcement, they might try to intimidate you and lie to you about your rights,” Camera said. “We’re not going to let them get away with trying to rewrite the Constitution just because Trump is telling them to.”
Following the march, most demonstrators left the Capitol area by 4 p.m. A much smaller group of protesters later marched to 20th and Chestnut streets, where Denver Police Department officers “dispersed the group to deny access to the highway” and made multiple arrests, according to a DPD social media post.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Thousands of people gathered at 10 events across Louisiana as part of Saturday’s national No Kings movement to protest President Donald Trump. Beyond their criticisms of the administration, organizers and participants shared messages of unity and countered Republicans who labeled their events as “hate rallies.” 
Helping set that lighter tone were several rally participants in costumes. Some were getting a jump start on Halloween while others said they took their inspiration from protestors in Portland, Oregon, who’ve demonstrated while in disguise against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions in their city. 
In New Orleans, where little excuse is needed for costuming, thousands showed up for a concert and rally along the Lafitte Parkway. The city hosted a parade through the Marigny neighborhood during the first No Kings day in June.  
Among the participants was Elaine Ravich, 96, who held a sign identifying her as part of the Greatest Generation and an opponent of tyranny.
“We fought in the 1940s, and there are not too many of my generation alive,” Ravich said. “I am representing every single one of them that was here, and we were fighting again for our children, grandchildren and generations to come, and we will not allow this to happen.”

Hundreds took part in the No Kings event at Zemurray Park in Hammond, which featured equal parts protest, parody and picnic. 
Participant Katie Greer of Slidell was part of the crowd, wearing a cap to honor her Navy veteran husband, Paul, who died in August. He would have been alongside her at the protest had he not succumbed to Alzheimer’s disease, she said.
Greer noticed that a sizable portion of the crowd were, like her, senior citizens. She recounted her involvement in comparable protests against the Vietnam War in the 1970s.
“We did this once. We’re back to do it again,” Greer said.
On the other end of the age spectrum were the two school-aged children of Daisy and Michael Daigle, also from Slidell. The couple said it was important for them to take part in Saturday’s event as a family to show their son and daughter they don’t agree with the direction of the nation under Trump’s leadership.

Speakers at the Hammond event urged those in attendance to stay active and connected, even though they are greatly outnumbered by Republicans in the Northshore region. The parishes in the area are split between the congressional districts of U.S. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Julia Letlow, R-Start.      
Daisy Daigle said the rally provided some encouragement to those who might feel their voices aren’t heard.   
“To be able to come here to see this and have a community and see it is really good, right? Because not everybody can make it to meetings,” she said. “We’re all struggling day to day just to get by. So to have this one day to be able to come out is really important. 
More than 150 people assembled at the edge of Lock Park in downtown Lake Charles for its No Kings event, while a small group of counter-protestors stood across a quiet side street.
Matthew Desormeaux was among the rally participants, holding a sign that read: “Abolish ICE is now the moderate position.” He said he considers immigration an important issue on both a national and state level. 
“This is home. I was born and raised here,” Desormeaux said. “Lake Charles is a conservative area, but we’ve got to let [undocumented] people know that they’re not alone.”

Louisiana has nine ICE detention and staging facilities and is second only to Texas, with 23 ICE detention centers, with nearly 7,500 people in custody according to immigrant rights advocacy groups. Gov. Jeff Landry declared an emergency to expedite the refurbishment of a maximum security section of Louisiana State Penitentiary so it could also house ICE detainees.
“Immigrants are members of our community and should have the right to live and work where they want because they contribute,” Desormeaux added.
Sam McNabb stood with seven other men across the street from the No Kings assembly, flanked by two flags – one U.S. flag in black and another that read “MAGA Trump 45 47.”
“Trump’s not a king. If he were, they’d be in jail, all these cuckoos,” McNabb said, gesturing toward the No Kings rally across the street. 
McNabb said the other men with him were on their lunch break, and that the No Kings rally participants must not have jobs. 
One of the counter-protesters crossed the street to wave a flag in front of the crowd that read “Don’t tread on Trump.” A small rope barricade separated him from No Kings protestors. On his second pass down the block, local No Kings organizer Carolyn Woosley escorted the man..
“He just took my arm and said let’s go,” Woosley told the Illuminator.

Other No Kings events in Louisiana took place in Baton Rouge, Shreveport, Monroe, Ruston, Alexandria and Lafayette. 
In addition, Bradley Hesson, a 15-year-old Leesville High School student, organized what he described as a peaceful protest outside City Hall against Trump, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson “and more of our leaders who don’t want to take accountability,” he said.
Greg LaRose in Hammond, Natalie McLendon in Lake Charles and Jason Kerzinski in New Orleans contributed to this report.

Organizers of the “No Kings” rally called it a “movement for our collective liberation.” 
Republicans have referred to the series of rallies as “Hate America Day,” although presence from opposition leaders at the event itself was minimal. 
“We are living almost in a police state now where people are being disappeared, taken away with men and women in military gear wearing masks,” said Lisa Mahoney of Beverley, Mass. “I was a human rights activist with Amnesty International for 15 years. I worked for people in many other countries that were in this sort of situation. I never thought I’d see it happen here.” 
The “No Kings” rally in Boston was one of dozens taking place across the state and one of more than 2,000 taking place across the country. The demonstrations were organized by a consortium including several unions, faith leaders, activists, and the American Civil Liberties Union to push back against the Trump administration as it uses federal power to indict critics, deploy troops to Democratic-run cities, and strip funding from universities with policies aimed at fostering diversity. 
Several Massachusetts politicians, including Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, and Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, made appearances. Protestors brought thousands of signs, deriding the president and his cabinet for policies related to their use of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the cutting of scientific research at the federal level, and attacks on freedom of speech. 
Unlike similar protests that have occurred across the country in recent months, there was minimal conflict during the event. There was no major effort to organize counter-protestors, and Boston Police officers remained largely disengaged with the crowd, mostly sticking to their posts near the entrances to the Common. According to the department, no arrests were made in association with the event. 
The mass deportations by ICE and the deployment of the national guard into US cities under the second Trump administration was a major theme of many of the speeches at the event.  
“It’s no surprise that the White House wants to attack us. To seize more power, they need people to believe that this country and our cities are in a state of disaster,” said Wu. “Day after day, this president and his corrupt cabinet mistake cruelty for greatness, and payoffs for power.” 
She also invoked Boston’s historical role in overthrowing autocrats.  
“For the last 250 years and counting in Boston, every day is ‘No Kings day,’” she added 
Wu powered through her speech despite some chants from protestors, calling her a “liar” and “for hire.” Rahsaan Hall, president of the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts and emcee for the day’s main stage events, addressed the jeers following her remarks. 
“This is what democracy looks like. It’s not nice and neat, it’s not clean and squeaky. It’s messy. It’s disruptive. It’s uncomfortable,” Hall said. “If we can’t tolerate disruption within the midst of our own disruptive protest, we’re doing it wrong.” 
The response from Republicans across the state was somewhat muted. Mike Kennealy, who is running in the GOP primary for next year’s governor’s race, criticized Gov. Maura Healey’s job performance thus far. “As citizens around Massachusetts are protesting on ‘No Kings Day’, consider this,” he posted to X, “There’s a politician who stood by while migrant children were raped and abused in government-run facilities. A politician who stood by while unemployment rose by 23%, and did nothing.” 
In an interview set to air on Fox News on Sunday, Trump downplayed the rallies. “They’re referring to me as a king,” Trump said. “I’m not a king.” 
Many protestors disagreed, likening the President to an autocrat. 
“I came out here because of the way the Trump administration is oppressing our free speech,” said Boston resident Mary Buonanno. “I felt it was important that they knew, and that we stood strong against having a dictator in the White House.”  
Protestors also called for unity against what they viewed as a growing threat. 
“I’m independent, neither Republican or Democrat,” said Boston resident Paul Finnegan. He said he attended the rally because the lies told by Trump had “just gone too far.” 
“The joke was that he could go to Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and still get elected, but now he’s got a whole chorus of people who are just tearing up the Constitution. That’s enough.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-18-at-7.53.35-PM.png?fit=1024%2C770&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-18 21:01:20.554073

The event came four months after an innocent bystander, Afa Ah Loo, was shot and killed in Salt Lake City at a No Kings protest planned by a different group.
This time, organizers worried that memories of the tragedy and violence in June were still too fresh and many would still feel too afraid to attend, said Jamie Carter, a volunteer with Salt Lake Indivisible who planned Saturday’s rally.
But afterward, Carter said she hoped the event – fairly relaxed and punctuated by boisterous moments – restored a sense of safety and solidarity for anyone who felt uneasy. 
“It felt like our goals were met, both helping to heal the community, and providing a place for people to express their anger, but to leave with joy,” Carter said. 
Haylee Bowcut, 25, said she had some anxiety about the protest because of the June shooting, but decided Saturday morning to attend and bring a sign saying, “Hate never made a country great.” 
“It just felt like the right thing, to go today,” said Bowcut, of Pleasant View.
Many outside the Capitol chanted, “We are the patriots!,” wore costumes and came with friends or family, listening intently to speakers, a comedian and musical performances during the roughly two-hour event. 
“We’re going to hold every government official accountable, from the highest levels of power, including every ICE agent,” Carter said from a podium on the Capitol steps, to thunderous applause. 
She and other speakers said they want to see compassion inform new immigration laws, along with an end to the nation’s health care “crisis” and stricter gun laws to help protect children. 
Jeanetta Williams, president of the NAACP’s Salt Lake branch, condemned Trump’s appointment of “anti-civil rights extremists” in roles enforcing the nation’s civil rights laws.






























Many seemed to take inspiration from protesters in Portland, dressing in towering inflatable costumes depicting dinosaurs, axolotls, chickens, and a bumble bee, in a nod to Utah’s moniker, the Beehive State. 
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson last week described No Kings as “pro-Hamas,” and a “Hate American rally.” 
Speaking through a small window in her inflatable unicorn costume, Barbara Scott of Bluffdale rejected that. 
“I’m not paid to be here, I’m not AI, and I’m not a terrorist,” Scott said, showing off signs she made featuring the same messages. 
Scott also reflected on the violence that’s happened at demonstrations and political events like June’s protest and Charlie Kirk’s killing at the campus of Utah Valley University. 
As for her concern about her own safety while protesting, she said, “I have more concern about what’s going to happen to our country if we don’t get it back. At least if we die here, we die trying.” 
Organizers originally planned to follow the Capitol rally with a march to the Salt Lake City and County building, but canceled the march Tuesday when online RSVPs flooded in faster than they’d expected. They worried the crowd size for a march was too big for the few dozen unarmed safety volunteers they trained, Carter said. 
On Saturday, Utah’s Department of Public Safety estimated attendance at 3,500, while Carter said she believed it was much higher, near 10,000. 
Former state Sen. Steve Urquhart, who served in the Utah Legislature as a Republican from 2001-2016, was also in the crowd. He recalled believing years ago that any forces seeking to undercut democracy would come from the political left, but said he now feels differently. 
“Guess I was wrong about that one,” Urquhart said. He added that concerns about safety were on his mind before the rally. 
“Should we go, should we mask up? What should we do?” Urquhart recalled thinking. “When the administration is actively saying it’s targeting its opponents, that’s frightening.” 
Few counterprotesters came to the event. When a group of about three men, one wearing a ‘Trump 2024’ hat arrived at the Capitol lawn and started speaking through a megaphone, dozens in the No Kings group surrounded them, chanting, “No Nazis, no KKK, no fascist USA.”

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderThousands of people gathered Saturday in Atlanta as part of the No Kings rallies taking place nationwide, where speakers sounded the alarm against the potential for authoritarian rule under the Trump administration.
Speakers, which included prominent Georgia political figures and leaders of civil rights and advocacy organizations, described the current climate as a move away from democracy. It was a noticeable shift in tone from the No Kings events in June, when organizers warned of some of the administration’s undemocratic behaviors, such as hosting a military parade coinciding with President Donald Trump’s birthday. 
Former Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams framed the political battle as a fight over the nation’s direction.
“It used to be that we were all headed to the same destination. We just had different routes,” Abrams said to the crowd. “We may have a different way to get there, but the route we were going to take was democracy … but on the other side, they decided that the route they wanted to take was not democracy, but authoritarianism.”

Organizers say more than 10,000 people turned out Saturday at the Atlanta Civic Center, one of over 40 events held across Georgia, before marching to the state Capitol, but the actual number could be closer to 12,000, said Laura Judge with Indivisible North Metro, which is one of the event’s organizers. Martha Shockey, a convener of the Indivisible Georgia Coalition, said more than 5,000 people registered ahead of the protest. 
Andrea Young, executive director of the ACLU of Georgia, told the crowd that the Trump administration has created a two-tiered system of justice where some are “above the law” and others are below.
“We love America too much to give it over to a wannabe king,” Young said. “The Trump regime puts billionaires above the law … at the same time, the Trump regime acts like some of us are below the law.”
In an interview Friday ahead of the rally, Young cited several examples of the current administration’s alleged abuses. She pointed to the administration’s actions on immigrant rights, including the denial of due process for people suspected of living in the country unlawfully and the attempt to abolish the 14th Amendment’s citizenship provision by executive order — a move the ACLU is challenging. She also raised concerns over the deployment of military personnel in American cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, as well as the “dismantling” of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and what she called the undermining of “facts and science.”

Abby Tighe, a founding member of Fired but Fighting, a coalition of terminated CDC employees and public health allies, described the latest mass terminations at the agency as “another deliberate attempt to traumatize federal workers and attack the American public.” The CDC workforce has shrunk by about 3,000 this year, with the latest round of layoffs in October affecting about 600 workers.
“Donald Trump continued to spread lies about vaccines, medications, and research. Their lies about vaccines have led to mistrust and violence. Their dehumanization and vitriol is directly responsible for the August attack on CDC that claimed the life of DeKalb County’s officer (David) Rose, while my friends and own child cowered in fear,” Tighe said.
Sen. Raphael Warnock speaks at the No Kings demonstrations in Atlanta on Oct. 18, 2025. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
Georgia U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock urged the audience to stand up for democracy and fight for their rights. Warnock pointed to the importance of unity and cooperation, regardless of political affiliation, and called for the end of the government shutdown and the extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies.
“We don’t have to do one or the other. We can do both at the same time,” he said.
He also warned against the dangers of fascism and the need to fight for the rights of all people, including Palestinians, Israelis, Ukrainian children and American citizens.
“You cannot outsource democracy to anybody. You cannot outsource citizenship. It is all of us. That’s why they’re trying to divide us, because when all of us stand together and raise our voices, we win,” he said.
James Salter said he showed up at the No Kings demonstrations in Atlanta on Oct. 18, 2025 to fight fascism because he worries that ignoring the Constitution will lead to a dictatorship run by the rich. Alander Rocha/Georgia Recorder
James Salter said he participated in the rally because he’s “trying to rebuff fascism while we still care,” saying he’s concerned about law and order under Trump.
“If the Constitution is no longer understood and taken seriously, then we slip into a fascist dictatorship that is ruled by the ultra rich. And we lose,” he said.
James Threatt, who also attended the rally in Atlanta, said that the name of the No Kings march spoke for itself.
“This man is setting himself up as the king, and he’s not,” he said. “This is America.”

Threatt also said he was concerned about how the Trump administration was treating immigrants, saying the mass arrests were violating people’s civil rights, which he compared to the struggle for Black civil rights.
“They’re taking civil rights away from people, period,” he said. “Not only Black people but everybody else.”
Lloyd Norman said he hoped to be a “small voice” to help hold power to account.
“Hitler had something called the Big Lie theory, that if I say it long enough and loud enough, people will say it for me,” Norman said. “That’s why I’m here, because we have to say ‘you’re lying.'”
Speakers also called for ongoing, non-violent action and engagement in local elections. U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson of Lithonia urged the crowd to embody Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s vision of the “beloved community,” which King used to describe a society that is free from discrimination and poverty and is based on peace, justice and equality.
“We, the people, are the ones to create the beloved community, and we do it through love, passion, non-violence,” Johnson said before the crowd marched to the Capitol.

Amanda Solberg-Bowen, who lives near Watkinsville, showed up Saturday in a newly acquired inflatable frog costume. She was one of many people who showed up at a No Kings rally Saturday dressed up in inflatable costumes as a nod to the so-called “Portland Freedom Frog.” Earlier this month, a federal agent in Portland shot pepper spray inside of a protester’s inflatable frog costume while demonstrating outside of an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility.
“Somebody said a minute ago that it’s a great way to be present but also be obviously nonviolent – a disarming sort of presence,” Solberg-Bowen said of her costume, adding that being there Saturday felt like “the least that we can do.”
Taffy Jo Mayers said her sense of patriotism is what brought her to the rally. She also expressed concerns about how the government is treating immigrants.
“I’ve been an immigrant,” she said. “I’ve lived and worked in foreign countries, and the way that America is treating the people that are coming here is abhorrent. It’s inhumane.”
This was Julie Runk’s second No Kings rally. As she waited for marchers to reach the state Capitol, the Atlanta resident waved to passing cars and held a sign that said “Stop pretending your racism is patriotism. Oh, and release the Epstein files.”

“People ask me, ‘Why are you doing it? It’s not going to change anything,'” Runk said. “I’m just unhappy with what’s happening and I want to do whatever I can. This is a small bit.”
Runk said she relishes the sense of community she finds at the No Kings events, but she also said she believes that speaking out helps to empower others to do the same.
“I also know that this administration doesn’t like to look bad and this makes them look bad,” Runk said of the No Kings rallies. “And when ICE is fighting with people in inflatable frog suits, it makes them look like idiots, and they don’t like to be embarrassed. So, this to me is a good way to get under their skin if nothing else,” she said.

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)In Queen Anne’s County, where 62% of voters went for President Donald Trump in last year’s election, some of the people who showed up for the No Kings rally said they were pleasantly surprised by Saturday’s turnout.
Several hundred people turned up, many waving hand-drawn signs by the roadside in Centreville’s small historic downtown, while others gathered in the courtyard, where a musician performed at a piano, and organizers opened the mic for testimonials.
“The honks and waves way outnumber the middle fingers,” said Tom Gallagher, 74, of the public response to No Kings in Centreville. The Anne Arundel County resident crossed the Bay Bridge to attend the rally here.
Back across the Bay in Baltimore — where 12.8% of voters backed Trump in 2024 — the challenge was not getting people to turn out, but managing No Kings on the same day as the 25th annual Baltimore Running Festival, when an estimated 10,000 runners were expected to take over downtown to compete in everytingn from a 5K to a full marathon.
Most coped by combining the two events, with runners wearing No Kings gear and No Kings attendees lining the race route with signs playing off the combination of the two events, like the one that said, “You’re running better than the government.”
Jackie Bustos took advantage of the scheduling of the events to accomplish personal goal of completing a half marathon while also protesting Trump policies on immigration and other issues.
“I felt supported,” said Bustos, who ran with a No Kings sign on her back. “Throughout the city, there were tons of signs that were supporting the cause. So I was running, but there were also people saying ‘no fascism, no kings.’”

The Baltimore and Centreville rallies were just two of more than 60 events scheduled in Maryland Saturday, from Ocean City to LaVale and from Northeast to Lexington Park and scores of points in between.
They were in big cities like Baltimore and small towns like Centreville. They were in deep blue counties like Montgomery, which had more than a dozen events scheduled, to deep red counties like Carroll, where one event was scheduled for the County Government Building in Westminster for those willing to brave it.
Nationwide, more than 2,700 events were planned, in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Guam and the District of Columbia, where as many as 100,000 were expected to turn out. Events were being held overseas as well, in Australia and across Europe – although events in the United Kingdom were tactfully labeled “No Tyrants” events.
Some estimates said turnout for the weekend’s events could be in the millions.
The latest rallies are a followup to No Kings events in June that were held to counter President Donald Trump’s massive military parade in Washington to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Army – and, some say not coincidentally, Trump’s 79th birthday.
There were about 2,000 events in June. Organizers said they scheduled this weekend’s events because Trump “has doubled down” since the first rallies, ramping up immigration raids and deploying troops to Democratic cities and urging the Justice Department to prosecute his enemies.
A main theme of the events, besides no kings, is peaceful protest. Rallygoers are told to leave weapons at home and are trained in de-escalation techniques. And in Maryland, at least, it seemed to be working, only minimal conflicts reported.
‘What was your tipping point?’
Standing in the courtyard in front of the Queen Anne’s County historic courthouse in Centreville, a bulletin board asked locals: “What was your tipping point?”
No more context was needed.
“The day he was elected — the first time,” read one sticky note. “Musk + DOGE,” read another. “The Apprentice,” one attendee wrote.

“We wanted to know, what was that moment that you felt like you needed to come?” said Elaine McNeil, chair of the Queen Anne’s Democratic Central Committee, which organized Saturday’s event. “Because that’s the feedback that we need to get other people to that tipping point to start standing up.”
Gallagher, the Anne Arundel County resident who traveled to Centreville for the rally, said he has been disturbed by the administration’s decision to attack ships off the coast of Venezuela, killing several people.
“Even if he’s correct that they’re drug dealers, that’s still a legal matter, not a military matter,” said Gallagher, a retired Navy veteran. “You’re being judge, jury and executioner for people out on boats in the water. It’s beyond the pale.”
No Kings protests dotted Maryland’s rural and conservative Eastern Shore, running up U.S. Route 50 from Ocean City and Salisbury to Cambridge and Easton, where protesters lined the busy highway beside a Wawa convenience store, attracting a smattering of honks as cars drove past. A single counter-protester stood in the grass behind them, yelling “We love President Trump.” But he was handily outnumbered, as the assembled group chanted: ““Love, not hate, makes America great.”
Beverly Fox, 75, an Easton resident who is disabled, uses a motorized wheelchair to get around. On Saturday, the back of her wheelchairt sported an image of Trump wearing a crown with the message “No Kings.”
“That man has got to go,” said Fox, who worries about Trump’s attacks on health insurance for vulnerable Americans. “Every day I think I can’t get shocked any more.”
In Easton’s Talbot County, Trump’s victory was far narrower than elsewhere on the Eastern Shore, winning 11,125 votes to 11,119 for Vice President Kamala Harris.
For many attendees on Saturday, it felt difficult to choose just one reason they were drawn to decorate handmade signs and wave them by the roadside.

“I don’t even know where to start,” said Ashley Cromwell, a Queenstown resident who came to Centreville with a “We the People” sign.
“Since Trump first — in 2015 — came on the scene this way, I’ve been against what he stands for, and the hatred and the anger and the division and the way that he wants to take power for himself,” Cromwell said.
Even if it was sometimes hard to articulate, attendees on Saturday were united by a passion to speak up against Trump.
Diana Leonard, a Queen Anne’s resident, said she began attending anti-Trump protests for the first time in March.
“I’m out here for the people that can’t be out here,” said Diana Leonard, a Queen Anne’s resident. “Because there are people that are either disabled or they’re afraid, or they’ve been fighting forever.”
But, like many at the rallies, she was keeping it light. Leonard wore an inflatable otter costume Saturday and carried a sign that said, “You otter join us!” adding that she was gunning for a “positive, unifying” message.
‘Run like Trump’s behind you’
Positive energy was very much the mood in Baltimore, where the marathon route was lined with people who alternated between those holding anti-Trump protest signs or posterboards offering encouragement from enthusiastic friends and families. Or both.
“That’s one of the things I love about Baltimore,” Bustos said. “It’s really nice to be in Baltimore and see that there’s this energy for the runners and also supporting a very big political cause.”
Brenden Caffey, 30, said that he and his wife had been in other running festivals before, but having a message this time brought a new energy to the challenge. He painted his shirt Friday night with “NO KINGS” in preparation for the run.

“It was nice … I think it was kind of cool that it was able to be combined a little bit,” Caffey said.
Protesters on the sides of the tracks shouted words of encouragement while their signs disparaged the Trump administration.  People like Lior Levy, 28, who stood on the sidelines with a sign declaring “Baltimore says ‘No Kings.’” She said that merging the rally with the marathon provided “a lot of visibility” for the political demonstration.
“Us being here for the runners, it drives them. And them having the signs rallies us — and it’s a good back and forth,” Levy said.
Chris Ryder, 65, a former U.S. Agency for International Development employee who retired during the first Trump administration, said  the recent federal layoffs are just one of the many reasons to come out to the marathon and protest along the track.
“We came out because we think we all need to raise our voices against so much of what’s going on with this administration,” he said.
Laurie Rome, 63, said that while the Baltimore No Kings rally was a little more spread out than other protests, it was still important to show up, “no matter the format.”
“It’s kind of nice to have it sort of pervasive along the route. Not just people clustered in one place,” she said. “There are people everywhere who think that the current level of unkindness, instability and hatred is not okay.”
Protesters lining the roads — and the marathon routes — seemed to be popular venues. In Prince George’s County, sporadic clumps of protesters lined U.S. Route 1 from the Washington, D.C., line to the University of Maryland, College Park, and beyond.
On the Eastern Shore, Denise Perdue of Graysonville stood on the side of the road and talked about her “tipping point” while waving a sign. For Perdue, it was Nov. 5, 2024, when Trump was elected a second time.

“I didn’t think that there was so much hate in the United States as there is, and so much bigotry,” she said, adding that she felt that the electorate scorned Harris, the Democratic nominee, because she is a woman of color.
As Perdue held a sign inviting passersby to “Honk for Humanity,” one driver in a pickup truck flew past: “Sore losers!” he yelled.
Perdue was quick to respond: “Jesus loves you!” she shouted back. It was the same response she’d used all day for the occasional heckler passing through.
“Because, what are you going to say to that?” she joked.

In Lexington, Gracia O’Brien, 71, said “when folks in Congress said this was going to be a ‘hate America’ rally, I said ‘no, I love America.’ I want my grandchildren to know I stood up. I’m old, and I’ve never been scared for our democracy. I am now.” 
Marsha Bezold of Midway hoisted a sign showing a U.S. flag and the words “Pro-America. Anti-Trump.” She cited multiple reasons for protesting, from “the dismantling of our Constitution” to coming cuts in health care that she said will hurt her family.  She said she thinks Trump’s goal is to intimidate Americans into keeping silent about his unprecedented power grabs. This is not the country I grew up in. I think Ronald Reagan would be rolling over in his grave to see this.”
In Louisville, former Democratic U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth greeted a large crowd gathered on the Belvedere:  “Hello all my fellow terrorists. Apparently that’s who the Republicans and the administration think we are: terrorists, antifa, violent criminals.” 
Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer recently said Democrats would “rather cater to the pro-terrorist wing of their party than to reopen the government.” House Speaker Mike Johnson described “No Kings” as a “hate America” rally
Yarmuth added that he thought the gathered crowd should show their “antifa membership cards” to Trump.
Protesters also rallied in smaller Kentucky towns. In Pikeville, a small crowd gathered, holding signs that said, among other things, “Hillbillies against Facism,” Mountain Top News reported. The Owensboro Times reported more than 500 people attended a downtown rally in the Daviess County seat. “The scene remained peaceful throughout the event.”

In Morehead, organizers reported “over 300 people and two dinosaurs” gathered for the “No Kings” rally. Speakers in the Rowan County seat included two Democrats running for U.S. Congress: attorney Ned Pillersdorf, who is hoping to unseat longtime Republican incumbent Rep. Hal Rogers, and Logan Forsythe, who is running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell.

In Lexington, police blocked streets as thousands of protesters marched through downtown; observers said it was one of the largest demonstrations they had ever seen in Kentucky’s second-largest city.



































Capitol rally in Frankfort
While the state Capitol is closed amid a renovation project, protesters were able to peacefully gather on its steps. Similar demonstrations have been held at the site since Trump took office earlier this year for the second time. 
Dennis Van Horn, a Frankfort resident and veteran, listened to speakers on the Capitol lawn while holding a sign that said a chant the crowd used throughout the day: “No thrones, no crowns, no kings” — a chant that was heard throughout the day. He said Saturday’s crowd was twice the size of the first“No Kings” rally in June.
Van Horn said he wanted to attend Saturday’s protest “because (of) the anxiety from watching our president trash the Constitution, rule of law and take retribution on his enemies.” 
“And that’s not the way it’s supposed to be,” he added.

Woodford County resident Alyssa Cumming and her dog, Cody, came to the Capitol to stand for her friends and family who are immigrants but are afraid to make their voices heard at this time. Cumming and Cody attended protests earlier this year. 
She raised concerns about the direction of the country, adding that “we’re not moving any closer to greatness right now.” 
“I just feel like everybody can do something,” Cumming said. “I don’t have any political power other than my feet.”
Some politicians also joined the crowd. Speaking through a microphone, Democratic state Rep. Erika Hancock, of Frankfort, addressed the rally and was supportive of the group’s message. 
“This No Kings rally is about reminding everyone in power that they serve the people, not the other way around,” she says to cheers.
John “Drew” Williams, a Democratic candidate challenging Republican U.S. Rep. James Comer in Kentucky’s 1st Congressional District, said the Frankfort rally was his second of the day after another event in Danville. Williams, who is from far West Kentucky, said it was important for him to be in Frankfort because of the town’s importance to the state and because Franklin County was added to the 1st Congressional District during redistricting. In Comer’s district, a thin line of counties along Kentucky’s southern border connects the state’s far western tip and the Mississippi River with Franklin and Boyle counties in Central Kentucky.
“This is what democracy looks like,” Williams said. “This is what the conversation wants to be, not just right now when we feel like there is a set of government overreach, but every year and every day.”

In Louisville, thousands gathered at the Belvedere, a grassy event space next to the Muhammed Ali Center in downtown Louisville, hearing from a range of elected officials and advocates after marching and chanting through the city streets. 
Rebecca Elliott of Louisville watched marchers holding signs, including one that read: “Immigrant Rights Are Citizen’s Rights” — one of many signs that referenced the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics. 
“The right of due process applies to all of us. So, if we allow people to start taking that right away from our immigrant neighbors, then we’re also going to end up not having it in the long run, too,” Elliott said. “I think we have to defend the more vulnerable people so that we can maintain our own rights.” 
Other signs by protesters in Louisville referenced Trump’s executive orders, including one that designated antifa, a left-wing anti-facist political movement, as a domestic terrorist organization. Jamie and Brian Reichenbach came to the Louisville protest from Spencer County, holding a sign with the word antifa and an arrow pointing at themselves. 
Jamie Reichenbach said given that the country ought fascism in the past, she wanted to show that “we’re antifa.” 
“We stand for anti-fascism, which is what America was supposed to be,” Reichenbach said.
Brad Ector of Louisville, who sported an inflatable dragon costume that was buffeted by the wind as he marched, said he didn’t “want Portland to have all the fun.” 
“Just all the people in Portland that are there, pointing out the fact that they are not the terrorists that Trump wants us to believe,” Ector said. 
“As far as the dragon goes, someone needs to melt ice,” Ector said, apparently referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

More than 100 communities from southeast Michigan to the westernmost part of the U.P. joined in the show of might to advocate for civil rights, democracy and the rule of law. The protests were expected to attract millions of people nationwide to speak out against the Trump administration since he took office this year for a second term.
At Michigan’s Capitol building in Lansing, the show of resistance was palpable.
For over an hour before the official start to the event, people gathered on the Capitol lawn. Several demonstrators greeted their friends and family with hugs while taking pictures with rally signs. Over that hour, the size of the protest grew from a small crowd to a group that nearly reached the edges of the front lawn.

Like other protests against the administration documented earlier this month, many wore costumes, which ranged from various inflatable animal suits to robes from The Handmaid’s Tale. Security for the protest was pronounced, with several Michigan Department of State Police troopers in tactical gear and road patrol uniforms on the lookout for threats.
As the crowd grew, cars and trucks driving by honked in support throughout the event. Some waved flags, held up signs or played loud music, and most were met with cheers and applause from demonstrators along North Capitol Avenue.
Just before a series of speakers began, various songs of resistance played over the loud speakers, including “Holiday” by Green Day, which was met with cheers from the crowd. 
Several signs identified demonstrators as veterans, teachers and union members. Some protestors spoke of their concerns about Trump’s narratives on free speech, including his claim that he has ended free speech over flag burning, and some expressed worries about detentions and deportations by ICE. 
Others, especially older protestors, spoke about their fears for the future for younger generations – wanting their children and grandchildren to live in a country where they were free to protest. 
“We must commit ourselves, each and every one of you, all the way back to the streets to never, ever [give up],” Lansing-based community activist Lorenzo Lopez said in one of several addresses at the event. “We have to continue to resist, and we must never, ever let this country become a dictatorship.”
Speaking directly to the administration’s use of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to terrorize the immigrant community and enact its sweeping mass deportation policies, Lopez said it amounted to human trafficking.
“My fellow Americans, the mass deportations are not deportations at all,” he said. “When people are [detained] without due process, that’s called kidnapping. When they are sent to another country against their will, that’s human trafficking.”

Throughout the speeches, chants of “Release the files” and “Lock him up” permeated the crowd, especially in reference to Trump’s felony convictions in early 2024.
The rally started at 3 p.m. and was scheduled to run until 6 p.m. However, impending poor weather and gloomy skies ended the event early. As one organizer put it in a final speech, those who have been paying attention to the excesses of the Trump administration and its authoritarian tendencies have heard all the complaints before.
Now, however, was a time for action. As the crowd moved away from the Capitol lawn, thousands marched east down Michigan Avenue. They continued to chant, saying: “Donald Trump has got to go.” 
Cars and trucks driving through downtown Lansing continued to honk in support of the demonstrators who took to marching, a line of people that stretched across the bridge into the city’s Stadium District and beyond.
State Rep. Emily Dievendorf (D-Lansing) attended the rally in their district. They said it was a clear sign of solidarity and community building, and was bigger than the first No Kings rally held in June. With the Trump administration’s actions veering further into autocratic territory, the representative was also reflective on the moment, and the fight to retain the core tenets of the nation’s democratic values.

“If this isn’t a statement as to what we should do next, it is a statement that we have a community and we have resistance that is ready to push back,” Dievendorf said. “This rally was remarkable, in part, because the average person has reason to be afraid and to feel there might be consequences for dissenting right now. And yet we showed up anyway. I think that we’re starting to understand that silence is not going to get us out of this. The only way to fight fascism and to get our democracy back to a stable place is for us to have a united front in favor of rule of law and the Constitution.”
There were very few agitators or those launching counterprotests at the Lansing event, which ran counter to a warning from a GOP official who on Thursday claimed there would be problems from left-wing trouble makers at the event. At least one report of a counterprotester showed a peace keeping unit ushering him out of the crowd with little resistance otherwise.
On Thursday, Oakland County GOP Chair Vance Patrick warned in a bizarre statement issued in a vague email that left-wing agitators were planning to infiltrate and derail Saturday’s protests in Michigan. He specifically called out the Democratic Socialists of America.
The political party was indeed there at the Lansing rally, one of several political party vendors at the event, simply talking to voters about the issues of the day.

Among them was Sam Nelson, co-chair of the Greater Lansing DSA. Nelson said the event was certainly about mobilization, but it wasn’t a strike or a show of civil disobedience.
“It’s about putting out the calls. Everyone can come out and stand with hundreds of thousands, even millions, across the country,” Nelson said. “Yes, this is a rally, and rallies are about as peaceful as you can get when it comes to political demonstration.”
Instead of drumming chaos that didn’t exist, Nelson posited that the GOP in Michigan should look inward and denounce the young Republican group chats that were recently unveiled in news reports, which showed young party organizers shared slurs and violent political rhetoric.
“Then they can talk about peaceful discourse,” Nelson said.
Detroit, Flint, Ann Arbor and beyond
Rallies in other parts of the state also saw large crowds with thousands willing to exercise their rights to free speech while those rights still remain intact.
Among the larger No Kings rallies was at Roosevelt Park in southwest Detroit, where thousands of people of all ages and backgrounds began arriving just before 3 p.m., holding up signs in Spanish and English as they stepped out of their cars or buses, including “America has no kings,” or “No National Guard in Detroit.”
“The people united will never be defeated,” were one of the main chants heard around the crowd.

State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), who is running for the U.S. Senate next year, applauded the courage of the protesters and told the Advance she hoped that more protests like this one will continue
“It is encouraging, I know protesting might be intimidating, but it is a good way to stand up and fight back. We have an opportunity to stay together and raise our voices against Donald Trump and his administration.”
After rallying at the park, demonstrators then peacefully marched down Michigan Avenue, although there was at least one arrest when a counter-protestor and supporter of President Trump, Andre Williams, 24, was taken into custody by Detroit Police after he followed No Kings marchers and reportedly began to scuffle with demonstrators and force his way into the crowd before being handcuffed and placed in a squad car.

At the Ann Arbor demonstration earlier Saturday, resident Angela Williams, 91, sat among the several hundred demonstrators at Veterans Park and told the Advance that while she had lived through many turbulent times, this felt different.
“I have feared for our democracy before, but I’ve always felt that the three branches of government were independent. And now I’m very disturbed by the lack of independence,” Williams said.

In Flint, among the several thousand demonstrators who turned out to the city’s No Kings rally was former U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Flint), who told the Advance the crowd itself stood as a rejection of the characterization from Trump and his administration that participants were violent extremists.
“This is dissent. This is a group of people who are just everyday citizens. I’ve run into people that I went to elementary school with, not people that I’ve met along the path of political activism that has defined my work until now, but people that I haven’t seen for years, neighbors, old friends. These are citizens.”

And scattered among the crowds were volunteers with clipboards, collecting signatures for initiative petition campaigns hoping to make the 2026 ballot. 
“We are just out here trying to make sure that the people hold the power and not politicians,” said Drew Amidei, a staff organizer for Missouri Jobs with Justice Voter Action, at the Jefferson City rally. 
This was the second nationwide No Kings mass gathering, with the first organized in June to coincide with a military parade in Washington, D.C., that commemorated the 250th birthday of the U.S. Army and President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday.
Since then, Missourians have found more reasons to organize at the state level, said Sue Rodgers, spokesperson for We Stand United Missouri. The organization led the Jefferson City rally at the State Capitol, where hundreds of protesters turned out despite a rainy afternoon.
Sue Gibson, a volunteer with Respect Missouri Voters, collects signatures during the No Kings demonstration at the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City on Saturday. Respect Missouri Voters is the intiative petition campaign for a constitutional amendment that would make it harder for the General Assembly to overturn citizen-led ballot measures (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Rogers pointed to last month’s move by Missouri lawmakers to push forward a gerrymandered congressional map requested by Trump and a ballot measure to make it harder for citizens to amend the state’s constitution.
“There’s more specific issues at this point,” Rodgers told The Independent. “We see more evidence of the authoritarian power grabs and executive overreach.”
Even a thunderstorm in St. Louis wasn’t enough to dampen the spirits of protesters. 
“I know it’s raining. I know it’s a little cool,” former Democratic U.S. Rep. Cori Bush told a crowd of more than a thousand people gathered in downtown St. Louis amid the thunderstorm. “But you all, this is nothing in comparison to the reign that we’ll have to live through if we don’t resist the Donald Trump administration.”
 Jefferson City

Rodgers pointed to organizations with tents surrounding the Missouri State Capitol lawn with volunteers collecting signatures for three petition campaigns.
“We definitely have more of a focus this time on the initiative petitions and redistricting,” she said.
A petition seeking a statewide vote on the gerrymandered Missouri redistricting plan circulated during the demonstration, with groups like Missouri Jobs with Justice Voter Action and Respect Missouri Voters collecting signatures.
To them, the citizen-led petitions embody the spirit of No Kings — with voters asserting power and calling out leadership they believe is acting autocratic.

“No Kings is a good time to get this message out because both this referendum and this rally are really about empowering the people of Missouri,” Amidei said. “It’s really about asserting our democratic values.”
He told The Independent there was a “good amount of foot traffic” as he collected signatures for a petition seeking a statewide vote on the gerrymandered Missouri redistricting plan.
Organizers wanted voters’ rights to be emphasized while creating an uplifting environment.
“We encouraged them to come in costumes, have fun,” Rodgers said. “Everyone needs a little space to let off anxious energy and find out they are not alone.”
Rodgers was one of a handful of women dressed as suffragettes who spoke during the Jefferson City rally about women’s contributions to democracy.
Another speaker, assistant attorney general Greg Barnes, dressed as James Madison to warn demonstrators of threats to the U.S. Constitution. He spoke about Trump’s mentions of a third term.
But not every costume had an obvious nod to democracy. Others dressed as dinosaurs in inflatable costumes, and one organizer wore a Cheeto costume.
Respect Missouri Voters organizer Lindsay Browning, dressed in a cow onesie, told the crowd that the costumes are intentional.
“When we’re silly, we expose them as frauds,” she said. “Fascists can’t promote lies about dangerous, left-wing terrorists when we keep showing up unarmed wearing costumes.”
Respect Missouri Voters organizer Lindsay Browning leads chants during the No Kings rally in Jefferson City on Saturday. Browning said the organizers encouraged participants to wear costumes to show their intentions for a peaceful, uplifting event (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Unlike in June, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe did not declare a state of emergency ahead of Saturday’s rallies. At the time, Kehoe said his decision to activate the Missouri National Guard was a “precautionary measure” in the case of “events that are occurring or could occur.”
“We respect, and will defend, the right to peacefully protest,” Kehoe said in a statement at the time, “but we will not tolerate violence or lawlessness in our state.”
Kehoe is currently being sued by Lucas Cierpiot, a disability-rights activist from Blue Springs, and the son of a Republican state senator, over his decision to activate troops over the summer.
Local news outlets reported that the June protests remained uneventful between demonstrators and police.
 St. Louis 

The crowd at Keiner Plaza in downtown St. Louis brought with it ample American flags, ponchos and an occasional inflatable costume. 
“Fight looks like marching in the streets. Fight looks like collecting signatures,” state Rep. Ray Reed, a Democrat from St. Louis, told the crowd. “ … Fight looks like putting your name on a ballot.”
More than a thousand people gather in a thunderstorm on Saturday as part of a No Kings protest in downtown St. Louis (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
Brice Bloom-Ellis, 69, of St. Louis, stood several yards away holding a sign demanding the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. But ICE was front of mind. 
“I’m totally opposed to masked federal police snatching people off the street,” said Bloom-Ellis, who works in child welfare. “It’s just unbelievable that that’s happening in this country.” 
He was also appalled by Missouri’s new congressional map, which he called nothing but a “power grab.” 
Bloom-Ellis was far from the only one upset that the governor took the president’s request to redraw the congressional map in favor of Republicans to heart. 
Tullia Hamilton, 77, of St. Louis, said she’s never met Kehoe, but if she did, she knows what she would tell him: 
“I don’t know you, but chances are you’re three times the man Donald Trump is,” said Hamilton, a retired history professor. “Why are you bowing to him? He’s a small person.” 
More than a thousand people took to the streets on Saturday as part of a No Kings protest in downtown St. Louis (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
Beside Hamilton stood by her good friend, Dr. Seth Eisen, 84, the director of Washington University’s Clinical Rheumatology Research Program, who brought a sign that read: “hands off science.” 
“It’s really a throw-back for science and also for health care in St. Louis specifically, but in the state and in the nation as well,” said Hamilton, who in recent months has seen NIH funding decreased, studies halted, and colleagues leave academia for the pharmaceutical industry. 
“What’s happening now is going to impact research for 10 years,” he said. “Even if it were to change today.” 
Ryan Maliff, 35, of Webster Groves, who works in health care, is already seeing the impact on Missourians, including his patients who can no longer afford insulin. 
“A lot of what’s been done to gut the protections for Medicare and Medicaid, it’s affecting my work, it’s affecting my patients,” he said.

As the group rounded out its march through downtown, which lasted nearly two hours, Ari Jones-Bradley, 49, said she’s spent the past several months feeling hopeless, alone and terrified for the world her four sons are growing up in.
“We’re headed into extremely dark times, and this is not the country my grandfather fought for,” Jones-Bradley said of her grandfather who served in World War II at the Battle of Iwo Jima. 
But she said Saturday’s demonstration, which she called “electrifying,” shifted something in her. 
“I’m mad,” Jones-Bradley said. “I’m fully energized again and I’m ready to fight.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/101825_NoKings7-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-10-18 19:58:27.450897

(Photo by Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakotans who joined No Kings rallies in 11 cities Saturday pushed back on criticism that the events were anti-American.
“I love America, I love the Constitution, and I love what this country represents,” said Patrick McNally, 36, a dual citizen of Canada and the U.S. who joined a rally outside the North Dakota Capitol. 
Thousands protested Trump administration policies at rallies in Fargo and Bismarck with smaller events held in Grand Forks, Jamestown, Bottineau, Devils Lake, Dickinson, Williston, Minot and Medora. Some communities reported larger crowds than similar events in June, while others said windy weather deterred some participants.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson characterized the No Kings movement held in 2,600 cities as the “hate America rally.” Closer to home, North Dakota Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer called rally participants “left-wing nut jobs” in a statement last week.

Many North Dakotans who participated raised concerns about health care, including cuts to Medicaid and expiring subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, while others protested tariffs that are hurting farmers or advocated for protecting due process for immigrants.
“I’m very passionate about what’s happening in our country, so that is why I am protesting,” said Jessie Smette of Fargo, who joined a rally outside of City Hall. “Not because I have nothing better to do, and not because I’m getting paid to do it, but because I think it’s important work.” 
Trygve Hammer, a former Democratic-NPL Party U.S. House candidate, highlighted during a speech in Williston comments made by Republican lawmakers criticizing No Kings participants as far-left extremists who don’t value the foundational principles of the country.
“That is exactly wrong,” Hammer said in an interview after the event, which drew about 100 to Williston’s Harmon Park. “That’s exactly what we’re doing is standing up for those foundational truths.”

Bismarck rally participant Ann Mitchell, 57, is worried about the impacts of Trump administration tariffs and trade policies on her family’s farm near Pettibone, North Dakota. Mitchell said her husband’s family has farmed the land for generations, but now fears they could lose everything.
“We can’t sell our soybeans. We can’t sell our corn. Next year we don’t know what we’re gonna do,” Mitchell said. 
Beth Larson-Steckler, a 55-year-old Bismarck resident, said she has two chronically ill children who depend on Medicare for medication that can cost $1,000 a month. She wants the federal government to do more to protect health care and improve the existing system. 
“Congress needs to work together,” Larson-Steckler said. “They’re not working together. They’re pointing fingers. They’re wasting time. They’re not working for us.”
Across the street from the Bismarck protest, a handful of counter-protesters gathered at the North Dakota Republican Party headquarters with a sign stating “Jesus is Our King” and waving an American flag with Trump’s face on it.
Thousands joined the Fargo demonstration, including Clyde Hughes, a veteran who drove about 45 minutes from Wahpeton. He said the Republican Party is taking the country in the wrong direction. 
“We’re cutting social programs just to give billionaires tax cuts,” Hughes said.

He said he is grateful for the health care he gets through Veterans Affairs, though added, “You shouldn’t have to join the service to get decent health care,” he said.
Julie Brummund, an Air Force veteran from Fargo, said she is concerned about Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth eroding the freedom of the press. 
“I see American citizens justifying that and it just baffles my mind,” said Brummund, whose military service included an assignment in public affairs. 
Rick Loftus of Indivisible Fargo, who was volunteering to help with crowd control, said Fargo had a larger turnout than the No Kings rally in June. But he was also pleased to hear about strong turnouts around the state.
“It’s really these smaller places having events that’s inspiring to me,” Loftus said. 
A Grand Forks event attracted about 600 people, the largest protest since Trump was reelected, said organizer Julie Olson. She described the event as a “pro-America” rally, but said participants objected to Trump “acting with impunity.”
Nikki Tickerhoof, an organizer for the No Kings protest in Minot, said about 400 people attended the event that she said seemed like a block party with people handing out treats and wearing Halloween costumes.

About 150 people joined an event on Main Street in Valley City, with almost all of them emphasizing their love for America, said Vicki Voldal Rosenau, one of the organizers. Gail Pederson, a participant, said attendees also raised concerns about expiring subsidies for the Affordable Care Act and a lack of due process through immigration detentions.
“While that may not be a big thing in our neck of the woods, it certainly can affect us all,” Pederson said.
In Jamestown, organizers estimated about 250 people gathered near Mill Hill. Some who marched with signs had concerns about tariffs and the trade war, said Mike Weatherly, one of the organizers.
“Those things are hurting our farmers and they are finally starting to see it, which is terrible,” Weatherly said.
The demonstration remained peaceful, but one woman told participants to go back where they came from. 
“I’m right here. I’m right where I came from,” Weatherly said.
Approximately 100 people joined a No Kings protest in Devils Lake, organizers said, representing a broad cross section of the community. Veterans, farmers, teachers, clergy and others participated in the event that remained peaceful except for vociferous chants of “USA” that Nancy Lundon said rang out. 
“It wasn’t just Democrats,” Lundon said. “It was just people who are concerned about things as they are and what’s to come.”
About 25 people waved American flags during a rally in Bottineau, including some who traveled from Rolette and Westhope, said organizer Carol Wendel. 
“We’re here because we love America,” Wendel said. “And this is not the America we love.”

Eight residents of Medora decided to hold their own No Kings rally outside Theodore Roosevelt National Park rather than drive to an event in Dickinson. 
“We’re all so sad that our national parks are closed,” said Sandy Baertsch of Medora.
While the park remains open during the federal government shutdown, the visitor center is closed.
“We’ve seen lots of people come and are disappointed by the locked doors,” she said.
Baertsch said the group is calling on North Dakota’s congressional delegation to represent the state’s residents and farmers “instead of just doing whatever Trump asks, no matter what it is.”
Lucas Roy, 24, and Margaret Windingstad, 23, emphasized the need to protect public lands during the Bismarck event. 
“They’re not for sale. They shouldn’t be auctioned off for private uses,” Roy said.

Bob Ferguson addresses a No Kings rally in Everett on Oct. 18, 2025. (Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero for Washington State Standard)Gov. Bob Ferguson struck a defiant tone at the No Kings day rally in Everett, Washington, where thousands of people attended on Saturday.
“As governor, I promise you one thing above all else, we will never, ever under any circumstances, bend the knee to this autocrat,” he said of President Donald Trump.
In Everett, roughly 4,000 people attended the demonstration, according to Snohomish County Indivisible, the event organizers. The gathering remained peaceful, with attendees holding signs saying “defend democracy” and “no kings.”
Ferguson’s speech focused on defending democracy against authoritarian threats and protecting public health.
In his remarks he cited a letter U.S Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to him in August which threatened to withhold federal funding and prosecute elected leaders if they failed to cooperate with immigration enforcement.
“I can sum up the response letter with two words, hell no,” Ferguson said.
Ferguson said democracies die by a slow, steady erosion of civil liberties and free speech, a gradual consolidation of power in one individual, and prosecuting political enemies with criminal charges.
“Despite the challenges we’re facing as a country, no state in the country, no state in the country, is doing more to stand up to this administration and this autocrat than Washington state,” Ferguson said.
He brought up the West Coast Health Alliance, a public health alliance formed by 15 Democratic governors that Washington state joined. This alliance is aimed to protect public health by breaking away from the guidance of the Trump administration and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
“Robert, that guy’s a crank, right?” Ferguson said. “Unfortunately, he’s in charge of public health for our country.”

Anita Dietrich, founder of Snohomish County Indivisible, described the actions of Trump as reckless, corrupt and more dangerous than ever.
“They want us silent while they target immigrant families, while they strip our rights, shred our schools, hand our future to billionaire cronies and act like kings above the law,” Dietrich said. “But America has no kings, not now, not ever.”
The first No Kings day was held in June and drew hundreds of thousands of people to the streets. It was one of the largest protests in Seattle’s history and in Olympia, over 5,000 people attended.
In the demonstration on Saturday, people began to gather around 12 p.m. near the Snohomish county courthouse in Everett. The official event with speakers began around 1 p.m.. and finished shortly after 2 p.m. once it started raining.
In Olympia, meanwhile, an estimated 4,000 people, some in costume and most toting signs emblazoned with personal political messages, attended the rally at the state Capitol.
Seated on the steps of the Capitol and Temple of Justice, they cheered loudly as David Reaves, senior pastor of New Life Baptist Church in Lacey, proclaimed to the “architects of mischief, your time is up.”
“This is a call to the real America. Hold onto hope and protect it fiercely,” he said, imploring attendees to commit to be actively engaged. “Whatever you do, damn it, do something,” he said.
The hour-long event ended with the crowd singing the National Anthem
Throngs of people headed to the grassy area around Tivoli Fountain, visiting information tents of event organizers, churches and political groups. Dozens stood alongside Capitol Way, waving signs as a brigade of cars carrying supporters passed by.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — More than 1,000 protesters gathered around the Nebraska Capitol this weekend to protest against the Trump administration.
Saturday wasn’t the first crop of No Kings protests in the state; there were a dozen similar protests in June. This time around, there are 15. The protesters held anti-Trump signs criticizing the callousness of the administration’s immigration enforcement efforts and cuts to federal services. Some chanted for President Donald Trump “to go.” 
Some protesters, who did not give their names, said they were happy with the turnout, citing frustrations over the president’s deployment of the National Guard to Democratic-led cities and attacks on transgender rights as frustrations. 
The Nebraska protests were part of an estimated 1,900 protests nationally on Saturday, No Kings officials estimated. Organizers said people wanted to speak out against “authoritarian policies” and “reaffirm that America has No Kings, and the power belongs to the people.” 
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln told the Examiner that the protests are “what Democracy looks like.” 
“[Democracy] was on my mind as I joined my mom, my son and my neighbors at a peaceful protest … to show love and support for our country and dissent for the current attacks on working families, civil rights, and basic democracy,” she said.

Gov. Jim Pillen shared no details this time around about security preparations, unlike June, when he publicized having activated the National Guard ahead of the first No Kings protests.
“Demonstrations will be actively monitored as they are held across the state and responded to appropriately to ensure the safety and security of the public,” said Laura Strimple, a spokesperson for Pillen.
Much like the midsummer protests, the one outside the Capitol was peaceful, with protesters holding signs by the side of the road as cars passed. Some cars honked in support, while one drove by with “Trump” flags. 
One counter-protester carried a sign that read “no queens” with a picture of former Vice President Kamala Harris. The Nebraska Republican Party called the protests across the state “an imagined, astro-turfed performance by Democrats trying to resuscitate a party in chaos through fear and theatrics.”

“Republicans will keep rallying behind a President who actually puts America first and negotiates peace deals in his spare time,” Nebraska GOP chair Mary Jane Truemper said in a statement.
Democratic and Democratic-aligned groups used the protests to reach potential voters. The Lancaster County Democrats, Stand Up Nebraska and the Democratic Socialists of America held booths. 
Local organizers booked musical performances and speakers. Speakers emphasized the importance of next year’s midterm elections. One of them was State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature. A musician sang “This Land Is Your Land.”
 “I know it’s a dark time in our country right now, and in a state like Nebraska it can sometimes feel impossible to beat billionaires, but I want to offer you some hope,” Dungan told the crowd. “I’m talking with people in their communities … and let me tell you. They’re pissed off, too.”

Most of the rallygoers also marched from the Statehouse to the Governor’s Mansion and back — 1 mile each way — to oppose the Republican governor who was one of Trump’s earliest backers.
The rally drew even more people than the one in June, which coincided with Trump’s birthday and Flag Day, said organizer Sam Gibbons of West Columbia. Similar demonstrations took place in cities across the state, including Greenville, which were among more than 2,600 planned nationwide.
Protesters remained peaceful as they chanted and carried signs down Columbia’s Main Street.
Police blocked off intersections and streets to keep incoming traffic away, but few uniformed officers patrolled the demonstration itself, and no confrontations arose, either at the protest in Columbia or at Falls Park in Greenville.

At issue for protesters was a wide variety of the Trump administration’s policies, including recent waves of deportations, federal cuts to health care research and what they considered moves away from democracy.
Attention turned to statewide issues as well.
Gibbons, a state liaison for national group 50501, urged attendees to vote in every election, including local ones, and show up to meetings at the Statehouse on contentious bills, such as the nearly total abortion ban scheduled for a second hearing next month.
Local demonstrations are also important in continuing to press for change, Gibbons said.
“Protests do matter,” the 34-year-old told the thousands gathered. “They may not immediately change policy or culture, but they can stir something within your soul.”
The crowd stood outside the gate of the Governor’s Mansion for about 15 minutes and chanted, “Henry Mac has got to go,” a shortening of Gov. Henry McMaster’s name.
McMaster was the first statewide official to back Trump ahead of South Carolina’s 2016 first-in-the-South GOP presidential primary. Then the lieutenant governor, McMaster ascended to governor in January 2017 when Trump picked Nikki Haley to be his first United Nations ambassador. McMaster, who went on to win two full terms and can’t run again, has been a staunch Trump supporter ever since.
Gibbons then swapped in names of other Republican politicians, including Attorney General Alan Wilson and U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace. Both are among five Republicans who have announced bids to replace McMaster in 2026.
No one came out from the Governor’s Mansion to address the crowd.
Change can come from persistent protests, said the Rev. Susie Smith of Clemson, a former pastor at Peace Congregational Church and a longtime activist.
She pointed to the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse grounds as one example. For years, Smith was among those who sat around the flag on Saturdays and called for its removal. Legislators voted to take it down in 2015 after the hate-fueled massacre of nine people at a historic Black church in Charleston, known at Mother Emanuel, including its pastor, Sen. Clementa Pinckney. But Smith attributed its removal at least in part to calls from activists.
“Sometimes, it takes a crowd like you showing up week after week after week,” Smith said, to the cheering of the crowd.
In a red state like South Carolina, showing politicians that many people disagree with them and their policies is especially important, said Libby Davis. The 21-year-old from Columbia, dressed as the Statue of Liberty, said she hoped the turnout Saturday showed a widespread discontent with Trump. The name of the protest and many of the signs opposed what attendees view as a lack of checks and balances in the federal government, making it akin to a monarchy.

“This crown should be the only crown in America,” Davis said, pointing to the crown on her own head, which mirrored the one atop the statue in New York City.
Dietician Deb Waldron joined thousands at Falls Park in Greenville because she was concerned about Trump’s cuts to the National Institutes of Health, she said.
“(Health Secretary) Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is anti-vax, which is dangerous to Americans,” Waldron said. “He’s cutting science and medical research.”
Kennedy’s slogan is Make America Healthy Again, but Waldron contends the opposite is happening.
Thy Nguyen, a 19-year-old whose family moved to Columbia from Vietnam five years ago, said she loved America and hates seeing some of Trump’s changes. In particular, she worries about tariffs causing prices to rise and people getting deported, she said.
Nguyen added she’s not worried about her own presence in the country, but she worries about the country’s future.
“I got my citizenship for a reason,” Nguyen said. “Ain’t no way that (Trump) ruins this.”

Sitting apart from the main body of the Greenville rally in the shade, Connor Roper, 22, a transgender man, and his two friends said they came to the protest to support transgender rights. The three expressed concern about anti-transgender legislation and the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric.
Roper said he had considered leaving the country.
“I grew up here and it’s been scary,” Roper said. “I’m not blind to how transgender people are treated here, but I still love the area. The writing on the wall is pretty plain, but I don’t want to have to emigrate. I don’t want to leave my grandma. I don’t know how much time she has left.”
Several protesters dressed in a variety of costumes, including a unicorn and a hippo. Greenville resident Kelly Foster attended the rally dressed as a nun.
“I don’t think things are going well with this administration and I’m fearful that things will get worse,” she said.
Foster said she chose a nun’s costume to promote peace.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)COTTONWOOD FALLS — Kay Krause was searching for a way to make a difference with so much “craziness happening around us.”
So she meditated.
That’s how she came up with the idea to try to make life better for immigrants who are housed at the Chase County Detention Center a half-mile from her house.
“You don’t have to take a political stand to support people that are imprisoned,” she said. “That’s a love stand.”
Krause has collected more than $5,000 to support the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees, providing them with postcards and stamps. The jail can hold about 150 detainees who are in transition to larger facilities elsewhere in the country, with some only there for 48 hours and most gone in two weeks. That’s not enough time for them to be assigned a federal ID number. Without the postcards and stamps, their families wouldn’t know where they are or where they are going, Krause said.
Krause also has organized jail-sanctioned donations of soccer balls, games and other items through an Amazon gift registry, and she is planning a pizza party for detainees during Thanksgiving week.
On Saturday, she expanded her efforts by hosting a “love in action” rally at her house. The gathering of 13 in the rural town of about 800 people was among the smallest of the 42 No Kings events that were planned across the state as part of a nationwide uprising.
Krause’s event was different because it focused on kindness rather than the anger toward the Trump administration that brought the attendees together around a campfire in her backyard. Trump won about 75% of the Chase County votes in last year’s election.
“At some point, this whole mess is going to be over, and then what are we going to do?” she said in an interview earlier in the week. “We’ve got to start building bridges. We’ve got to start seeing our neighbors as neighbors and not enemies. We’ve just got to start reaching out and looking for the good in each other, because it’s there. It’s just covered up with all this craziness.”
The attendees included a couple from Wichita, a local folksinger, a professional musician from Colorado, and a Topeka man who was protesting Trump for a 164th consecutive day.

A tortoiseshell cat and two large dogs listened in as Randall McKinnon, of Fairplay, Colorado, and Rodney Bates, who lives just east of nearby Strong City, played Kris Kristofferson’s “Here Comes This Rainbow Again,” which was inspired by a chapter from “The Grapes of Wrath,” and John Denver’s “Take Me Home, Country Roads.”
McKinnon was in between gigs in Kansas City and Wichita. He said he appreciated the rally’s focus on “acts of love.”
“There’s enough hatred going on out there,” McKinnon said. “I could have gone to some of the metro area protests, where they have a little different flavor to them, but I left my inflatable frog suit at home.”
His comment was a reference to viral images of protesters dancing in costume outside an ICE office in Portland, Oregon.
Bates, an 80-year-old who arrived with a dobro, said he has been “negative about monarchy” since he was in grade school. He lamented the way politics have “degenerated into gang warfare,” where people wear either a red or blue bandana.
“I think this is more extreme than even the ’60s,” he said. “For a long time, I thought it was kind of like the ’60s all over again, but I think it’s gone farther, more extreme.”
Marcia Freund, of Wichita, said she believes the Trump presidency is different from others because “the power grab is so much worse.”
She said Trump isn’t taking care of America, and she worried about people who are at risk of losing food assistance because of the government shutdown.
“Here we’re having these little protests, and he has an insurrection, but he acts like we’re the hateful ones,” Freund said.
She attended with her husband, Dave, who said: “You can’t print what I want to say.”

Thomas Muther, of Topeka, said he has protested in towns from northwest to southeast Kansas, as well as in Missouri and Arkansas. He plans to continue his streak of 164 consecutive days of protests until Trump leaves office.
Why?
“I’m a fan of democracy,” he said. “I’m not a fan of autocracy.”
“But there are lots and lots of reasons,” Muther added. “I think immigrants should be treated fairly. I think the law should be followed by everybody, especially including the president.”
Krause led the group in meditation. She asked them to take deep breaths, to be aware of the smell of the campfire and the sounds around them, and to try to lift their problems off their shoulders for a moment.
“It’s so easy to fall into the muck pond, where things are hard,” Krause told them. “We get overwhelmed with fear, anger, at things happening around us. We miss those opportunities to be fully present to what is. And in this moment, right here, right now, all is well.”
After the meditation, she walked down the street handing out roses on her way to the Dollar General store, where she paid for a man’s order.
“Just for a moment, people smiled,” she said. “And these days, I’ll take it.”

Debo Powers, on Oct. 18, 2025. (Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)HAMILTON — DILLON — POLEBRIDGE — Kent Kernahan, of Corvallis, said he’s a Methodist minister’s child, and he demonstrated Saturday at the No Kings Indivisible Bitterroot rally after asking himself what his father would have done.
Kernahan carried a sign that said, “Lord, Please Forgive Trump,” along with an image of the Gadsden “Don’t Tread On Me” image.
Among more than 700 people who lined several blocks of U.S. Highway 93 in downtown Hamilton, Kernahan said the symbol represents opposition to the king of England stepping on the colonies, but it’s misunderstood by some who claim it.
“I don’t think it means what they think it means,” Kernahan said. 
No Kings Indivisible Bitterroot, part of a national No Kings rally and among a couple of dozen planned demonstrations in Montana, took place in Hamilton, a smaller community of roughly 5,000 in the Bitterroot Valley.
Montana supported GOP President Donald Trump with 58% of the vote in 2024, but Ravalli County, a Republican stronghold in the red Bitterroot, backed him with 69%.
Nonetheless, Montanans turned out in traditionally red communities, such as Dillon, with a population of roughly 4,000, and they gathered in tiny outposts such as Polebridge, on the edge of Glacier National Park, which almost saw more demonstrators than full-time residents.
Most of the people who turned out to demonstrate appeared to be those who had already opposed Trump, the brash leader pushing the boundaries of presidential authority in his second term, and before the government shutdown, which has seen 700,000 federal workers furloughed.
But demonstrators said they rallied to show support for democracy, for the U.S. Constitution, for civil liberties, for federal workers, for immigrants, for their own grandchildren, for health care, for the proper use of military troops, and for science and research.
Cherie Garofalo, a local organizer of Indivisible, said the aim of the gathering was to protect liberties in the country for all, for her children, friends and neighbors.
“I really believe this is about freedom,” Garofalo said.
Debo Powers, a Democratic state Representative who organized a rally near the northern entrance of Glacier National Park, said it was the duty of Americans to take to their local streets and make their voices heard.   
“We have got to resist. It’s the patriotic thing to do,” Powers said.

 Bitterrooters rally for freedom, democracy 

Stephen Goheen, of Corvallis, held up a sign that read, “Scientists Save Lives,” not far from a National Institutes of Health biomedical research facility in Hamilton, the Rocky Mountain Laboratories.
“If we don’t fund our scientists, we won’t be ready for the next diseases,” Goheen said.
For example, he said, the mRNA vaccine was based on research that had taken place over many years, and it proved valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The work that scientists do sometimes doesn’t show its value until years down the line,” Goheen said.
The Rocky Mountain Laboratories has employed roughly 500 people in recent years, according to KFF.
The lab, controversial in the Bitterroot, will run on a skeleton crew during the shutdown after roughly a dozen workers lost their jobs in February and other employees opted for early retirements, according to Lee Enterprises.
Not everyone at Saturday’s events was opposed to Trump, though, and Betty Belshe, of Hamilton, said she’s actually opposed to the lab, which studies infectious diseases and is designated a BSL-4 facility, a maximum containment laboratory.
She said she fears people in the Bitterroot might be exposed to biochemical hazards from the lab.
“If it gets out in our air, it’s going to harm us,” Belshe said.
Saturday, Belshe demonstrated to show support for Trump and his bold actions, including cutting government.
“We’ve got way too many government employees,” Belshe said. 
Belshe and her husband, Casey Leedy, both of Hamilton, stood next to a flag that read, “Vote Republican,” but they appeared to be in the minority along the highway.
Brooke Hillyer, wearing a Smokey Bear top, said she dressed to show her support for national parks and the U.S. Forest Service, and the bear is the best representative for that message.
National parks have remained open during the shutdown, and some conservation advocates worry the public resources will be damaged without proper staffing.
“I believe that Trump is ruining our country, what we stand for,” Hillyer said.
Susan Crawford, of Corvallis, said she doesn’t believe she’s being represented by Montana’s federal delegation, politicians who have ceded their power to the president.
“They’re giving up duties that we voted them in to do,” Crawford said.
Nancy Neal of Corvallis, Montana, counted more than 700 participants at the No Kings Indivisible Bitterroot rally in Hamilton on Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025. Neal said she’s not using the term “antifa” anymore. She said it’s “anti-fascist.” (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)
She held a sign that read, “The Only White House Thrones ‘R’ Porcelain.”
“We are experiencing someone in the White House who is acting omnipotent, and we’re letting him,” Crawford said. “He does not deserve a throne, and we don’t want him on a throne, except this one.”
Although the theme of the rally was No Kings, Dean Knudsen, of Hamilton, said he had a different idea about a king.
In Montana, 55% of people are Christian, and Knudsen stood on one corner of the highway with a compilation of signs that read, “Jesus is King,” and “Jesus, Our Only Hope.”
“There is a king, and his name is Jesus,” Knudsen said.
On the opposite corner, Megan Kelly, in a puffy chicken costume just for “sh**s and giggles,” held a sign that read, “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses …”
She said closing down the government meant shutting people out of the things they need, such as education and health care, the opposite of helping those who are tired and poor. 
“I am letting the government know that the American people are not to be messed with,” Kelly said. 
Ron Osborn, a veteran of the Korean War, held up a sign that said, “The Military Defends Freedom. Don’t Use It To Crush It.”
Osborn, almost 93, said he believes the Trump administration’s approach to the military is “a disgrace.” Montana has a high number of military veterans, roughly 9% of the population. 
He said Pete Hegseth, head of the Department of Defense, or Department of War as the Trump administration has attempted to rebrand it, is “fully unqualified,” and the former Fox News television personality has no business leading the military or lecturing admirals.
Osborn and his wife, Nancy Osburn, took to the streets to show their patriotism.
“We’re proud American citizens, loyal to the flag and the Constitution,” Ron Osborn said.
Alla Brooks said she’s a child of immigrants, “an anchor baby,” and she held a sign with a picture of the Statue of Liberty that read, “I’m with her.”
“She was at the head of our harbor,” Brooks said.
She said her parents grew up in repressive Poland, and they drummed into their children the freedoms of America and the First Amendment.
Doug Hatchimonji’s parents, both Japanese, were interned in camps in the U.S. during World War II, and he said it’s important to protect people’s rights to speak, protest and assemble.
“It’s sad and disappointing that an old story continues to be repeated again and again,” said Hatchimonji, of Hamilton, and spouse of Garofalo. “It’s the same story, blaming people of color for problems that they didn’t create.”
One Trump priority is deporting people who are in the country illegally, but law enforcement authorities under his administration have detained many people who have the right to be in the United States, including Americans and elected officials.
Kandice Gren, in a red gnome dress and pointy hat, said she was concerned about the new reduction in the distribution of power among the three branches of government.
Her sign read, “Gnomes say NO KINGS!”
Montanans are practical people, and Gren explained her getup.
“It’s the only costume I own,” Gren said.

 Frustrated participants convene for Dillon’s largest demonstration

About 200 people showed up to line North Montana Street through Dillon, and they held signs, played guitars and talked with one another. At least one participant told the Daily Montanan it appeared to be the biggest the town has seen.
For Emilee Gates, 26, who helps people navigate the social safety net as part of her job, coming to the event in Dillon was in part born out of frustration. One action the Trump administration has taken is to severely cut the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, calling it “unnecessary.”
What that means for one person Gates has worked with is that instead of $1,500 to pay for energy, they now have $150.
“That’s one propane fill up,” Gates said, saying that the man was living in a camper — which is legal in Montana she added.
Some people attended the rally from Ennis and Twin Bridges, organizers said, even carpooling to get there.

 Polebridge protest exceeds local population 

More than 60 people gathered to take part in a No Kings Indivisible rally in the hamlet of Polebridge, in the borderlands of Glacier National Park, locally organized by Rep. Powers.
The area surrounding Polebridge is colloquially known as the North Fork, and boasts around 100 year-round residents, including Powers. 
“Almost all of the people here are North Forkers, so they’re my constituents,” Powers told the Daily Montanan. “There were a few tourists who were coming to Glacier Park, saw us, and they joined us. That was fun, but mostly it’s people who are my neighbors.”
An intersection of dirt roads is home to the iconic red Polebridge Mercantile — and its equally iconic huckleberry bear claws — standing sentinel near the northernmost entrance to Glacier.
Armed with signs, flags, and costumes, the ralliers circled up in the dirt intersection, occasionally parting ways to let cars headed into the national park squeeze through, along with one disgruntled carload of tourists who grumbled about not needing to be confronted with politics as they walked into the Mercantile to get coffee and pastries. 
Powers, who served in her first Legislative session as an elected official this year, greeted most people by name and at noon pulled out her megaphone. 
“I swore a sacred oath to protect the Constitution of the United States and the constitution of Montana,” she said. “The problem we have today is we have some people who are ignoring their own sacred oaths of office.”
Focusing on the theme of the nationwide rallies — expected to be among the highest participation protest events in history — Powers reminded those gathered that 250 years ago, residents of what would become the United States made a decision to not have a king. 
“We made that decision already, and we did not unmake it,” she said, to responding cheers of “no kings!” 
Not standing up and making their voices heard could be detrimental to residents of Montana, she continued. 
“If we are silent, we could lose it all. We could lose our public lands. We could lose our public education. We could lose our social security and medicare. We could lose our sacred right to vote in free and fair elections,” Powers said. 
Powers represents House District 3, which encompasses the North Fork border of Glacier Park, as well as half of Whitefish. She told the Daily Montanan she felt it was her duty to host a No Kings rally for her community, especially since the next closest one, in Kalispell, is a nearly two-hour drive away. 
“I just asked for seven people to show up so we would have enough to spell out “N-O K-I-N-G-S,” she said. “It’s important to gather close to home, and it’s important to see people in small villages, in red states, not just in big blue cities. This group would get swallowed up there, but here, we stand out.”

				Republican officials nationwide have branded the No Kings demonstrations as “Hate America” rallies.
Montana’s senior U.S. Sen. Steve Daines echoed those statements in an appearance on Fox Business this week. “As Speaker Johnson correctly said, this is a “We hate America rally” and the bottom line is the Democrats and the far left are very upset at the fact they lost the election last November. President Trump won in a landslide, we reclaimed the United States Senate, and we have the House. They are frustrated. They are angry. But sadly they are expressing their anger and frustration by shutting down the government and hurting the American people.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/No_Kings_polebridge_06-1024x707.jpg,,,2025-10-18 18:57:57.339874
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-10-18 22:41:03+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Finding common cause and common sense in complexity,James Peyser,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/finding-common-cause-and-common-sense-in-complexity/,"“THERE’S A PLACE in the world for the angry young man,” wrote Billy Joel almost 50 years ago.  Unfortunately, that place seems to have expanded in our public square (for […]","“THERE’S A PLACE in the world for the angry young man,” wrote Billy Joel almost 50 years ago.  Unfortunately, that place seems to have expanded in our public square (for both men and women), creating echo chambers of primal screaming on both the right and left, leaving the large majority of us wondering where all the middle ground went. 
For much of the past year, I’ve been writing a series of issue briefs for CommonWealth Beacon on a variety of controversial policy topics (see below), providing evidence-based arguments pro and con, in contrast to the bumper stickers from the left and right that too often pass for civic discourse. 
There are two main points to the series. 
First, even though almost every policy issue has ethical and philosophical dimensions, there are also complicated practical and technical aspects that make many if not most decisions closer calls, involving real-world trade-offs and unintended consequences. 
Second, when you don’t view the opposing side as morally bankrupt or just plain ignorant, there may actually be opportunities for finding common or higher ground, maybe not to reach a final consensus, but at least to take a step forward together. 
The tendency towards reductionism in most policy debates these days often makes a meeting of the minds next to impossible and compromise equivalent to surrender. 
Should Boston enact rent control? Activists in favor say affordable housing is a fundamental human right, while advocates on the other side say free markets and private property stand between us and big-government tyranny. 
Should the state stop prison construction? The left says prisons are inhumane centers of mass incarceration, while the right says “lock ‘em up.” 
Should Massachusetts adopt voter ID requirements? The right says, “stop the steal,” while the left cries “voter suppression.” 
Should the Commonwealth pay reparations to descendants of slaves? Advocates in favor say it’s a matter of overdue social justice, while opponents claim it’s just a performative “woke” hand out. 
Should school librarians make final decisions about which books to stock on the shelves? The left warns against book bans, while the right defends parents’ rights. 
It turns out in all these controversies the facts aren’t always so clear or one-sided, and reasonable people can disagree.  Even when it seems like there is no common ground at all, we need to have enough self-awareness of our own fallibility and respect for the honestly held beliefs of others, no matter how misguided we may think they are, to hold on loosely to our own positions so we can view the other side as temporary opponents, rather than permanent enemies. 
Deciding which side you’re on should at least require an open-minded consideration of the opposing arguments. 
Think the cost of housing in Boston is outrageously high?  Consider whether price controls would suppress the supply of new rental apartments. 
Think prisons keep our communities safe?  Consider the extent to which former prisoners continue to commit crimes after finishing their sentences. 
Think voter ID laws are inherently discriminatory? Consider the high rates of minority voter turnout in states that already have such requirements. 
Think reparations are unjustified? Consider the enormity of the Black-White wealth gap, 160 years after the end of slavery and 60 years after passage of the Civil Rights Act. 
Think school library book bans are threatening free speech and inclusivity?  Consider how few communities in Massachusetts have actually removed books from the shelves. 
There’s no doubt that these debates are fraught with serious differences in values and world views, and righteous rage (as Billy Joel might say) can indeed prick the conscience and spur action. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t dial down the rhetoric and personal attacks in order to get on with the more prosaic and pragmatic business of policymaking. 
The goal is not to confuse or paralyze, but to acknowledge and clarify the inescapable choices in public policy, while encouraging humility, civility, and even empathy in our public discourse. 
As a matter of long-term self-interest, if nothing else, we need to keep in mind that even if “our side” wins this round, the wheel will inevitably turn, and the balance of forces will no longer be in your favor. Total victory today leads to hard feelings and long memories that can become total defeat tomorrow. As fellow citizens, this is an unsustainable pattern that can only end in calamity, not just for some, but for all. 
As we enter the final days of another polarized election season, let’s look forward to the coming year as a time to get off our high horses and embrace the complexity of the real world in hopes of restoring some semblance of common cause, as well as commonsense.

It wasn’t a traffic jam — from noon to 3 p.m. Saturday, a steady stream of cars and trucks were honking their support for a No Kings protest that lined both sides of the divided highway, drawing thousands of demonstrators frustrated with the Trump administration.
The rally was awash with colorful characters — among them the Cookie Monster from the children’s show “Sesame Street,” a pink axolotl, dinosaurs and dragons of many different hues and giant yellow chickens.
Erin Grabau, who came wearing a skeletal unicorn ensemble, said she was inspired by demonstrators in Portland who dressed in inflatable frog costumes — but decided on a less elaborate outfit because, “in this economy, no, I’m sorry.”

“It was making a point of showing we’re not violent,” Grabau said. “We’re not causing violence. You can’t turn the narrative.”
Matt Mercer, spokesperson for the North Carolina Republican Party, condemned the protesters as radicals damaging the country.
“Far-left radical Democrats shut down the federal government to brag at these events they shut down the government to stop President Trump,” Mercer said in a statement. “These manufactured events do nothing but highlight how out of touch the radical left is with the American people and here in North Carolina, thousands of voters every month reject being labeled a Democrat.”
Gary Lucido, a Texas transplant in North Carolina, said he had voted Republican all his life before President Donald Trump came along. He said GOP descriptions of No Kings as “Hate America” protests — as Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) called them — are a “bunch of crap.”
“We love America. We’re here because we want to preserve America,” Lucido said at the Raleigh No Kings protest. “The ones that hate it are the ones that don’t believe in the Constitution.”
For many protesters, the No Kings rally was a family outing. All along Capital Boulevard, children and toddlers could be seen with their parents, some wearing costumes or face coverings of their own and others resting in strollers.
“They need to know when it’s appropriate to stand and fight, and sometimes standing and fighting is standing in a silly costume on the side of the road with a sign and screaming at the top of your lungs,” Grabau said.
Some also brought their four-legged friends. Jeffrey Cohn, a medical writer from Clayton, brought his dogs Bindi and Obi to the No Kings protest in Raleigh, and despite the honking and cheers, they stayed calm as can be.
Cohn came dressed as President Donald Trump’s error-filled “Liberation Day” tariff information sheet. He said it was a relief to be in the company of so many people just as distressed as he is at the direction America has taken.
“We are a majority, and the folks who are trying to destroy and burn, whether it’s for political reasons, whether it’s for Christian Nationalism, white supremacy reasons — there’s more of us who don’t feel that way than do feel that way,” he said.








The soundtrack at the protest was an eclectic combination, with David Bowie and Bob Dylan bleeding into No Doubt’s “Just a Girl” and Rockwell’s “Somebody’s Watching Me.” Protesters’ costumes and flags called to mind various pop culture icons, with one protester flying the flag of the rebellion from “Star Wars” and others dressed as characters like No Face from the anime film “Spirited Away.”

Top of mind for many of the rally-goers was fair voting maps, with North Carolina set to become the latest state to draw new districts at Trump’s direction to shore up the Republican majority in the House of Representatives ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
“Gerrymandering is cheating!” read one protester’s sign. Another featured QR codes linking to the proposed new congressional map and a submission form for public comment. “Tell the NC General Assembly: Stop gerrymandering,” that sign urged.
Recent polling shows that a vast majority of North Carolinians oppose partisan gerrymandering, including 87% of Democrats and 78% of Republicans.
Donna and Larry Shipman, activists who recently relocated from Pennsylvania, also came to No Kings to fight for their right to vote, pointing to key Voting Rights Act protections under threat at the U.S. Supreme Court.
“We need to stand up and say, ‘No, you’re not going to take this away from us,’” said Donna Shipman. “The Supreme Court, they say racism is over. No, it’s not.”
The Raleigh event was just one of several in the Triangle area. No Kings protests in Cary, Apex, Durham and Carrboro also saw large turnouts. More than 50 events were planned in North Carolina, organizers said, among some 2,600 nationwide.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA184532-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-18 18:57:57.339874

People told the Reformer they were there to fight for democracy against the threat of what they say is President Donald Trump’s overreach, including deploying the National Guard to cities, deporting immigrants without due process and cutting off federal funds to Democratic states.
Protestors carried signs decrying authoritarianism — “No Kings, No Fascists” — and condemning U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — “I like my democracy neat. Hold the ICE.”

The last No Kings rally was June 14, the day of the assassination of Mark and Rep. Melissa Hortman. Thousands of people showed up to the Minnesota State Capitol that day, despite advice from local law enforcement to stay home, to protest against the Trump administration’s slide into tyranny.
Republicans previewed Saturday’s event in recent days by calling it a “hate America” rally associated with a “pro-terrorist” wing of the Democratic Party, claims belied by the peaceful crowd, which was marked by playfulness as much as anger.

Alex Kaiser, 29, said that wearing his frog costume helps “deflate the message that we’re terrorists or these awful people. Obviously that’s not the case. We all love our country and are trying to make it a better place.”
Dinosaur-clad Pat Bear, 57, said, “It’s really important that we show that we’re not happy with what’s going on, and we’ll do it peacefully.” Bear decried Trump’s immigration policy and the “graft he has going on with crypto,” referring to Trump and his family making millions from opaque crypto deals even since he’s become president.

Sarah Harding, 35, dressed as a penguin, was at the rally to protest ICE and said she wore the costume to show that “we’re peaceful people” and to “bring ridiculousness to what’s happening.”
Jack Harding, 35, Sarah’s spouse, also in a penguin suit “to show the absurdity of it. America has $40 billion to give to ICE but not enough to make health care affordable.”
Another dinosaur, Nick Robinson, 42, said he was there to “stand up for democracy.”
“Bypassing checks and balances in government is definitely something that upsets me,” Robinson said.
Robinson’s sister, Michelle Wheeler, 33, added, “Donald Trump is playing directly out of the fascist, authoritarian playbook. I’m here to stand up for my family and show my kids what it means to fight for democracy.”

Wheeler said she wants Democrats to feel emboldened by the nationwide rallies. “The shutdown is the bare minimum Democrats should be doing to protect our health care, but it’s by no means going far enough,” Wheeler said. “Minnesota Democrats are playing by the old rules when the game has changed. We need to see them thinking outside the box.”

(Photo by Mary Iuvone for New Jersey Monitor)Thousands of New Jersey residents took their rage — and ridicule — to the streets Saturday during the latest national No Kings protests, with some wearing silly costumes to push back on critics’ claims that protesters are violent, anti-American extremists.
Critics of President Donald Trump mobbed more than two dozen towns in the Garden State, from Newton down to Cape May Court House, to accuse his administration of “authoritarianism.”
Critics, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have derided the mass day of action as a “Hate America rally” bound to draw “Antifa types.” The No Kings protesters were happy to nix that notion.
Daniel Buchanan of Union County showed up to a rally outside the Statehouse in Trenton in an inflatable traffic cone costume, while Amy Bruno of Ewing wore an inflatable unicorn outfit and called herself “Aunt Tifa.” In Princeton, a bean bag frog balanced on Susan Steen’s baseball cap carried its own tiny sign declaring: “I AM AMPHIFA.” Nearby, Sarah Schwimmer wore colorful fringe from head to toe in her piñata costume. “Because I  our Democracy (even more than I love candy!),” her sign said.
“We’re just trying to exercise our First Amendment rights and protest, and yet we’re being painted as terrorists and as violent. We’ve been trying different ways to show that that’s silly, and we mean no harm, and we’re not violent, and the whole point is to get a message out,” Buchanan said.
His message: “Those in power only care about themselves and their own agenda. We’re not going to just sit and be quiet and be OK with it. There’s a lot more people than they think that are against this.”

The protests came amid a government shutdown now in its third week, federal deployments of National Guard troops to police several U.S. cities, and immigration agents carrying out Trump’s mass deportation mission. Protesters denounced such actions as an unacceptable, escalating assault on the American people.
“How many sins have they committed against us? How many wounds have they inflicted on us? Too many!” Andrei Camurungan, an organizer with 50501, shouted at the crowd in Trenton.
Laura Hunt of Burlington Township said she was protesting because she feels the U.S. is “in a crisis situation.” She listed several concerns, ranging from Trump’s immigration crackdowns to “his words towards women.”
“He was talking about the leader of Italy, talking about how beautiful she is. What planet is he from? What century is he in?” Hunt said. “He is a horrible, horrible excuse for a human being. I’m disgusted.”
Millions were expected to attend about 2,600 rallies around the nation, making Saturday the largest mass day of action since the start of Trump’s first term, when the largest single-day mobilization included about 750 rallies, national organizers said.
“This is a genuinely nationwide phenomenon. It is occurring in rural places. It is occurring in urban areas. It is occurring in red places and blue places. The public backlash to Donald Trump and his regime of cronies and corruption and attacks on our rights is incredibly widespread,” said Leah Greenberg, a co-founder and co-executive director of the Indivisible Project.



































































































































































































In Princeton, hundreds of people packed the sprawling block-long park in front of the municipal building.
Sandy Landman of East Brunswick was there with a posterboard listing just some of her concerns about Trump — and they filled both sides.
“Terrible things are going on in this country. Your free speech is being limited. He’s taking money from taxpayers, enriching himself. He’s giving it to Argentina, of all places. He’s taking that tunnel project out of New York because he’s punishing Democratic states and cities — it’s ridiculous. ICE, to me, mirrors the Gestapo. He just freed George Santos, who was an admitted criminal. Health care — it should be a right, not something that you have to fight for constantly,” she said. “We have a lot of things that we need to protest this administration about, because they’re not taking care of the people.”
The protests also became a place to politick, with Dale Caldwell, a Democrat who’s running to become New Jersey’s next lieutenant governor on a slate with gubernatorial hopeful Mikie Sherrill, stopping by the Trenton rally. He urged protesters to vote in the Nov. 4 election, saying Trump — who endorsed Sherrill’s Republican rival, Jack Ciattarelli — wants them to stay home from the polls.

“Trump has a Supreme Court abdicating their responsibility, has a Republican Congress abdicating responsibility. If Jack Ciattarelli is governor, New Jersey is going to abdicate our responsibility, ICE is going to be roaming the streets, the National Guard is going to be roaming the streets,” Caldwell said.
He added: “All of you here know how important it is to vote, but you’ve got to tell your family, you’ve got to tell your friends, we’re fighting against apathy. We’re fighting against people staying home, not voting. Trump is discouraging people, and he’s winning when he does that.”
Sherrill appeared at the No Kings protest in Montclair after headlining a campaign rally in Paramus with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D). State Sen. Holly Schepisi, a Bergen County Republican, told reporters outside the Paramus rally that she finds Sherrill’s appearance at a No Kings rally “ironic” because Gov. Phil Murphy (D) and Whitmer issued myriad directives in 2020 without legislative approval that ordered business closures, lockdowns, and other actions related to the COVID-19 spread.
“To be doing No Kings protests in New Jersey, when her party, her governor, the governor she invited, were directly responsible for taking away all of the civil liberties, doing everything pursuant to executive order, and causing the deaths of our most vulnerable in the state, I find it to be unconscionable,” she said.

About 15 protests were scheduled around Alabama, part of over 2,600 demonstrations scheduled on Saturday that were expected to draw millions of people. Speakers and participants criticized the administration’s seizure of power; its arrest and detention of immigrants and its policies toward health care. Others said Trump administration policies were hurting members of their families.
The protests were largely peaceful, with no major incidents reported.
A similar round of protests were held in June and drew millions of people to 1,500 sites nationwide. About 14 of those protests were held in Alabama that day with thousands of people in attendance.
Crowd sizes varied, from about 40 people in Selma to up to 2,000 in Birmingham. Here are reports from four of the protests on Saturday.
Birmingham: Calls for community and activism

A crowd of approximately 2,000 people gathered in Railroad Park Saturday for Birmingham’s “No Kings” protest, hearing from speakers including former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones before peacefully marching along a seven-block parade route, carrying signs and engaging in call-and-response chants while drivers honked their horns in support.
“We’re here today, like so many more that have come to Birmingham before us, not just for a No Kings rally but for civil rights, for anti-war protests, you name it, to speak out about injustices when they see it,” Jones told the cheering audience that filled the park’s pavilion and spilled onto a hillside beyond it.
“We’re here because, ‘Freedom is a fragile thing, and it’s never more than a generation away from extinction,’” he continued, quoting Ronald Reagan’s 1967 inaugural address as California’s governor. “Two hundred and fifty years ago, this country was born of one thing that every American generation has reaffirmed: no kings.”
Attendees hailing from Birmingham and surrounding suburbs and towns cited concerns about human rights and vulnerable people, including the poor and immigrants, threats to democracy and freedom of speech, and opposition to President Donald Trump’s policies as reasons they came to the rally.
“I thought it was very important that we come out and that we show, really, as a country, how we feel about what’s going on in our government, how oppressive it is, and that we’re saying, ‘No,’” said DeValerie Williams of Birmingham. “We’re saying, ‘No, we love our country. We want our country to stay a democracy, where we care about each other. And I think the only way to do this is for us to be a show of force.”

We want our country to stay a democracy, where we care about each other. And I think the only way to do this is for us to be a show of force.” (Olivia McMurrey for Alabama Reflector)
In her remarks to the crowd, Rev. Julie Conrady of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Birmingham said the city redefined freedom and equality in 1965.
“Over and over in the history of our country, we, the people, have been the necessary checks and balances to ensure that our country continues to progress, improve and prosper,” Conrady said.
She encouraged people to get involved in local causes.
“There is not a lot we can do at the federal government right now,” Conrady said. “One party controls all three branches of government, and one despot’s marching orders control them all. Our resistance must focus locally and statewide, where together, we can make meaningful change.”
Quoting the words of U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, who called the No Kings protests a “hate-America rally,” attendees and speakers at the Birmingham event said they wanted to correct such misunderstandings.
“There’s a lot of people in this country who care passionately about what’s going on with the current administration and all the corruption and all the lies, taking people’s health care away and giving tax breaks to the rich,” said Greg Fuller of Birmingham. “I think it’s un-American. I think it’s not patriotic. And I think this group is full of people who love America, not hate America, as the speaker said.”
Idania Gonzalez with the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice, told the crowd to look around them because the rally is what community looks like.
“This is what power looks like when people stand together for the same cause, when people stand together for our neighbors who are scared to come out, for our neighbors who are living in the shadows due to political fighting,” she said.

Comedian Rebecca Rothman gave rally goers a primer on how to contact their U.S. representatives and then demonstrated it by calling Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s office and leaving a message. She gave the crowd time to make their own calls and encouraged them to place five calls a day.
Candra Bethune of Birmingham said she’s going to do that. Attending the rally made her feel better, even though things are bad, she said, because before she didn’t know what she could do as one person to make a difference.
“We’ve got to do something to let them know that we don’t want this,” Bethune said.

Montgomery: Warnings about federal policy changes

More than 600 people gathered in downtown Montgomery for the city’s “No Kings” rally.
“The kind of change that we are trying to achieve is not the kind of change that happens fast,” said Tabitha Isner, vice chair of the Alabama Democratic Party, who spoke at the rally. “This is the kind of change that requires we keep showing up. The last time we showed up, we were a good, decent crowd, but this time we are bigger. The next time we show up, we will be even bigger.”
The protest, which began at Riverfront Park, featured people dressed in makeshift costumes displaying dinosaurs and squirrels and others who adorned themselves with colors of the rainbow. Many carried cardboard placards replete with crowns that were crossed out with the words “No Kings” on them.
At 9 a.m. the crowd then marched a quarter mile to the Court Square Fountain, a site where enslaved people were bought and sold prior to the Civil War, to hear from speakers who urged them to continue the public outcry, and who criticized nearly every aspect of Trump’s policies, from mass arrest and deportations of immigrants to tariffs on trade, as well as the budget bill that Congress passed at Trump’s urging that cut funding for social service programs.
Rev. Valtoria Jackson of the Poor People’s Campaign addresses a “No Kings” rally in Montgomery, Alabama on Oct. 18, 2025. “Violence is when people cannot afford a house, violence is when a voter cannot afford medicine, violence is when mothers continue to lose sons and daughters to greed and guns. Violence is when the rich get tax breaks and the poor get evicted,” she told about 600 people at the demonstration. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)
“No king, no crowns, no thrones, only love, because violence is not just bullets and bombs,” said Rev. Valtoria Jackson, Montgomery lead organizer for the Alabama Poor People’s Campaign, said in a speech. “Violence is when people cannot afford a house, violence is when a voter cannot afford medicine, violence is when mothers continue to lose sons and daughters to greed and guns. Violence is when the rich get tax breaks and the poor get evicted.”
Jackson has spoken at numerous gatherings before to raise awareness of the budget bill recently passed by Congress and the potential expiration of expanded tax credits for Affordable Care Act plans that could drive up insurance costs around the nation. The loss of those credits has been a major reason for the ongoing federal government shutdown. The budget bill also reduced funding for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that provides food subsidies to lower-income families and individuals. The bill passes more of the cost of maintaining the programs to the states, and advocates had been warning that the bill could reduce the state’s economy by more than $1 billion and eliminate health insurance coverage for almost 200,000 people.
“Our food pantry participation has gone up 200% since he passed this bill,” said Rev. Manuel Williams in an interview following the event, pastor at Resurrection Catholic Church in Montgomery. “These are people who never had to come and get food assistance, but now they are food insecure.”

Others voiced strong opposition to the administration’s efforts to deport large numbers of immigrants living in the U.S.
“One of my biggest things is the ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids, the deportation of people who are just trying to live,” said Haley Morgan, who attended the protest. “They are getting deported for a taillight being out, or for speeding. If that is the case, deport me because I have sped and my taillight has been out.”
Many of those who gathered also expressed reservations about Trump’s efforts to reshape the federal government.
“I wanted to help protest against all that Trump is doing,” said Judy May, 87, who attended the rally. “He is destroying the constitution. He is trying to take away our right to vote, our rights of free speech. He is firing so many people, taking so many important departments to pieces. He is destroying the Department of Education, he has destroyed the public health department, I just hate everything he is doing.”

Oxford: ‘We are American people who love our country’

Over 200 people gathered along the roads of the Oxford Exchange to protest the Trump administration Saturday under the “No Kings” name.
Protesters of all ages stood along the highway holding signs condemning President Trump for being what they describe as a dictator, demanding the release of the Epstein files and condemning Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
“I’m here today to express my displeasure with the current administration. There are many things being done wrong. I couldn’t even name them, it wouldn’t fit on a sign,” Jim Baker, organizer of the demonstration, said. “I hope somebody hears our cries and our anger and does something about it.”
One protestor said she came to stop the government from continuing the way it is now.
“Things are really scary right now, and if somebody doesn’t say something, and if we don’t keep pushing back, then everything is just going to keep moving in the direction it’s moving. And even if it’s stopping things an inch then it’s worth it,” protestor Cami McKenzie said.
Others just want the government to hear them and their opinions.

“Our government isn’t listening to us. The government is meant to serve us, not control us. So I think it’s important that we stand up before we lose our rights,” protestor Pam Howard said.
Baker said he felt like he was alone when it came to standing up for issues such as healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights and ICE raids.
“It makes me extremely happy that there are this many people in the state of Alabama with the same mindset that I have,” Baker said. “I’ve lived here for 21 years, and for 21 years I thought I was on an island.”
And some of these issues are personal to the ones protesting.
“I have four biologically born female daughters, and two are gender non-conforming, so I’m really bothered by a lot of the talk about trans individuals and stuff,” said Glenda Reeseg.
Alanna Gregg, another protestor, said these issues affect everyone.
“You should be ashamed of yourself if you don’t care,” she said “It shouldn’t have to happen to you for it to matter to you.”
And Baker made it clear that protestors are just regular people who want better for everyone in the country.
“We are not Antifa, we are not insurrectionists. We are American people who love our country and don’t like the direction that it’s going and that’s why we’re here today.
While the overall response from non-protesters was mostly positive with many honking their horns in support of the cause, there were a few that began to heckle the demonstrators.
Halfway through the protest, a small group of Trump supporters stood across the street to heckle the “No Kings” demonstrators. A heated verbal exchange ensued but was quickly settled.
But protesters didn’t let the rude comments from the group dampen their spirits.
“They have every right to be there and we’re fighting for their rights too,” Howard said.
Howard also commended younger people for being at the protest, and not to let anyone deter them from using their voice.
“One thing I want to say to young people is don’t let anybody tell you that your vote doesn’t count. Voter turnout is one of the biggest issues we have in Alabama,” she said. “If you want to see things change, that’s how we change it.”

Selma: ‘We can see each other’

Laurie Kelly and her husband, who live in Chicago, were traveling to the Gulf of Mexico for a beach vacation. Kelly said she asked her husband to find somewhere to stop to protest.
“If we don’t show up, it’s over. This is very important. It’s small, but it’s still here and that does matter,” Kelly said in an interview. “People need to stand up. That’s what I’m trying to do. It’s all I can do.”
The couple joined about 40 people gathered at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge Saturday afternoon for a local No Kings protest.
The Selma protest was the second for some. Jasie Shepard and Dr. Justin Cavanaugh traveled to Selma after the Tuscaloosa No Kings protest ended Saturday morning, about a 90-minute drive.
Nate Bradley and his friends came to Selma after the Montgomery protest ended this morning. He said he is protesting because of President Donald Trump’s disregard of Congress’ power of the purse.

“Now we have a president who says, ‘I’m not going to fund Democrat programs.’ What does that mean?” Bradley said. “He wouldn’t be able to articulate a thought about that. It’s insulting.”
Bradley said the protests in Montgomery and Selma gave him hope.
“I call my representatives, I go to my townhalls,” Bradley said of what he does outside of the No Kings protests. “I just try to stay sane and find a balance between staying sane and keeping up to date with the nonstop deluge of things that this administration is doing or not doing.”
Annie Pearl Avery, a long-time civil rights activist, urged people to protest every day.
“It’s not going to be a lot of show and a lot of talk. There’s going to have to be some action,” Avery said. “You’ve got a purpose. Everyone has a purpose.”
Rev. Leodis Strong, lead pastor at Brown Chapel in Selma, criticized Republicans who claim to be Christian, but do not show it in policies.
“How can you call yourself pro-life when you did not give access to insurance to soon-to-be mothers and soon-to-be children outside the womb? How can you call yourself pro-life when you take away WIC and SNAP?” Strong asked. “That is a polluted religion.”
Jennifer Wright, who recently moved to Selma from Huntsville, criticized Congress for not releasing investigative files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. She urged people to write letters and call their representatives. She also wrote a thank you letter to U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, for his petition to release the files.

“Every member of Congress should have happily signed your petition because child sex trafficking should not be considered a partisan issue and should be considered a crime by everyone,” Massie read.
The petition was one vote short of the 218 it needed to pass in September.
Azali Fortier, 18, said the protest gave her a glimpse of hope.
“I know that they can see us because we can see each other,” Fortier said of the Trump administration and Congress. “We’re about to undergo a big change, either for better or for worse.”
The protest wrapped up with Yomi Goodall leading the group singing “America the Beautiful” and “We Shall Overcome,” a Civil Rights Movement anthem.

Dozens of No Kings protests took place across Ohio as part of more than 2,500 nationally. Organizers reported Saturday afternoon that nearly 7 million Americans attended the protests across the country.
“Today, millions of people showed that we, the people, will not be silenced,” said Deirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer for the American Civil Liberties Union.
The events were sponsored by more than 100 organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the League of Women Voters, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Common Cause, and Indivisible.
In Central Ohio, rallies will took place in communities such as Newark, Reynoldsburg, Marysville, and Grove City earlier Saturday afternoon.

What was full instead was the south side of the State House, where the lawn and marble steps — often places absent of pageantry, except for the occasional photo shoot during prom season — entertained a crowd of more than 30,000 people, according to the organizers of the No Kings protest.
No Kings day brings millions into US streets in anti-Trump protests

The Providence protest is one of just under a dozen such rallies that took place in Rhode Island Saturday meant to protest President Donald Trump’s administration and its policies. 
“Even if some of these signs are not very Christian, all I see is love,” activist and event emcee Alisha Pina said as she looked out toward the crowd from the State House steps. “Sometimes you gotta tell it like it is.” 
Since the last round of No Kings protests on June 14, the number of local demonstrations has increased, and a new idiom has joined the visual grammar of anti-Trumpism: The inflatable animal suit. The trend originated earlier this month in Portland, Oregon, where a viral video of a man in a frog suit getting pepper sprayed by ICE agents only served to inflame, rather than cauterize, the goofy, fan-powered suits as a symbol of farcical resistance. 
There was a menagerie among the crowd in Providence on Saturday. One could find a bumblebee, a lobster, a monkey, two tyrannosauruses (one green, one blue), a shark, an eagle, a pink unicorn, a polar bear, a brown bear, a white unicorn, and two Rhode Island reds holding up a sign that read “RESIST.” A cow and chicken danced to Beyonce’s 2016 song “Freedom” as it played from a loudspeaker. Across the street, a group of friends assisted Snoopy in getting inflated. Even Squidward, SpongeBob’s irascible neighbor, found it in him to attend.

Beyond the diversity of species represented was a variety of people from all ages and backgrounds on the lawn Saturday. Three teenagers perched at the feet of Nathanael Greene, that most trusted general in George Washington’s army who, in statue form, continues to look over the capital from the base of the State House steps. The Democratic Socialists of America had set up an information booth underneath a tree’s shade. A woman who declined to be interviewed sported an outfit with Beanie Baby cats attached, and a sign that read “Cat ladies against Trump.”
Abigail Pimental, originally from Bristol, wore a “Beetlejuice”-inspired costume and held up a sign that said, “Say it three times: Epstein Files, Epstein Files, Epstein Files.”
“I just think that it’s important we hold all people accountable, no matter what side of the aisle they’re on,” Pimental said, and added about the protests in general, “It’s so meaningful that this is happening in New England, the birthplace of our whole democratic freedom.”
There were also a handful of State Police scattered across the lawn and steps, mostly young men who did not show any visible signs of discomfort despite being dressed in weighty, dark-colored uniforms and standing directly in the sun. The 60-degree heat made the day unseasonably warm for mid-October.

A portion of this crowd formed into a caravan that marched past the mall and into downtown Providence starting a little after 1 p.m. With State Police directing the stalled traffic as the marchers began to move, motorists sounded horns — mostly those waving signs from their vehicle windows as they headed for the demonstration themselves. They began to return around 2 p.m., after which the protest’s speaking portion began.
“Thank you for standing with our immigrant community,” Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat and contender for the capital city’s mayorship, said in his remarks to the crowd. “Thank you for standing with our immigrant neighbors. Together we’re going to demonstrate that Rhode Island is a home for everyone, especially our immigrant brothers, sisters, and non-binary friends.”
Morales was not the only state legislator or local elected official who could be seen in attendance. Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, took a moment to chat after weaving her way through the crowd.  
“It’s so heartwarming to know that there are enough people around to care enough about their democracy, about our democracy, to come out and participate,” Tanzi said.
She was handing out stickers and American flags to protestors, and said it was “because we’ve got to take the flag back.”
“The symbolism is for all Americans, and not just for some,” Tanzi said.

“We can no longer view fellow Americans as the enemy,” said 19-year-old college student Django Grace at a rally in Brattleboro. “We need common ground.”

On Saturday morning, a small group of protestors mounted bikes in Barre for “The Rolling Resistance” — a march on wheels to join the main body of “No Kings” demonstrators at the Montpelier Statehouse. 
Barb Schwendtner of Barre Town, the event’s organizer, said her goal was to “combine (her) love of bikes with (her) love of democracy.”
The cyclists rolled into a second round of “No Kings” protests on Saturday, organized in part by the movement 50501, in opposition to the Trump administration’s targeting of immigrants, LGBTQ+ rights, public education, the government shutdown and more, according to the organization’s website. Thousands of Vermonters showed up to more than 40 such events that took place across the state on Saturday, in addition to at least one event organized by Republicans in Chester.
50501, a national movement that opposes “executive overreach” in the federal government, helped organize No Kings rallies nationwide. Indivisible, a national organization with Vermont chapters, was also involved in organizing events across the state.
The event was a reoccurrence of similarly-framed demonstrations against authoritarianism in June, which saw about 42,000 Vermonters take to the streets in protest of the Trump administration’s actions. Millions more attended across the nation.
As the crowd in Barre readied itself for departure, bicycles arrived with a wide, colorful variety of signage draped, taped and attached to their frames. Bruce Seel, a Barre City resident, arrived in an Elvis costume. (“A lot of people call him a king, right?” he said.) 
Seel said he was attending Saturday’s protests in response to “Trump, this administration, and his authoritarian regime.” In Montpelier, he joined one large chapter of a nationwide day of “No Kings” protests. 
At noon, stretching down the Statehouse steps and across the lawn, a crowd of Vermonters gathered with signs, drums and costumes demonstrating displeasure with President Donald Trump’s administration.
Geri Peterson, an event organizer and leader of 50501 Vermont, estimated the crowd on Saturday could have been in excess of 10,000 people.
She said the event was about “defending our democracy” in general, but that at this particular rally, “we were choosing to center trans rights, which in particular have come under attack.”

Several speakers Saturday afternoon addressed the issue of trans rights, as well as health care  and the broader role of government, among other issues. U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt. and U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt. were among the event’s speakers.
“This is about to be the largest political gathering in America’s history,” said Balint in her remarks. “You’re out here because you wanna change the direction of the country.” It was not clear by Saturday afternoon whether the nationwide event had broken records.
Welch’s speech focused in part on the federal government’s shutdown.
“We do not want folks who are working hard to lose health care for themselves and their families,” he said. “We need less Trump and more Vermont values in Washington.”
Protest songs, including Ana Hernández’s “Set It Right Again,” punctuated Saturday’s event.

Howard Russell, 71, said he came to Montpelier from Hinesburg for more reasons than even a large sign could contain. Trump, he said, is “out of control.”
“Congress isn’t doing their job,” he added, and pleaded for democratic leaders to “hold the line” on health care premiums during the government’s shutdown.
Dan Thorington, of Williamstown, held a sign bearing the words “Veterans against Trump.” Having served in the U.S. military himself, he said the president’s rhetoric around veterans, as well as a number of his administration’s policies, were deeply troubling.
“We’re at a crisis,” Thorington said. “This is all I can think of at the moment, is to protest.”
Larz Allen, of Jeffersonville, said he attended Saturday’s rally with the role of money and big business in politics at the forefront of his mind.
“Citizens United is the problem,” Allen said, referring to the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned previous regulations on the role of corporations in political campaign finance. “I believe that a common person should be able to run for office.”
Allen also expressed concern with the federal government’s recent plans to expand public surveillance for immigration enforcement, saying that the country was veering closer to a “police state.”
At the foot of the lawn, a tent bearing the words “Pancakes for the People” was dispensing freshly griddled pancakes for protestors. Poa Mutino, of Barre City, said the organization had begun giving out free pancakes in front of Montpelier’s city hall six years ago.
The project, Mutino said, is “about bringing people together who wouldn’t normally eat together.” The event’s focus on trans rights had been important for the organization’s involvement, he added.
In an interview after her remarks, Balint said that the climate of fear infusing politics in Washington and beyond is “why we have to be out here today.”
“It gives me incredible hope to see not just the sheer number of people, but the different age groups…and that people understand that all hope is not lost,” Balint said.
Burlington
Hundreds of residents across the Queen City showed up with placards, costumes and crowns in a show of solidarity and whimsy. Events in Burlington included a bike ride, a honk and wave and three separate marches to City Hall by 11:30 a.m. Protests also took place in neighboring South Burlington, Winooski and Williston.
Jasmine Lamb, an organizer with Queen City Indivisible, estimated about 10,000 people attended. She led them in songs and chants, while a brass band inserted beats and tunes at the foot of the City Hall steps in the park downtown.

Unlike the June events, there were no speeches planned “to recognize that all of us are leaders in this moment,” Lamb said. 
The crowd sang songs like “We Shall Overcome” and “This Land is Your Land.” They chanted “this is what democracy looks like” and “hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go.”
Many residents held up signs protesting the Trump administration’s crackdown on marginalized communities, calling for the restoration of civil rights and to uphold civility and democracy.
Heidi Smith from South Burlington sported a unicorn headgear and a pink T-shirt with the words “Goodness Exists.”
“I’m here to stand up against Donald Trump  with others who feel the same way – and to do it with joy and love,” she said. “I’m trying to make a difference. It’s time to stand up and speak out.”
Jean Bluto from Winooski said she had to join the protest because she is upset about the cutbacks in federal funding affecting everything from food stamps to hospitals.
“If we were all silent we would still be flying the British flag,” she said, in a reference to colonialism.
University of Vermont student Quyn McCafferty, 22, said she saw first-hand the erosion of rights under the first Trump presidency — from the reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022 to the policing of protests in cities across the country. All of it makes “an unsafe environment for everyone,” she said.
“We just think a lot of things that Donald Trump stands for are things people are in opposition of,” said her friend Josh Hunt, 22, a recent graduate of UVM, who is particularly upset about cuts to education and scientific research.
They two sat on a wall at the edge of the park as the people dispersed from the protest, which lasted about two hours. They held two small white placards marked with black and red lettering: “Make fascists afraid again” and “Trump is dumb & stupid.”
Attendee Chelsea Alsofrom grew up in the Queen City, but her family emigrated from Eastern Europe.

She said her ancestors echoed what the person in front of them in line at Ellis Island said. That’s how she wound up with the last name Alsofrom. 
“We’re all immigrants,” she said Saturday in City Hall Park. Her two children, also in attendance, wore Spiderman costumes. She held a handmade sign that read ‘Trump, Spiderman is coming for you!’
Susan Caloggero joined the South End march that made its way down Charlotte Street at 11:20 a.m. She walked with her friends holding a sign that read ‘Without due process, it’s kidnapping.’
She was marching “for America, to stand up for people’s basic rights, no matter what background, what race,” she said. 
“We have long been a country that welcomed everybody,” said Caloggero, who recently visited Ellis Island for the first time and felt sad about the attitude and crackdown on immigration by the Trump administration. 
In the North End, Scott Patrick donned a large brown inflatable squirrel costume and waved to people gathering at Roosevelt Park at 10:30 a.m., in a nod to the recent protests in Portland, Oregon where residents wore animal costumes to defy Trump’s description of the city as a “war zone.”
“I love people protesting this way,” he said, adding that he is fed up with the Trump administration vilifying protestors and calling them names when they are all “just regular people.”
A self-described introvert, Patrick said he hasn’t participated in a protest since the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. He hoped to counteract a national climate of negativity and discord with tolerance and understanding by showing up to the march in a squirrel suit.
Later, in City Hall Park, he approached a pair dressed as yellow bananas, asking if they could point him to some acorns.
Brattleboro
In Brattleboro, several thousand people gathered at the Common to hear speeches by state officeholders who included local Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Vermont Treasurer Mike Pieciak, who encouraged his hometown to contribute to a new $1 million Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund to help asylum seekers and people facing deportation or detention.
“In this moment,” Pieciak said, “we need all of our elected leaders to stand up and clearly say what is right and what is wrong.”

The Brattleboro crowd saved its loudest applause for 19-year-old college student Django Grace, who called for everyone to unite regardless of political differences.
“So many of us have horrible disagreements with the ways that so many people think in this country and in this state and in this community,” Grace said. “We must end this internal war. We can no longer view fellow Americans as the enemy. We need common ground.”

During a speech delivered on the Idaho State Capitol steps, American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho board member Sam Linnet spoke out against what he said is a government that is using fear to divide the American people. 
Linnet called for transforming the political and economic systems of America and rejecting a system where he said billionaires buy elections and corporations write laws. Instead, Linnet called on the crowd to unite, hold the government accountable and support immigrants, women and trans people. 
“Everyone here proves democracy still has a pulse,” Linnet said. 
 Idahoans share why they participated in the No Kings rally in Boise

For Boisean Cyndee Pierce, Saturday’s No Kings rally was her first protest. She carried a homemade sign that read, “I’m not a paid protestor I hate facism for free.”

In an interview at the protest, Pierce said she chose to attend because she wanted to channel the anxiousness she is feeling about the government into something positive.
“I am extremely disappointed in our leaders,” Pierce said. “I am hoping against hope our leaders will try to represent all of us.”
Pierce said she was impressed by the large crowd, which covered the steps of the Idaho State Capitol, filled much of Jefferson Street  between Sixth and Eighth streets and took over much of nearby Cecil D. Andrus Park.
“In very red Idaho, having a crowd of any more than two people is encouraging,” Pierce said with a smile as she gestured toward the large crowd. 
Millie Watkins of Boise said Saturday’s No Kings protest at the Idaho State Capitol marked her fifth such recent protest. She said Saturday’s crowd was the largest she has ever seen. 
Watkins carried a handmade sign calling on the U.S. Congress to do its job.  
“I think (the size of the crowd) says that there are a lot of people in this country who disagree with what is going on,” Watkins said.

Saturday’s Boise No Kings protest coincided with hundreds of other No Kings protests held in cities across the country, States Newsroom reported.  
The Boise No Kings protest was organized by several groups including Idaho 50501, Indivisible and the American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho. Idaho 50501 is part of the wider 50501 movement, which originally got its name from 50 states, 50 protests, one movement. 
Saturday’s No Kings protests was the second large-scale No Kings protest in recent months in Boise. In June, thousands of people protested in front of the Idaho State Capitol during an earlier No Kings protest. 
“Our Founding Fathers rejected the idea of a monarchy for a reason,” Idaho 50501 spokesperson Sonya Christensen said in a written statement before the protest. “We say ‘No Kings’ because we believe in America’s founding principles. We are appalled at how our current Idaho representatives are abandoning those principles, and we are here to stand up for the Constitution of the United States of America.”

Demonstrators gathered Tuesday on what would have been Charlie Kirk’s birthday
Saturday’s No Kings protest wasn’t the only rally at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise this week.
On Tuesday, another group of demonstrators gathered at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise to honor conservative activist and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk on what would have been his 32nd birthday.
Organizers of the event, dubbed the God’s Country March, said the gathering would be the inaugural march and that they hope to hold an event in Kirk’s honor each year. 
Kirk was shot and killed while speaking Sept. 10 at an outdoor event at Utah Valley University in Orem.
“We are here for multiple reasons, God glorifying reasons, to be united as a singular people under one confession of Christ and Him crucified,” said Pastor Mike Lewis. “But also to remember the life of Charlie Kirk whose birthday it would be. We must remember where we are and remember who we are.”
Just hours before the Tuesday gathering, U.S. President Donald Trump posthumously awarded Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest honor for a civilian, at a ceremony at the White House.
Organizers and supporters of the march included the Old State Saloon, Idaho Liberty Dogs, Soldiers of the Cross, Turning Point USA and the Idaho Freedom Foundation.

Kirk was born Oct. 14, 1993, and the gathering was planned to honor Kirk’s birthday.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Organizers and politicians urged the crowd of more than 1,000, gathered Saturday at the Iowa State Capitol as part of the national No Kings protest, to stay engaged and help flip Iowa seats in the 2026 election.
The Des Moines event was one of more than 2,600 nonviolent demonstrations planned nationwide, with millions of participants protesting Trump administration actions on issues from cutting funding for public health programs, deploying National Guard troops to cities and mass deportations. It was the second No Kings national protest – the first was held in June in response to Donald Trump’s birthday military parade.
At the event, state lawmakers, union organizers, immigrant advocates and teachers decried Trump’s and Republicans’ policies. Speakers also emphasized Iowa will play a vital role in putting a check on Trump’s power in the 2026 election, and encouraged Iowans to vote and stay politically engaged.

Mike Draper, founder and owner of Raygun, a liberal-leaning shirt and souvenir business headquartered in Des Moines, told the crowd he invited U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn to a town hall Friday, but held up an empty chair with the sign with the sign “Representative Nunn” to show the Iowa 3rd District representative’s response. He criticized Nunn for not holding public town halls and said the Republican “doesn’t work for us,” but for Trump’s agenda.
He told the crowd that if Democrats win three seats in the U.S. House, there will be an effective “check on Trump’s power.”
“And as fate would have it, there are three competitive races in Iowa right now,” Draper said. “If we flip those three seats — all of which have been Democratic at some point in the last decade — Iowa alone will win the House of Representatives.”
In addition to the 3rd District, which is expected to be competitive, the congressional races for Iowa’s 1st and 2nd Districts are also expected to be more competitive than in previous election cycles. All four of Iowa’s congressional seats are currently held by Republicans.
While larger political topics like the federal government shutdown and release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein came up, some speakers said Trump’s trade policies have hurt Iowa in a unique way. Aaron Lehman, president of the Iowa Farmers Union and a farmer from Polk County, said Trump’s tariffs and recent federal trade policies have hurt Iowa farmers, pointing to China’s move to buy soybeans from South American producers instead of American farmers.

“I’m telling you, thousands and thousands of Iowa farmers are on the brink of a crisis,” he said. “Chaotic tariffs have devastated the markets for what we grow, and they have raised the cost of our inputs, and they have gotten us no closer to fair trade for farmers and workers.”
Elena Casillas-Hoffman, a communications specialist with Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, said Trump’s immigration policies are also negatively impacting Iowa. She said the only population growth Iowa has seen in recent years is because of immigrants and refugees, who are “revitalizing our communities.”
Members of these Iowa communities are now being detained by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, Casillas-Hoffman said. ICE has had a presence in Iowa for years, she said, but since Trump took office, immigration authorities’ tactics have changed, with more individuals being detained and arrested.
“We know that ICE is in six county jails.” Casillas-Hoffman said. “… We know that children are scared to go to school, to leave their homes. People are afraid to be a part of our community if they do not have their paperwork on them at all times. Our communities are beyond terrified, and we should not accept these conditions.”

Some speakers also hit on more local issues, like the campaign to form a nurses’ union at UnityPoint hospitals in Des Moines. One of the nurses involved in the organizing effort, Gail Grimes, spoke about the effort to form a union through Teamsters Local 90 – and how the scheduled unionization vote in early October was delayed indefinitely due to the federal shutdown.
“We will stay strong, and we will stay resolute that the nurses of Des Moines will respond with a resounding ‘yes’ when asked the most important of questions when the federal government reopens and a new election date set,” she said.
Grimes asked for protesters to support the unionization effort, linking it with the larger movement to support health care access and working Iowans.
“The only way the working class can win against the tyrannical shift happening in our beloved nation is through numbers and through our solidarity,” Grimes said.
Protesters came to the event dressed in costumes parodying Trump and other historical figures, carrying American and Palestinian flags, and holding up signs calling for political action.
Toby Kalage, a 19-year-old, carried a sign stating, “I am not the enemy, they are.” Kalage said that as a queer person of color, who recently exited the foster care system, they have been targeted by GOP policies.

Kalage said the protest made them feeling hopeful for Democrats chances in Iowa and nationwide in 2026 and future years.
“I came down because I wanted to be another person who was here, and having that effort made,” Kalage said. “And that adds up, for everyone who showed up here … It’s the same for voting.”
Georgia Rains Traviss, an Urbandale resident, said she was happy to have celebrated her 66th birthday at the No Kings event. She said it was important to have spaces where people can voice their disagreements and opinions without attacking others or engaging in violence.
Rains Traviss also said the event went smoothly as there were not altercations with police, military members or ICE agents, who have been present at some earlier protests in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago.
“I had some friends that were like, ‘Oh, aren’t you worried about (your safety) going down there? Aren’t you scared?'” she said. “But that’s what they want. They’ve been building up fear, they don’t want us to feel like we can come out here. I said, ‘You know, if you’re afraid, that’s what they want.’ … The worst thing you could ever do, is not go, because that’s what they want.”

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-CT, told a crowd in Hartford that he would continue to “stand up for health care” and that Democrats would not “back down” and be “intimidated” or “bullied” by Republicans. 
U.S. Rep. John Larson, D-1st District, condemned the actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Connecticut towns. 
“We do not consent to pulling mothers from their children in Newington and in Southington. We stood up and fight against them, because we’re Americans. Because this is the nation that we love,” Larson told the crowd in Hartford.

Immigration detentions and deportations have spiked since Trump took office in January. The administration has paused funding for refugee resettlement programs, and Trump has also expanded the number of immigrant detention centers across the U.S. 
The number of immigrants in the U.S. declined by 1.2 million between January and September of this year. In Connecticut, where ICE arrests have more than doubled from January through July of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, there have been reports of immigrants being detained at courthouses and car washes.
The “No Kings” protests, organized by a coalition of primarily liberal groups including the 50501 Movement, Indivisible and the ACLU, were set to take place in about 40 towns across Connecticut. These demonstrations follow similar “No Kings” protests in June, which drew thousands of protestors in response to a military parade organized in Washington D.C. 
According to the No Kings website, the protests are motivated by the increased actions from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to detain and deport immigrants with irregular status, cuts to healthcare and education spending, the rolling back of environmental regulations and voting redistricting in states like Texas that are meant to favor Republican lawmakers and candidates.  
“The president thinks his rule is absolute. But in America, we don’t have kings and we won’t back down against chaos, corruption, and cruelty,” the website reads.  
In New Haven, protestors filled the New Haven Green, carrying signs, wearing costumes and waving American flags.
Gayathri Vijayakumar, 46, said she works for a sustainability company, and says climate change is the biggest issue that drew her to protest.
“For me, it’s all about the sustainability of our environment. He set us so far back by slashing the budget that Biden had put in place,” she said. “It was going to be phenomenal, phenomenal for the efficiency of buildings. We’re so far behind as it is, this is undoing decades of progress.”
But it’s not her only concern.
“I ride the train with my passport now,” she said.
On the outskirts of the green, a group of women with umbrellas painted with words like “No Kings” and “Persist, Resist, Insist” stood in a line. Tina Santoni, 67, said she started workshops for women, teaching them to paint the umbrellas. They’ve grown to about 40 people in total.
“ I had one at the last No Kings March. But after that I started getting, making, creating workshops for people to come and make them. We’re all women,” she said, adding that a few weeks ago, she’d led a group of the women on a walk in downtown New Haven.
“We walk in silence. We let our umbrellas speak for us. We try to put messages on our umbrellas that we really feel strongly about,” she said.
26-year-old Maisy Crews said that as a healthcare provider, she was concerned about the inability to provide healthcare for her patients, particularly as someone who works in addiction medicine.
Several people also talked about the division within the country,
“ Most people are using really controversial issues as a place to divide us, like trans issues and abortion and things like that,” said Victoria Atkin-Dahm, a Guilford resident and student at Southern Connecticut State University. “Their main goal is to divide us so that they can control us, in my opinion. And I think this is the time that we all need to gather and be together like this.
31-year-old Sam Meskill said his biggest concern was ICE detaining immigrants.
“Watching the videos on that is really disturbing,” he said.
77-year-old Carmen Mahone of Branford said she disliked the anger and hatred that she saw, and the way that Trump treated those around him, referring to him as a “lunatic.” She also talked about the need for affordable health care.
“I’m retired and I got a pension plus Medicare. So I’m gifted, but the people that don’t — it’s unconscionable to see people just lose their lives because they can’t get a certain drug anymore,” she said.
75-year-old Susan White of Southbury said she was concerned about benefits for retired people.
“We worked our whole lives so that we’d be safe at this point through Medicare and social security. And if he screws with that, there’s going to be a revolt of old people. And really, what do we have to lose at this point for standing up? Nothing.
State lawmakers Martin Looney and Gary Winfield, both New Haven Democrats, told the crowd that the state legislature needed to step up in light of the federal government’s actions. Looney said he wanted the state legislature to do more to address federal actions.
He said he wanted to see a law passed that would prohibit ICE agents in Connecticut from wearing masks and require them to have body cameras. He said the General assembly planned to return to the Capitol in November to try and use state dollars to fill in places that the federal government had made cuts.
“I’m committed that we will maximize that to the extent we can,” said Looney.

Similar scenes played out across Connecticut. 
In Westport, crowds gathered around Jesup Green and the Westport Library.
“We’re here for humanity, for our decency, and for Mother Earth,” said Maureen Maloney of Fairfield. “We’ve got to take care of her.”
“My passion started back during the Vietnam protests, and I’ve just kept going,” said Donna Kraisman. “It comes from loving our country. That’s where my passion comes from.”
Maloney, an immigrant from Ireland, said her motivation comes from seeing the country change over the years.
“I immigrated here 32 years ago,” she said. “I chose to come to America because of opportunity. I’ve worked hard all my life, but those chances are disappearing. That’s why I’m here.”

“I’m here because I believe in the principle. This is democracy,” said Bernard Perry, a 95-year-old Westport resident. “That’s what I was brought into when I was born.”
He said the health of democracy depends on those in power.
“It’s all about leadership and how that leadership views the Constitution,” Perry said. “Right now, the leadership has really thrown out the Constitution. That’s why we’re in this mess.”
David Brigg Jr. of Bridgeport said he has deep concerns about the state of the country and is particularly critical of the Supreme Court.
“With the Supreme Court backing Trump and giving him full immunity, he could do anything he wants,” he said.
But Brigg said he still encourages civic engagement, emphasizing the importance of voting and political participation.

Michael Greenberg, a 78-year-old Westport resident who said he once met Martin Luther King Jr., emphasized the importance of speaking up against threats to democracy. 
But, he said, the younger generations can drive meaningful change and continue the fight for justice.
“It’s the young ones,” he said. “They’re holding the torch, and they’re the future, and that’s what we’re fighting for.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1018_SR_NoKings_066-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-18 17:02:53.464059

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Floridians massed throughout the state Saturday for the second national No Kings day demonstrations against the increasingly authoritarian second Trump administration, marked as it is by aggressive immigration enforcement and prosecutions of the president’s enemies.
Events has been planned in nearly 100 Florida cities and towns, according to organizers.
In Miami, an estimated 5,000 people clad in American flags, golden crowns, and frog and Sasquatch costumes flooded Bayfront Park to chant against Trump.
The event, which saw thousands of global demonstrations, drew Miamians of every age. It was held in front of the Torch of Friendship, a 1960 monument built as a beacon to welcome immigrants.
One disruption hit the Miami gathering when Barry Ramey and another member of the white nationalist group the Proud Boys briefly showed up to counter-protest. Ramey was one of the men sentenced for rioting at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. City police quickly formed an escort to safely lead them out, as angry anti-Trump protesters screamed Spanish expletives at them. 
In Tallahassee, a lively crowd packed the lawn in front of the Old Capitol and both sides of Monroe Street, waving signs at passing cars; many of their drivers honked their horns in solidarity. 
A crowd estimated to be several thousand strong gathered along the four street corners in the Tyrone Square area of St. Petersburg. A Pinellas County teacher who wanted to be identified only by her first name of Marissa wore a cape of the American flag.
“I’m pretty worried that we’re losing our democracy, and I think we’re losing our way as Americans,” she said. 










I know the Republicans have talked about how we hate America. No, I love my country, and I hate what you are doing to it, Donald Trump.


“I feel like the actions that the Trump administration is taking doesn’t represent our country or what our founders had as a vision for our country. And so I’m here today because of that. I love my country. I’m wearing a flag today because I want us to take back flags. I know the Republicans have talked about how we hate America. No, I love my country, and I hate what you are doing to it, Donald Trump.”
Approximately 2,000 gathered in Gainesville on the same day as University of Florida’s homecoming football game. They listened to poems, songs, and calls to action. A Phoenix reporter noticed no counter-protesters or any police.
In Sopchoppy, a small Wakulla County town 35 miles south of Tallahassee, a rally attracted around 30 people.The county is solidly Republican, with Trump winning nearly 72% of the vote in 2024. Gov. Ron DeSantis took 73% of the vote during his 2022 re-election bid.
Despite a small crowd, there was a heavy county sheriff’s presence — at least seven deputies to oversee the demonstrators and no more than 10 counterprotestors.
The protests took place as the federal government shutdown is now in its third week. The dispute revolves around Democrats pushing Republicans to reinstate the enhanced premium tax subsidies for those on the Affordable Care Act scheduled to expire at the end of this year. 
“When Marjorie Taylor Greene starts becoming progressive, we know the GOP has screwed up,” said St. Petersburg resident Gregory Mann, referring to the Georgia Republican’s comments last week that she would go “against everyone on this issue” because the premium hikes would harm “my own adult children” and her constituents in northwest Georgia.

Hitler, Castro
Back in Miami, complaints ranged from mild criticisms of Trump to outright comparisons to Adolf Hitler and Fidel Castro, the long-reigning Cuban dictator whose revolution forced an exodus of millions of Cubans over decades to leave the island nation.
Many ended up in Miami. One is Jorge Cardelle, a 67-year-old Cuban-born U.S. veteran who served four years in the Navy and 16 in the Army.
“I’m here to protest how our government is being run. The abuses, the corruption — I was born in Cuba, and my parents left because of the corruption. What happened there is what’s happening here,” said Cardelle, wrapped in an American flag in front of a towering Ponce De Leon statue.
Other protesters who spoke to the Phoenix included a University of Miami law professor dressed as a frog, a grocer adorned in that Sasquatch costume, a 25-year-old artist, two retired nurses, the president of the University of Miami’s UDems, and a mayoral candidate running as a socialist. 
Their beliefs ran along the same lines. 
“He’s breaking my heart,” said Caroline Mala Corbin, the 57-year-old constitutional law professor at the nearby University of Miami.

“This is Hitler!” said Karen, a 72-year-old retired nurse. A Cuban-born Gen Z artist named Gamal echoed this in a portrait he hastily made the night before. Titled “Ice King,” it depicts a frozen Trump wearing a golden crown, with the Nazi SS symbol to his left.
“I wanted to make sure that the ice kind of resembles the SS symbol from the Nazis because we think he has kind of the same movement, going with the way that it’s going too far to the right,” the 25-year-old said. 
Music played throughout from a booming speaker at the feet of the ever-burning Torch of Friendship, where many danced, sang, chanted, and even played guitar.

‘It feels like you’re not alone’
One attendee in St. Pete was Pinellas Park resident Rachel Parker, a U.S. Army Veteran who says she’s working without pay as a veterans services representative at the VA because of the shutdown. She was dismissive of Republican contentions that protesters are anti-American.
“All of these Republican leaders like [Senate Majority Leader] John Thune coming out and saying ‘This is a protest of hate,’” she said. “It’s not a protest of hate. We are just utilizing our First Amendment rights to talk about the things that we have no control over. If Congress wants to abdicate all of its responsibilities right now, then we’re going to have to do it for them.”
A Pinellas County teacher who wanted to be identified only by her first name, Marissa, wore a cape of the American flag.
“I’m pretty worried that we’re losing our democracy, and I think we’re losing our way as Americans,” she said. “I feel like the actions that the Trump administration is taking doesn’t represent our country or what our founders had as a vision for our country. And so I’m here today because of that. I love my country. I’m wearing a flag today because I want us to take back flags. I know the Republicans have talked about how we hate America. No, I love my country, and I hate what you are doing to it, Donald Trump.”
Kay, a Jacksonville teacher who didn’t want to disclose her last name, was delighted to be among so many fellow Floridians speaking out against the Trump agenda.
“It feels like you’re not alone,” she said. “Because in the neighborhood that I live in, I feel like I’m a minority. And I feel like I can’t be openly against Trump and the administration. But being here makes me feel a lot more comfortable. And I feel like I have a community where there is still hope.”

‘Very excited, peaceful crowd’
In Gainesville, William Marquardt, a retired archaeologist, said he was reusing his sign from the first No Kings day protests. “I hope it will be obsolete one day.” But, he added, “probably not in my lifetime.”
“This turnout is going to be bigger today across the country. Not just Washington or Chicago, but every place, small towns. I think people are finally realizing, if you don’t stand up and say something, you’ve lost your chance,” Marquardt told the Phoenix. 
Signs at the event at Gainesville’s Cora Roberson Park pointed out Trump’s association with Jeffrey Epstein, condemned fascism, advocated for protecting democracy, and of course, displeasure with Trump and his administration.
Various organizations used the event to provide outreach, such as the Alachua Democrats, the Sierra Club, Badass Feminists of Gainesville, and Gainesville Women for Democracy.
No Kings in north Florida
In Tallahassee, compared to the last No Kings rally in June, this one was “twice the size, said Ellen Davis, attending with a friend who identified herself as Sharon Z. (Police estimated the earlier turnout at 2,000 people – organizers claimed 5,000.)

They sat in lawn chairs with an American flag, flying upside down to signal distress, upon which was written, “The Power of the People is > Than the People in Power.”
Susan Amore, wearing a vest identifying herself as an ACLU legal monitor, described the vibe as “a very excited, peaceful crowd.”
“Make Orwell and Atwell fiction again,” one sign read. Overheard in passing: “My dog’s an idiot. She’s also smarter than Trump.”
No obvious police presence was apparent.
On the other hand, No Kings Sopchoppy event organizer Robert Seidler had reached out to the sheriff’s office after some inflammatory comments were posted about it on a Facebook page. But there were no altercations throughout the three-hour event, which featured protest songs on the banjo, including “This Land is Your Land.” 
 Lt. Will Hudson of the Wakulla County Sheriff’s Office confirmed Seidler’s comments. “And we actually took a proactive approach to it, as well. And just anything that’s going to happen in Wakulla, the sheriff’s office is going to make sure that the safety and security of the people at the event, that it’s taken care of.”
Sue Wallrich told the Florida Phoenix, “I know my neighbors. I’ve lived here for a long time. We all agree behind closed doors. But then, the second, you know, you gotta flash something on Facebook and our algorithms blow up. I think it’s really screwing us all over; like, we are more alike than we think.”
Counter-protester “Wolf” wasn’t aware of the flare-up on social media; he said he heard about the gathering at church and decided to attend. He grabbed his Make America Great Again hat before he left the house, he acknowledged, to “attract some attention.”
“To me it’s dumb because we don’t have kings. They are misguided people. They probably mean well. Most of them mean well, but they are misguided. I came here to say a couple of prayers.”

Marchers chanted a variety of messages as they made their way across the Plaza, including: “No Kings/No ICE” and “This is what democracy looks like.” One man played the David Bowie/Queen song “Under Pressure” repeatedly from a small speaker.

Organizers for Indivisible Santa Fe, one of thousands of chapters formed nationally to oppose President Donald Trump during his first term, estimated that twice as many people showed up Saturday as did in June for the first No Kings protest. They said it shows momentum building against Trump and what they called his authoritarian administration. 
“They work for us, and they need to listen to us,” said Indivisible organizer David Bazell in a brief speech to hundreds gathered. “Our power is much stronger than anybody in this administration.”

The protest featured dozens of people in inflatable costumes—sharks, bees, unicorns, aliens and more—in solidarity to common protest attire Portland protesters have been wearing in demonstrations against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Trump has threatened to deploy the National Guard to tamp down on “antifa militants” there. 
“We’re wearing inflatable costumes because we want to support and enhance  what’s happening in Portland and I’m sure everywhere,” Breece Robertson told Source. “We want to just show that we are peaceful, we are loving and we really care about our democracies, so we’re not a threat. We are standing up for our rights in this country.”

In Santa Fe, many protesters embraced the “anti-fascist” label in signs and chants. “My dad was Antifa in WWII. I am Antifa now” one sign read. Sharon Argenbright, a nurse for 40 years, drew laughs when she introduced herself to the crowd with a curtsy and said, “Hi. This is Antifa, also known as Sharon.”
“I’m a nurse and I care about people,” she said. “We just need to keep doing this. The house of cards is coming down.”

Chris and Sallee Wiseman, also of Santa Fe, donned king and queen costumes. They said Trump’s assault on democracy in numerous forms, along with his seeming indifference to the struggles of working people, compelled them to join thousands of their neighbors Saturday in front of the Roundhouse. 
“I absolutely oppose 99.9% of his policies,” Chris told Source New Mexico, listing off Trump’s mass deportation push, the rising cost of food and health insurance, threats to health care for millions of Americans and Trump’s “re-vengeance” campaign against political enemies.

“We just can’t stand what’s happening,” Sallee added as she and her husband took shade under a tree in the Roundhouse courtyard. 
Former Santa Fe City Councilor Ron Trujillo, currently a candidate in the city’s upcoming mayoral election, said he was heartened to see the thousands of people who turned out for the protest.
“People need to come out, stand up for what they believe is right,” Trujillo told Source NM. “This federal government that’s that’s telling us what they they think is best for us, this isn’t the America we live in.  It’s about the democracy.”

As they have previously, members of Danza Tonantzin de Analco showed up to perform a ceremonial blessing for the event, and were accompanied by Kathy Wan Povi Sanchez (San Ildefonso Pueblo), one of the founders of Tewa Women United.

“It was very, very humbling and honoring for me to be here to acknowledge our ancestors and the connectivity between all the people that are here,” Sanchez told Source. “Because they’re coming from all four directions, like the blessing for the directions calling into energy and the spirit. And we are all energy beings of caring and within us our love, the multi-versal infinity of loving, caring, sharing. So it was important for me to convey my gratitude for each and everyone that is here, young and old and first-timers. Just knowing that we don’t have to carry the anger or the grief and that we can heal immediately from all those that have been put here to keep us oppressed. Breaking the silence, it is very, very empowering for all people here to continue to be blessed in that way.”
Zoey Craft from Youth United for Climate Crisis Action, spoke to the crowd from a stage at the Roundhouse, and urged attendees to take even more action.

“What we’re witnessing isn’t the system breaking or democracy dying,” Craft said. “It’s the illusion fading. It’s an empire built on stolen land and labor extraction and white supremacy revealing itself for what it’s always been. And if that’s what we’re up against, then it’s not enough to just be outraged. We have to be organized, because young people and frontline communities don’t need more allies in name. We need co-conspirators in action.”
In Albuquerque, more than 5,000 people took to the streets in a march that nearly encircled the city’s downtown core.
Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller and House Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque) were among the attendees.
Keller said the city continues to oppose the Trump Administration, telling Source NM that Albuquerque is committed to being “a family-friendly city that fights for immigrant rights.”

“Most recently, we’re working with Chicago and Portland on the legal side to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to be ready and prepared should the [national guard] show up here,” he said. 
Martínez, holding a “No kings, no crowns, we don’t kneel down,” sign, told Source NM that the march “filled his heart,” and was energizing democracy. “The cruelty of the federal government, what they’re seeking to do is to strip us of our humanity, of our compassion, of our sense of ownership of this process and system,” he said.

A menagerie of inflatable costumes also speckled the Albuquerque protest, as people carried signs with slogans such as “Democracy Dies in Silence,” “Only you can prevent fascism” alongside Smokey Bear’s image and “No Trump, No ICE, No Troops.” 
“The best approach to undercutting tyranny is satire and mockery,”’ Paul Szauter, 70, bedecked as an inflatable chicken, told Source NM Saturday morning, after clucking like a chicken.

Szauter said he felt the need to march because he is a “first-generation American and birthright citizen,” and said he needed to protest the administration’s immigration policies, which he called “cruel.” 
Lily Jensen, 27, and her mother, Amberlyn Lopez, 46, said the event was their first-ever participation in a protest or march, saying that while they previously volunteered with their communities, or called elected officials, they felt compelled to do more. 
“It just felt like everything I was doing wasn’t enough,” Jensen, a health care educator, told Source NM. “I need other states to see that everyone here has the same message: We don’t accept a king.”
Lopez added that she’s concerned about a slide into autocracy, saying: “It’s important that we use our voice, while we still can.” 
James Bourguet, 22, was one of the younger participants in a crowd that skewed older. When asked for his reasons for protesting, Bourguet responded “there weren’t enough words.”
“It’s a Watergate everyday, and these are the people that actually want to do something about it,” he said, gesturing to the crowd.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Exactly 250 years to the day after the British attacked what is now Portland, Maine, during the Revolutionary War, thousands gathered in the city and across the state to declare the same thing Americans had been fighting for then: no kings. 
This was the overarching rallying cry of the more than 30 demonstrations across the state and more than 2,600 across the country known as No Kings day in response to what a broad coalition of liberal advocacy organizations say is “the increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration, which they have doubled down on since June.”   
Saturday marked the second nationwide protest organized under this name. The first, on June 14, coincided with President Donald Trump’s massive military parade on his 79th birthday. This time the demonstrations occurred against the backdrop of a federal government shutdown with no end in sight and as Trump threatens to deploy more federal troops on American cities. 
In Portland, participation nearly doubled, with 3,000 turning out in April and nearly 6,000 on Saturday. New attendees said they decided to show up because they feel the country has reached an untenable state, but speeches at the protests showed continued hope for change.   
Wearing a t-shirt that read “Facism is bad -history,” Katya Fromuth, a high school senior from Yarmouth, told the crowd gathered in Portland’s Deering Oaks Park that she started a youth organizing effort yesterday from her kitchen.
It’s called the Franklin Project, named after Ben Franklin’s reply when asked if the country was a republic or a monarchy: “A democracy — if you can keep it.”

What Mainers are saying 
Many participants said this type of demonstration was important to help them not feel alone in their fear and anger. 
“I think protesting is one very important part of that resistance because it’s visible,” said Madeline Jones of Portland, “and because so much of what Trump is doing to us feels so isolating.” 
Others said this form of political action is helpful — even to those who don’t attend. 
Erin Houghton of Cumberland, 48, and her daughter Penny Houghton, 15, attended the Portland protest together.
“I think we have a lot of privilege, which makes it even more important that we stand up and stand out publicly for other people who may not be able to,” Erin Houghton said, “and that includes people with disabilities, for whom there are major barriers to standing up at a protest, literally and figuratively, as well as people who could be taken [by immigration authorities].” 
Linda Davis, who was visiting Portland from Boston, said attending a protest is a relatively easy, low-lift effort, “but then it gives other people who are maybe more willing to do the scary things,” such as higher education institutions refusing to comply with executive overreach, “it gives them that that support to do that.” 
Many had concerns about the future of education.
Holding an American flag and wearing a shirt that read “protect banned books,” Dawnelle Sullivan, who traveled from Monmouth for Portland’s protest, works in special education and is concerned about the Trump administration’s attempt to gut the special education office. “I need to protect those kids,” she said.
Ann Weber of Portland, sporting a Columbia University hat and Harvard sweatshirt, said she’s concerned about the future of higher education. 
Her youngest son attends Harvard and her older son attends Columbia, both institutions Trump has battled. And her other son works as a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, awaiting federal funding for cancer research, which overall has seen cuts under the Trump administration. 
Her husband Bill Weber, who worked as an environmental engineer for 43 years, is part of a group trying to establish a climate action plan in Portland. He said, “I’m afraid municipal leaders will use Trump as an excuse to not do anything.”
An anti-ICE message
The Trump administration’s immigration policies were a focus for many at the first No Kings day in June and again on Saturday, as sweeping and aggressive immigration raids continue. 
Vanessa, who declined to share her last name, is a teacher at Portland High School. She was brought to tears when explaining how she and her colleagues have had to think about how to protect their students if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents ever enter their school. In September, a parent was detained by ICE after dropping off their child at a Portland elementary school. 
As participants and speakers in Portland raised alarm about ICE raids, others gathered in Wells outside the town’s police station for a recurring protest of their local authorities’ agreement with federal immigration officials.

“I am hopeful that the many standouts in small towns and larger cities will show that there is strong resistance across Maine and across the country to the current policies of the current administration,” said Peg Duddy, who attended the protest in Wells and is a part of the core group that’s been calling for an end to the contract. “We are standing together to help save our democracy.” 
Wells Police Department remains the only agency in the state to enter an agreement under the 287(g) program, which permits local officers to arrest people on immigration violations, an authority otherwise reserved for federal agents. The department is continuing what Police Chief JoAnn Putnam has described as a “wait-and-see approach” to credentialing its officers under the program in light of the pending state legislation that would ban such agreements. 
In Bangor, where roughly 2,000 people gathered Saturday, state Rep. Amy Roeder called on Gov. Janet Mills to sign that legislation and urged all Mainers to not accept the Trump administration’s immigration policies as the status quo. 
“Don’t sleep while democracy dies,” Roeder said.
 Local and national candidates stand out

Speaking in Portland, Democratic U.S. Rep. Chelli Pingree of Maine condemned recent comments made by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, who said No Kings day was a “hate America rally.”  
Pingree told the crowd they’re doing the most American of things: protesting the government. 
She encouraged continued protesting but said only Congress, by taking back the power of the purse, can stop the illegal actions of the president. 
“In November 2026,” Pingree said, “we need a brand new Congress.”
The demonstration in Portland featured speeches from numerous candidates for local and federal offices, including several Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate — David Costello, Jordan Wood, Tucker Favreau — who showed a united front in saying they’re running to stop Trump’s assault on democracy, though each pitching themselves as the best fit for the job.  
Gubernatorial candidates also took the stage, including Hannah Pingree, daughter of Chelli Pingree. She said, “Governors are really leading the way.”
Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a candidate for governor, spoke about when she removed Trump from the ballot in 2023 after a citizen challenged his candidacy under the U.S. Constitution because of his involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. 
“Doing the right thing even when it is hard is what we must do,” Bellows said, “and this is the secret of righteous resistance.” 
More recently, Bellows twice refused to share sensitive voter information with the Trump administration and was sued over it. 
“What I’ve learned unfortunately over the years is that lack of courage is contagious,” Bellows said. “Someone makes a decision based on fear, they get rewarded for it. Another person or institution catches the disease. But here’s another secret: courage is contagious.” 
The two statewide referendums were also highlighted in speeches, with proponents calling for attendees to vote yes on Question 2 (to create a red flag law) and opponents of Question 1 (which seeks to make changes to election procedures) urging people to vote no.

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A thick sea of Hoosiers flooded the Indiana Statehouse’s lawn for hours on Saturday — raising defiant fists and signs as they protested President Donald Trump’s administration.
It was one of about 40 No Kings demonstrations around the state, and one of 2,600 scheduled around the country that organizers said drew millions collectively. The Indianapolis crowd was several thousand and organizers in Fort Wayne said 8,000 attended.
Protesters are “not subjects” or “pawns,” but are citizens and voters, said Danielle Drake, advocacy manager for the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana.
“We gather not in despair, but in defiance,” she said. “… knowing that together, we can and will hold this unkempt power accountable! We will hold the line.”
Story continues below.































































































Several speakers denounced the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.
“We cannot let anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies tear apart the two fabric of our nation, because who are we? We are a nation of immigrants!” shouted the Rev. Felipe Martinez of Columbus Community United Church.
Others targeted Indiana Gov. Mike Braun — along with Republican supermajorities in the state’s House and Senate — who are considering redrawing congressional maps early.
“We might be called back into special session, and if they do (that), I hope that we translate our feelings, our energy, our emotions in action,” called Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis.
He pushed the crowd to call their lawmakers.
“If they cheat and they succeed, what does that mean to you and to Hoosiers across Indiana? It means that they will cement their agenda of cutting Medicaid, of cutting funding for (child care assistance), of shifting wealth and helping with tax cuts for the most ultra-wealthy in our nation,” Qaddoura added, unleashing a chorus of booing from the crowd.
Some critiqued Braun’s overhaul of Indiana University’s board of trustees, the university’s tussle with its own student newspaper, statewide degree program cuts and a crackdown on outspoken state and public education staffers.
Suzanne Swierc, a Ball State University employee who lost her job after she posted about the late conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, emphasized the importance of free speech.

Swierc, who is suing her former employer, said she encountered social media comments saying that freedom of speech doesn’t mean freedom from consequences.
“What happened to me has happened and is happening to so many others,” Swierc told the crowd. “There are so many people across our state and our country who are hesitant to speak up, whose speech is being chilled, and that is not okay.
“We should be able to freely express ourselves. We should be able to point out injustices against ourselves and our neighbors. We should be able to advocate for the good of others, and we should be able to do all of this without the government affecting what we can and cannot say,” she added.
Protesters at the Statehouse’s southern steps repeatedly clashed with a Trump supporter wearing a red “Make America Great Again” cap and toting a 2024 campaign sign — even as demonstrators warned each other not to engage with him.
After a shouting match with a blue-vested event security official, an Indiana State Police officer took the man aside for several minutes, before letting him back into the crowd.
Protesters wedged their own signs around his, following his movements. The man, who identified himself only as Hugh, told reporters, “I’m just here to exercise my rights, just like everybody else.”
Attendees chanted and clapped their way through hours of speeches, poems and prayers before flowing out of the lawn to march around the Statehouse.
Families gather outside Indianapolis
Several hundred protesters ringed the Boone County Courthouse Saturday afternoon. They marched, chanted, listened to speakers and broke into cheers every time a passing car honked in approval.

“No hate. No fear. Everyone is welcome here,” they chanted, along with, “This is what democracy looks like.”
Among the issues the crowd focused on was deportation policy, health care cuts and the belief that Trump is an authoritarian.
Cathy VanArsdall said she hasn’t attended a protest since the 1970s but wanted to come out Saturday so that others in the community know they aren’t alone and can speak up.
“We want to show that we do not believe in what’s happening right now,” VanArsdall, a Lebanon resident, said. She accused federal officials of “abducting” people from the streets, violating the U.S. Constitution and lying to the American public.
Melissa, Mike and Liam McMann from Fishers also came to the rally and held signs.
“I came out for my son’s future,” Melissa McMann said. “His rights and liberties and his classmates’ are in jeopardy.”
Liam McMann, 14, said he wants a stable government and to end Trump’s tyranny.
His father, Mike McMann, said, “I served in the Army and this is not what I served for.”
No police were at the event.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Thousands of Virginians gathered at Capitol Square in Richmond, in the shadow of statues of the nation’s founding fathers, to join a nationwide demonstration against President Donald Trump’s administration on Saturday. Organizers said over 10,000 people participated in the event, one of dozens in the state and hundreds across America that drew millions of attendees. 
Families of all ages and backgrounds held signs, donned costumes, and sang pro-America songs at the state Capitol before marching down Broad Street. Speakers from pro-democracy and civil rights organizations shared messages of resistance to the federal government upheaval that has come to define Trump’s second term. 
It was a seemingly peaceful demonstration, with no reported arrests or violence as of 4:30 p.m. Saturday when the event was set to disband.
Ahead of the march, Linda Wicks and Jaclyn White sat with their signs in the shade, having traveled from the city of Petersburg and Prince George County to voice their concerns about the country, which has become so polarized that eight in ten Americans “cannot agree on basic facts” about important issues facing the country, according to Pew Research Center polling published earlier this year.

“I am so worried about the direction that our country is taking and we need to stand up and let everyone know how wonderful this country is. We need to go back to decency and following the law,” Wicks said.
White’s sign read “America is a Democracy. No Kings since 1776,” while Wicks’ read “I’m here because I love America.” They were nervous about speaking with the media, the women said, due to the Trump administration’s censorship and targeting of progressive voices.
Giant letters placed at the steps of the state Capitol read “Tax the Rich” and thousands filled the surrounding area to hear speeches centered on education funding, the necessity of leaders abiding by the county’s laws, and federal targeting of immigrant communities. Some signs called for Trump’s impeachment.

Lindsey Dougherty, a Democrat vying to unseat Republican Del. Carrie Coyner for the second time in House District 75, also spoke at Saturday’s protest in Virginia’s capital city.

“Every event that I go to this year, the crowds have grown more and more. I think that is a really great opportunity for us to capitalize on our own community … because we serve communities, not kings,” said Dougherty, whose head-to-head contest with Coyner is considered one of the most competitive in this fall’s elections where all 100 House of Delegates seats are on the ballot.
A group of attendees who had also participated in the June No Kings rally in Richmond said public turnout at the October event was much higher.
Kevin Perry and his 12-year-old son Dezmond came from Dinwiddie to “fight authoritarianism.” Perry said Dezmond said in his small community it can be hard to find like-minded kids at his school. He finds connection with people online and at events like Saturday’s demonstration.

The fall wave of No King protests in Richmond and elsewhere in the nation came at the end of a second week of a government shutdown, as frustrations continue to mount due to federal worker furloughs, with some employees going weeks without paychecks. 
Richmond speakers also highlighted federal workers’ interrupted paychecks because of the shutdown, as well as the proposed cuts to Medicaid that have brought Congressional deliberations and federal government functioning to a standstill, and their fear of the rise of fascism.

Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson had called the planned protest a “Hate America rally,” claiming without proof it was organized by pro-Hamas and “antifa” groups. 
Deirdre Schiefeling, the Chief Political and Advocacy Officer for the ACLU, said in a press call ahead of the event that the rallies were about protecting free speech, putting a spotlight on the crackdown on immigration, and weighing in on lawmakers’ government funding discussions.
Several protesters at Richmond’s rally rebuked Johnson’s comments, saying that free speech is an integral part of America’s foundation.
“The entire American experience is based on protesting an oppressive government. So why is this un-American? There is no logic in that in any way, shape or form,” said Jason Erbe, of Richmond.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in a statement on X that “Virginians have a fundamental right to free speech and peaceful assembly, but that right does not include the destruction of property, looting, vandalism, disruption of traffic, or violence of any kind—for which there will be zero tolerance.”
The governor added that his administration was coordinating with local, state and federal law enforcement, and said he “authorized members of the National Guard to be placed in ‘state active duty’ status to ensure the Guard will be ready to respond alongside our substantially increased police presence to help keep Virginians safe.”

Capitol Police, the Richmond Police Department, and Virginia State Police officers were present at the Richmond rally, helping to direct traffic as protesters closed down both directions of Broad Street in downtown Richmond on their way to Monroe Park, where more speeches took place.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Granite Staters who took to the streets Oct. 18 in Concord said concerns about health care, immigration, racism, disability rights, free speech, and more motivated them to join that day’s No Kings protest.
The Concord demonstration was one of more than 30 official rallies organized across the state by the national coalition No Kings, and one of more than 2,700 planned across the nation. In the capital, the protest filled the State House lawn and spilled out along North Main Street.
“What’s going on in America is intolerable. This administration is trying to eliminate democracy,” said Donald Winchester, of Antrim. “Mayflower pilgrims were immigrants too,” read a sign he carried.
“I’m an eighth generation New Hampshire native. I was raised a Republican, fiscally conservative, socially responsible, protectors of the environment, party of Lincoln, and so now I’m a very active Democrat, because I am just beside myself with what’s going on,” said Meredith resident Sandy Mucci, who cited concerns about the “militarization” of American cities. (Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)
Sandy Mucci, of Meredith, said she was concerned about the administration’s use of the military and hoped the protest would help push more lawmakers to take action against what she said was executive branch overreach. 
“I’m an eighth generation New Hampshire native,” she said. “I was raised a Republican, fiscally conservative, socially responsible, protectors of the environment, party of Lincoln, and so now I’m a very active Democrat, because I am just beside myself with what’s going on,” she said. “… I am scared to death.”
Retired Air Force Master Sgt. Mike Scism, of Sanbornton, waved an American flag at passersby. The administration’s management of the military has disturbed him, Scism said.
“When you join (the military), you swear an oath to protect the Constitution, not to uphold a dictator. What (Secretary Pete) Hegseth is doing to the Department of Defense is horrible,” he said, referencing remarks Hegseth has made targeting diversity and equity initiatives in the military. “… Diversity and having people from all walks of life in the military is key to our strength. It’s not a weakness,” Scism said. 
He added that he believed more veterans were in attendance Oct. 18 than had been present at the first No Kings rally in June.
Chris Farrell, a protest organizer and military veteran, also spoke about the importance of diversity to the military. He led attendees in a recitation of the oath of enlistment, a version of which is taken by military and federal officials when they are sworn in to a role.
“I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America,” the oath began. “… As long as there are Americans willing to speak those words, there will be no kings in this nation,” Ferrell said after the oath had concluded.

Other speakers included disability rights advocate Lisa Beaudoin, who criticized federal funding cuts to the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services and health care, and called for more support and respect for disabled Americans. She also criticized New Hampshire Republicans in particular, who she said were “leading the nation in cuts to Medicaid.”
Bob Sanders, of Concord, who recently concluded a cross-country bike trip protesting the war in Gaza, also spoke at the event, calling for a lasting ceasefire. New Hampshire Youth Movement representative Ty Wyman called for more youth involvement in politics. Other speakers discussed topics from vaccines to health care and immigration.
In bright costumes and with signs bearing messages from lighthearted to urgent, protesters in Concord cheered, chanted, and waved at passing cars throughout the afternoon. A crew of 18 “peacekeepers” from New Hampshire Peace Action patrolled the crowd; the team is trained in deescalation, said peacekeeper Lee Anne Tigert.

Many protesters said they hoped the demonstration would lead to change, but others were skeptical. “If protesting changed anything, they’d make it illegal,” read a sign carried by attendee Brett Power. 
“I think a general strike is needed,” Power said, adding that he did not believe demonstrations on their own would effect significant change at the federal level. “The leverage people have is their labor,” he said.
Others said they hoped the protest would catch the attention of legislators and lead to change.
“This is what it’s going to take. Grassroots stuff like this, to get stuff done,” said protester Betty McKay. “Our legislators and congressmen need to be paying attention.”

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Hundreds of Arkansans marched down Capitol Avenue in downtown Little Rock Saturday morning in a joint effort to protest President Donald Trump’s administration and to celebrate LGBTQ+ Arkansans.
Little Rock’s addition to the nationwide No Kings protest movement, the second this year, coincided with Central Arkansas Pride’s annual march and celebration. The organizations behind both worked together to share resources and advocate for some of the same causes, Central Arkansas Pride Executive Director Dolores Wilk said in an interview.
Wilk said it’s important for Arkansans to challenge the stereotype that southern, Republican-led states are overwhelmingly bigoted against marginalized communities.
Harry Bounds and Bryan Strickland of Little Rock agreed that southerners can be “just as progressive” as non-southerners. Strickland is a lifelong Arkansan while Bounds grew up in Alabama.
“We believe in democracy, we believe in free speech,” Bounds said. “It’s very important that we dispel those [negative] stereotypes.”

Strickland and Bounds have been married for six years and told the Advocate they are concerned that the political right wing will overturn the legal right to same-sex marriage.
“We are here for equality, [so] everyone gets the same playing field,” Strickland said. “That’s not happening now.”
The couple said they also attended the first No Kings rally in June. That event saw thousands of attendees, who marched across the Broadway Bridge between Little Rock and North Little Rock.
Saturday’s No Kings rally began at 10 a.m. at the intersection of Broadway and Capitol Avenue in front of the federal courthouse. Five blocks down Capitol Avenue, Pride festivities kicked off at 11 a.m. between Chester and Pulaski streets, where No Kings rallygoers joined the Pride parade.
Central Arkansas Pride has held its annual event on the third Saturday in October for years, and it moved from North Little Rock’s Argenta neighborhood to Capitol Avenue this year because it needed more space to accommodate growing attendance, Wilk said.

Allowing the No Kings organizers to join the parade was an easy decision because of their support for civil rights of all kinds, Wilk said.
“They support queer rights, they support women’s rights, veterans rights, health rights,” Wilk said.
Grace Daugherty of Sherwood pointed out that Pride celebrations originated from a protest in New York City in 1969.
“It’s very important as a queer person, and especially as a white person, to stand up and be loud and fight back against fascism and the unfairness of this regime,” Daugherty told the Advocate.
The People’s Protests and Marches of AR hosted the Little Rock No Kings rally. Central Arkansas Pride, Indivisible LRCA and 50501 Arkansas are also listed as organizers of the Little Rock protest on the No Kings website.
 ‘Right is right and wrong is wrong’

Slogans on protesters’ signs included, “No kings, just drag queens,” “Fight truth decay,” “Jesus had 2 dads and he turned out fine,” and “The only orange monarch America wants is a butterfly.”
Protesters shouted a series of chants, including “The people united will never be divided,” “This is where we should be,” and “Love, not hate, makes America great.” Some attendees wore inflatable animal costumes, a trend that started with Portland, Oregon residents’ protest against National Guard presence in the city.
Portland is among a handful of Democrat-led major cities to which Trump has deployed troops with the stated purpose of fighting crime and maintaining order. One protest sign read, “Wait… we’re invading ourselves?”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has become more active under the Trump administration, sometimes detaining and deporting immigrants that are legally present in the country.
Elizabeth Wiggins carried a sign that said “Fight ignorance, not immigrants.”
“I think [Trump] wants us to be silent and not fight back and just take what he wants us to do, and I don’t agree with that,” she said.
Wiggins drove two and a half hours from El Dorado. The protest in Monroe, Louisiana was closer to home, but Wiggins said she wanted to protest with her friends that live in Central Arkansas.
Teana Bailey of Perryville, a 50-minute drive from Little Rock, said she was raised Republican but has been protesting the Trump administration because “right is right and wrong is wrong.”
“Everybody needs to talk now, because there may be a chance where it’s going to be harder and scarier,” Bailey said.

The Little Rock Police Department and Pulaski County Sheriff’s Office both sent officers to monitor Saturday’s events in coordination with the Pride and No Kings organizers. City police were present on the Arkansas Capitol steps, where some protesters came face to face with a small Christian rally that featured live music and calls for people to turn to Jesus.
Organizers planned the second annual Christian event months in advance and did not know until a few days ago that Pride and No Kings rallies were scheduled the same day, attendee Skylar Weidman told the Advocate.

“We almost didn’t do it again this year, but we believe the Lord told us to,” Weidman said.
The National Weather Service forecast severe storms, including lightning and high winds, for Saturday afternoon. Saturday morning saw sunny weather and temperatures in the 70s, and the weather became cloudy but not rainy in the early afternoon.
Wilk said organizers were “watching the weather very closely since the beginning of the week” and had contingency plans in place. Lightning within three miles would require shutting down the entertainment stage, which showcased live music and drag performers. The organizers planned to use the Victory Building near the Capitol as an emergency shelter from severe weather if necessary.
Small amounts of rain would not have deterred Pride festivities, Wilk said.
“Some of my best rainbows I’ve ever seen have been at Pride after rain,” Wilk said.

(Photo by Nate Billings/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — More than 1,000 people joined a No Kings protest Saturday outside City Hall in Oklahoma City, donning ponchos and inflatable costumes in the rain to rally against President Donald Trump. 
The No Kings protests, which took place in hundreds of cities across all 50 states and in the nation’s capital, are intended to denounce the Trump administration and rally against “chaos, corruption, and cruelty.” 
Many protest signs and speakers focused on anger with Trump’s deportation campaign using Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Congress’ failure to release the Epstein files and the conflict in Gaza.

Rosa Valdez said she’s never been involved in politics, but that seeing immigrants removed from their homes without due process brought her to the protest.
“There’s a lot of people that have been around me in my lifetime that have fallen victim to what is going on right now and have, unfortunately, been deported,” she said. “And just the way that everything has gone down, I know that they didn’t get any court (date) or anything like that.”
Duwayne Mills, an Oklahoma native, attended Saturday’s protests wearing a Ghostbusters outfit he altered to instead be a “Trump-busters” jumpsuit. 
He said the outfit was meant to be silly because “tyrants hate to be laughed at.”

“I’ve got two kids at home, and I will not have them brought up in this B.S.,” he said. “Because somebody … has some kind of ego trip going on and no one in that party will stop him because they’re just as corrupt as he is.”
Georgia Williams and Kim Reed said they joined the protest because of the actions of GOP leaders like House Speaker Mike Johnson and a dislike of the administration limiting press access at the White House. 
Organizers of the protests held a mock trial for Trump, alleging crimes such as using the military against civilians, obstructing justice, corruption and bribery. Speakers acted as prosecutors and witnesses in the trial, with the crowd of protestors acting as the jury and found Trump “guilty.” 
The protests were peaceful and there was no prominent counter protest or local police presence, but organizers hired security to ensure safety. 
Local organizations like Indivisible Oklahoma and 50501OK were the main organizers in Oklahoma City.
No Kings protests were planned in at least 18 other Oklahoma cities, according to organizers, including Ponca City, Bartlesville, Miami, Enid, Stillwater, Tulsa, Tahlequah, Muskogee, Guthrie, Chandler, Norman, McAlester, Ada, Pauls Valley, Lawton, Ardmore, Durant and Idabel.

Free.,No Kings day brings millions into US streets in anti-Trump protests,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/no-kings-day-brings-millions-us-streets-anti-trump-protests,,"WASHINGTON — Millions of Americans packed streets, parks and town squares across the United States Saturday for No Kings day, according to the organizers of the massive day of demonstrations protesting President Donald Trump’s administration — from his deployment of troops to cities to his targeting of political opponents.Thousands upon thousands showed up for the second organized No Kings day in America’s largest cities like Atlanta, New York City and Chicago, to smaller metro areas and towns including Greensburg, Pennsylvania; Bismarck, North Dakota; and Hammond, Louisiana. More than 2,600 nonviolent demonstrations were planned.The first No Kings day coincided with Trump’s military parade that occurred on his 79th birthday in June. Demonstrators decried Trump’s dispatch of National Guard troops to several U.S. cities, as well as ongoing immigration crackdowns in Los Angeles, the nation’s capital, Portland, Oregon, and Chicago and where U.S. citizens have been swept up in raids.

Ben Grimes, of Northern Virginia, who said he spent two decades in the U.S. Army piloting helicopters and working as a military lawyer, held a sign bearing the message “I Served America Not Autocracy.” Grimes stood among tens of thousands of demonstrators who stretched down several blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue at the Washington, D.C., No Kings day event.“We’re sliding very rapidly into autocracy and lawlessness,” said the 52-year-old veteran, whose career included a deployment to Baghdad. “Just about everything has worried me, but I am particularly concerned about the use of the deployment of military troops in the U.S. and the apparent lawless killing of civilians in the Caribbean,” Grimes said.

Peggy and Ken Greco donned clown costumes, and displayed a sign that read “Elect a Clown Expect a Circus.”The couple drove from Augusta, Georgia, to attend the D.C. rally.“We came because we feel very powerless about what’s going on, and we have to do something,” Peggy, 69, said, becoming emotional. In Chicago, Grant Park filled with thousands of people carrying symbols of repudiation of the Trump administration, particularly U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, from anti-ICE signs to posters satirizing the president.Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, also called on the crowd to be united and speak out.

Thousands of people gathered in Times Square in Manhattan for New York City’s No Kings day peaceful 1.6-mile march down 7th Avenue.Silas Perez, 21, who lives in the Bronx, said she “wants to fight for our rights while we still have them.” “They want to say ‘Make America Great Again.’ It was better before,” Perez said. “This is worse.” ""Democracy requires your courage, and tyranny requires good people doing nothing … and it fails when ordinary people refuse to cooperate and they say, 'no kings' and mean it,"" Pritzker said. In Lexington, Kentucky, protester Garcia O’Brien, 71, said, “I’m old, and I’ve never been scared for our democracy. I am now.” In Fargo, North Dakota, Ken Opheim showed up in a red hat but with an anti-Trump message: Quid Pro Quo Trump Must Go. ""Everything he does, he gets something back for himself,"" Opheim said.Lawmakers, activists and celebrities spoke at rallies across the country — Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in Atlanta, actor John Cusack in Chicago, Bill Nye “the Science Guy” in Washington, D.C. Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Chris Murphy of Connecticut also spoke to the massive crowd in the nation’s capital.“He has not won yet, the people still rule in this country,” Murphy, a Democrat, said. “Trump thinks that he’s a king, and he thinks he can act more corruptly when the government is shut down.”

The protesters took to the streets during the ongoing government shutdown to question Trump’s actions since he took office for his second presidential term on Jan. 20.Trump revamped his legally questionable mass firing of federal workers on Oct. 10, this time against the backdrop of the nearly three-week government funding lapse. Amid the shutdown, Trump this past week authorized a $20 billion bailout for Argentina. The administration also continues to amass defense resources along the coast of Venezuela and carry out extrajudicial strikes on alleged drug running boats in the Caribbean Sea, killing dozens.

Repeatedly, Trump has threatened to use the shutdown as an opportunity to permanently cut “Democrat programs that aren’t popular with Republicans” by canceling funding already appropriated by Congress.A member of his own party, GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said the Government Accountability Office should sue the for his administration’s illegal impoundment of funds already written into law — something he began to do long before the shutdown.Since January, Trump has canceled billions in foreign aid, medical research, natural disaster assistance, and funding for museums and libraries, early childhood education and energy efficiency programs for K-12 schools.

Trump’s use of power was on full display when he invoked the Alien Enemies Act in March and defied a federal judge’s order by sending hundreds of immigrants, many without due process, to a mega-prison in El Salvador. The mistakenly deported Kilmar Arego Garcia became the face of Trump’s mass deportation campaign.Nearly 300 partner organizations signed on to the nonviolent No Kings day, from local- and state-level groups to large national liberal advocacy bodies and labor unions, including the ACLU, Common Cause, Indivisible, the League of Women Voters and SEIU.

House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana recently described the event on Fox News as a “hate America rally,” claiming “it’s all the pro-Hamas wing and the antifa people.”Trump declared “antifa” as a “domestic terrorist organization” last month, despite the fact that such a group does not exist. “Antifa,” shorthand for anti-fascist, is an ideology disapproving of fascist governance.  He also issued a directive targeting progressive organizations, including Indivisible, according to a list the White House provided to Reuters.IN THE STATESWest VirginiaProtesters turn out en masse against Trump during No Kings protest at West Virginia Capitol, West Virginia Watch reports.Hundreds of protesters descended on the West Virginia capitol to speak out against detainments by ICE, potential federal cuts to health care programs, social safety nets and more that would largely impact already vulnerable people. OklahomaOver 1,000 gather in Oklahoma City as part of nationwide No Kings protests, the Oklahoma Voice reports.More than 1,000 people braved the rain in Oklahoma City, donning ponchos and inflatable costumes to join a protest outside City Hall.

The demonstration was part of the national No Kings protest movement, which had thousands of events scheduled Saturday in all 50 states. In Charleston, the rally was organized by the West Virginia Citizen Action Group, West Virginia Free, the state arm of the American Civil Liberties Union and the Charleston branch of the NAACP, as well as a newly formed grassroots nonprofit organization, West Virginia United.
Around 11 a.m., more than 200 people met at the Robert C. Byrd federal courthouse in downtown Charleston before marching two miles together to the state Capitol, on the city’s east end. There, they were met by about 200 more residents for a rally. Individuals continued to arrive as the event progressed.

Hundreds of people marched 2 miles this morning from the federal courthouse in Charleston, WV to the state capitol as part of the No Kings protests.
Marchers chanted “No kings, no KKK, no fascist USA” as they walked. Dozens of people honked as they drove by and others parked to join the march.

Attendees throughout the crowd wielded protest signs. Some were witty, some were insulting to Trump and other Republicans, while others featured pleas to the federal government to preserve democracy and work for the common good. The ages of the crowd widely ranged — parents pushed babies and toddlers in strollers while older residents, many in their 80s and 90s, sat holding their signs under trees to the side of the Capitol building.
Kathy Stalnaker, 65, said she attended the protest because she’s afraid for her childrens’ and grandchildrens’ futures. A retired teacher, it was far from Stalnaker’s first time protesting the government at the West Virginia state Capitol. She was present at the teacher and school service personnel strikes in 2018 and 2019.
Now, she said, it feels like there’s even more to speak up about.
“My main concern is for my children and grandchildren. I’ve studied history and Hitler and Mussolini — all of those dictators. That’s where we’re headed right now,” Stalnaker said. “Our country can’t go down the toilet this way. We’ve worked so hard and so long to establish this democracy. Now, we’ve got to fight for it.”

Stalknaker said it was a challenge deciding what to write on her protest sign. 
“There were so many things I could say, that I want to say,” Stalnaker said. “All week I’ve just been thinking, ‘I’m so sick of this. I’m sick of this fear and these threats.’”
Generally on Saturday, residents spoke against recent actions and detainments by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as potential federal cuts to health care programs, social safety nets and more that would largely impact already vulnerable people. They also spoke out against threats that have come against people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, journalists and activists, among others.

“It really does feel like people are in danger right now, real danger,” said Cheryl Pinckney, who attended the rally from St. Albans with her husband, Don Pinckney.
The Pinckneys moved to West Virginia more than 28 years ago. In recent years, Don Pinckney said, it feels like things have gotten more challenging. Now, they’re seriously considering leaving the state for the first time since they moved here.
“Politics didn’t feel as polarizing in the past, but honestly now we’re afraid,” Don Pinckney said.
“Things feel more permanent now — this hate, this division, all of these threats [to democracy],” Cheryl Pinckney continued. “I don’t know how we’re going to turn things around, but we’ve got to figure it out.”

The march and protest Saturday was a peaceful affair. People yelled in the crowds and chanted when prompted. Across Kanawha Boulevard, on the edge of the river, several law enforcement officers — from the West Virginia State Police, Charleston Police Department and the State Capitol Police — oversaw the event.

Speakers at the rally included representatives from several nonprofit organizations, including CAG and the ACLU. Del. Mike Pushkin, D-W.Va., played guitar for those in attendance after a speech where he asked all the older people in the crowd — those over 70, 80 or 90 years of age — to clap their hands.
Applause came from throughout the area.
“They’re out here because they know better. They’ve lived through several administrations and they know better,” Pushkin said. “These are the folks who know that democracy does not defend itself. We are not subjects, we are citizens. In America, we have no kings.

Salesianum scored in all three phases of the game to defeat the Jaguars, Friday night.
 
MIDDLETOWN — Salesianum defeated the Appoquinimink Jaguars, 49-0, Friday night earning its fourth win in a row and second straight shutout. Sallies scored all but seven of their points in the first half.
Appoquinimink started its first possession of the game with a trip to the red zone courtesy of a 48-yard pass from senior Desai Drummond to fellow senior Dominic Montebell on a deep crossing route to the right hashmark that Montebell secured with a one-handed grab on the run. Sallies’ defense held the Jaguars out of the endzone on the ensuing set of downs and forced a field goal attempt. 
Salesianum senior Jayvian Burrell rushed around the left side and blocked the attempt. He recovered the loose ball and ran it back down the left side for an 80-yard score to begin the night.
Sallies’ offense — led by quarterback Brady Nabb — scored on their first offensive possession with a 28-yard touchdown grab by receiver Devin Hasan near the front left pylon. Junior Jett Healy scored his first of two touchdowns of the game a possession after on a four yard run out of the wildcat formation. Healy’s other touchdown came on a punt return later in the second quarter.
The Sallies defense contributed a score in the first half on an interception from junior Kevin McConaghy in the late stages of the second quarter. A Jamar Taylor touchdown catch completed Sallies first half scoring on a night where Salesianum executed well in every phase of the game.
The Jaguars offense was able to move the ball down the field by completing a couple of deep passes, but the Salesianum defense held firm as Appoquinimink threatened. It’s the first time this season the Jaguars were held scoreless.  
It’s only Appoquinimink’s second loss of the season, but it breaks a stretch of three straight wins for the Jaguars including a thrilling overtime victory over Caravel on October 10. The Jaguars will remain at home for a matchup against Hodgson next Friday.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-18 17:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Reddit AMA recap: How does Mississippi spend its opioid settlement dollars?,Mississippi Today,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/18/mississippi-opioid-settlement-reddit-ama/,Allen Siegler answered your questions about how Mississippi’s elected officials have been managing about $124 million of Mississippi opioid settlement money.,"Mental health reporter Allen Siegler recently published a series of stories investigating how Mississippi’s elected officials have been managing about $124 million of Mississippi opioid settlement money — money that the state is receiving as a result of lawsuits against companies that profited off a devastating overdose crisis.
His findings were staggering.
Most of the money spent so far has been for lawyers’ fees or stuff that isn’t related to addiction, like police cameras and fiber optic cable installations.
And it’s not that the crisis is over — more people are dying now than seven years ago, when the biggest lawsuit was filed. But less than 1% of the Mississippi money has actually been used to stop the problem.
This project took over three months to report and write, and there were plenty of weird things that happened along the way. So Allen answered questions from our readers on Reddit, taking them behind the scenes on what it takes to undertake such an investigation.
You can read the conversation below. This includes guidance on how people can file a Freedom of Information Act request to access public records (with a link to a sample FOIA request you can use) and other actions community members can take to ensure these funds are used to address the problems highlighted in the lawsuits.

Some questions have been edited for length and clarity.
Q: What can we do to help pressure whoever is in charge of distribution of the funds?
Click for the answer.
I think it depends on what someone would want to accomplish. At the most direct level, the city/town council members and county supervisors are the people who decide where the local money goes. If your town, city or county is spending the money without the input of those most impacted by the crisis (which, to our knowledge, is every local government besides Hattiesburg), you could call city hall or the your supervisors and let them know what you think of that and where you think the money should go. Most elected officials’ emails are also publicly available, so contacting them that way could be a good strategy as well. 
The contract Attorney General Lynn Fitch made with the local governments is already finalized, so I don’t believe she can change the unrestricted terms of that spending. But other states’ attorneys general have provided guidance for how local governments should spend their money in overdose prevention, regardless of what their contracts say the cities and counties have to do. North Carolina’s former attorney general wrote extensive FAQs about local settlement spending that experts have brought up to me multiple times. If she wanted to/if her constituents made it known that’s something they want to happen, Fitch’s office could write similar guidelines.
To my knowledge, the only state group that can legally change how the towns, cities and counties spend their opioid settlement money is the Mississippi Legislature. And we’ve seen that happen in other states. Similar to Mississippi, Maine didn’t require its local governments to report what they were spending their settlement money on (although Emily Bader with The Maine Monitor did a remarkable job filling those reporting gaps where she could). Then this spring, state lawmakers passed a simple bill to require that from hereon out. If Mississippi lawmakers hear from their voters that they want a bill like this as well (or others that require the money to be spent on addiction-related purposes), they might look to pass similar legislation during the 2026 regular session. 

Q: I see a lot about police funds and even some that explicitly state money was put towards guns. My understanding is that some funds were allotted to counties to be used at their discretion.
Click for the answer.
In Mississippi, Fitch wrote a contract that says all the settlement money flowing to towns, cities and counties (expected to be around $63 million when all is said and done) can be spent for whatever public purpose their town/city council and Board of Supervisors think is appropriate. The settlements allow for up to 30% of spending to be on things that don’t have to do with addiction; because the local governments are getting 15% of the total Mississippi opioid settlement pie, all of their shares can be spent like any other public dollars. 
While this is technically allowed by the national settlements, the lawyers who wrote the settlements explicitly said they didn’t want that to happen. Most states created arrangements that say all the lawsuit money has to go to something related to addiction (even for purposes that have been criticized by the public). But as of right now, that’s not the case here.

Q: Are any of these funds discussed with constituents, or does it seem to entirely be at the whims of the ones in charge? How can we know whether or not they will a) use the remaining funds at all b) use them for anything remotely related to dealing with the supposed target issue?
Click for the answer.
Entirely at the whims of the ones in charge, at least for the local money. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Toby Barker, the mayor of Hattiesburg, created a committee this summer to advise how to spend the city’s settlement money. The committee, made up of locals who have experience addressing addiction, has come up with a few priorities so far, and I heard they’re in the process of moving forward on putting up money for those priorities. 
For questions A and B, it’s going to be hard if the current setup continues. For example, cities and counties have been getting money for three years now, but even those I consider most familiar with the Mississippi overdose crisis (people like James Moore in Hattiesburg) didn’t know anything about the local spending until I requested records and told him about that. But, as you allude to in your next question, anyone can request records from Mississippi governments. And I think we proved that while not ideal, the public record technique is an effective way to bring spending information to light. 

Q: Could you give a rundown of how one goes about requesting (or accessing) these documents?
Click for the answer.
Yep, no problem! First, you need to have an idea about what information you’re looking for and what documents might contain that information. I knew very little about the recordkeeping of these local settlements going into the project, so I asked for “All receipts of dollars received by the [local government name] related to the National Opioids Settlements since June 1,2022,” and “All internal records related to [local government name]’s spending of money received from the National OpioidSettlements since June 1, 2022.”Here’s one I sent to the city of Hattiesburg, which has all the template information to make sure we get the information as quickly and accessibly as possible. I tried to email them to city/town/chancery clerks, and sometimes added in the county administrator/government attorney. When a local government has a specific city portal or form, like Oxford and Long Beach respectively, I put the same information into those forms. I was expecting to receive documents like spending ledgers and city council resolutions from this request, which I sometimes did. But there were tons of other formats clerks and administrators used to provide me the information. I got everything from county budgets mostly unrelated to opioid settlement spending to a handwritten note saying nothing has been spent yet.
Sometimes, helpful public servants would call me to clarify what information I wanted. I nudged some of the clerks a lot, and made sure the Mississippi Ethics Commission knew when the public bodies were breaking state law. It took up most of my summer to do this with all 147 local governments, but I think the importance of this information justifies the work

Q: How are other states handling/distributing funds to address opioid overdoses? Who should the public turn to for recommendations on how best to use these funds to address the problems? Health professionals? Law enforcement officials? Local Politicians? How can the public be more involved?
Click for the answer.
It’s a very mixed bag from state to state. Like I wrote in this story, every other state has used at least $3 million of opioid settlement money to at least try to address their overdose crises. But that certainly doesn’t mean everything’s sunshine and roses everywhere else. 
Christine Minhee has a better national perspective on the settlement distribution than anyone I’ve met, and she created a state opioid settlement guide last December to give folks baseline information about what’s going on in each state. And the guides show that while there are states effectively using their dollars to prevent more deaths, there’s plenty of opportunities for spending that doesn’t address the opioid epidemic across the country. When I was reporting in West Virginia, I wrote a story about county leaders using nearly half a million settlement dollars for a shooting range. I just saw a story from Hawaii that leaders are using some of the state’s money for waterpark and Chuck E. Cheese vouchers. 
For best practice recommendations, there are a lot of national level resources (like Johns Hopkins University’s guide) that provide broad recommendations for how the settlement money can prevent more deaths.The settlements themselves have lists of strategies that are proven ways to curb the crisis. But public health professionals repeatedly told me that for any given town, city or county, the people who make up the community whose lives have been touched by the overdose catastrophe are the best people to share what will and won’t work. 

Q: Why would the crowd that diverted welfare money to a volleyball stadium with little consequences be expected to do the right thing with the settlement money?
Click for the answer.
I sent Anna Wolfe this question, and she said the welfare scandal teaches us that when public money intended to assist the state’s most vulnerable residents has so few guardrails, the likelihood it will be squandered is great (whether straight-up stolen or spent on things that have nothing to do with the intended purpose–both of which yield the same result: people don’t receive help and opportunities for better outcomes are lost). I think she’s completely right.
What I would add about the opioid settlement situation in particular is that the State Legislature, the group that will control as much as $300 million when all the payments come in, hasn’t done much to indicate one way or another how it will spend the money it oversees. We’ll know a lot more about what’s to come when the Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council presents recommendations for which overdose response efforts lawmakers should fund in December, and when the lawmakers act on those non-binding recommendations in the 2026 regular legislative session. I’ll be keeping eyes on what happens there, and I hope the public does too. 

Q: Are there any accountability frameworks that would allow the money to be used in a way that it benefits the actual victims of the opioid crisis?
Click for the answer.
I think so! I think the Maine bill that requires local spending reporting is a great way to encourage city and county leaders to be responsible stewards of the money. I think there could be a lot of ways states can incentivize spending on preventing more deadly overdoses and a lot of people willing to help develop these incentives. I cite many people with a lot of experience in that department in my stories. 

Q: How will the One Big Beautiful Bill impact mental health and those that work in this field in private practice, agency settings and psychiatry hospitals?
Click for the answer.
I won’t pretend to know everything about the health and health care implications of this summer’s federal spending bill. But nearly half of people diagnosed with opioid addiction used Medicaid, the state-federal insurance program for vulnerable Americans. 
So, I would guess that if fewer people have health insurance through Medicaid – which is what I understand the spending bill to incentivize in 2027 – that likely means fewer people can get effective opioid addiction treatment, like the medications buprenorphine and methadone.
This Kaiser Family Foundation article was published before the bill was passed, but I think it does a good job laying out the implications of Medicaid cuts on addressing the opioid epidemic.

Q: Has any of the spending been audited so far?
Click for the answer.
I have not come across any audits in my reporting. 

Q: How will the settlement be spent?
Click for the answer.
We mostly don’t know right now. Mississippi has received about $125 million as of this summer, but it’s slated to receive another roughly $300 million over the next 15 years. A lot can change in that time, from who’s making the decisions to what the addiction epidemic looks like. 
This graph I made breaks down what’s broadly happened with the $125 million. The biggest chunk of money is with the Legislature, and it’s unspent as of now. That will very likely change after the 2026 Regular Legislative Session, which begins in January and ends in April. I expect lawmakers to make some decisions for these dollars by April, and the public will know more then. 
The $15.5 million controlled by 147 towns, cities and counties can and is being spent on any public purpose their leaders want. This other graph I made digs into whether the local governments are spending the money on addiction, spending it on something else or not spending it yet. 

Q: A lot of states are using the opioid settlement to purchase equipment like Reassurance Solutions cell monitoring devices; basically vital sign radars that go in county detention centers and jails to monitor for overdoses (which happen most often within the first 24 hours of incarceration). Is tech like that a viable option for Mississippi’s funds?
Click for the answer.
I don’t know anything about that specific device, so I don’t want to comment on that specifically. But the settlement lawyers list initiatives that prevent more overdoses for inmates and former inmates as acceptable ways to address the crisis. They speak about providing “MAT (medication assisted treatment), recovery support, harm reduction, or other appropriate services” to people involved with the criminal justice system. 

Q: Grant decisions will be determined by the legislature. Will there be any opportunity for public comment on the grants recommended to the legislature?
Click for the answer.
I have not heard of any opportunities for public comment, and I don’t see anything in the law state senators and representatives passed in spring that says there will be public comment opportunities. But lawmakers don’t just make laws — they can also change them! So if Mississippians think public comment opportunities for how these dollars get spent are important, a good way to make that known would be to call/email their state senators and representatives. 

Q: Did you find that Mississippi officials resisted sharing records or delayed responses? If so, how did you overcome that and what rights do regular residents have to push back when agencies ignore or stonewall?
Click for the answer.
Oh, absolutely. The most common obstacle I came across was staying in contact with whoever handles the public records in any given town, city or county. I filed almost all of my records requests in mid-June, so I started following-up with local governments I hadn’t heard back from in early July. First, I would ask for an email update and often add the town/city/county attorney. For a lot of governments, that was enough. But going into mid-July, there were still dozens of governments that I hadn’t heard back from. 
From there, it branched out into a lot of phone calls to city halls and county boards of supervisors. Mississippi has laws that say public officials have to fully respond to public records requests by at most 14 business days, and it has a state Ethics Commission to enforce them.So I spent a lot of July reminding city or chancery clerks what the state’s public record act says. My deskmates got a kick out of the number of times I told record keepers I was going to loop in the ethics commissioner Thomas Hood about not receiving these records in a timely manner. But doing that usually worked, so I stand by it. 
For anyone looking to file records requests, feel free to copy and paste the language from my Hattiesburg FOIA where I talk about asking for electronic copies and other things of that nature. I would also recommend reading the public records act I linked above and the state’s model law so they know what you are and aren’t entitled to. If a government is looking to charge 50 cents a page for emailed copies of documents (as happened to me multiple times), that’s a problem. Tom Hood successfully mediated a number of these disagreements between public officials and me. If you run into any issues, you can loop him into the email thread (thood@ethics.state.ms.us), and he might be able to clear up any disagreements. If not, you can file an ethics complaint with his office. 

Q: Who is responsible for making sure this money is spent on addiction treatment instead of unrelated projects?
Click for the answer.
For the local Mississippi money, no one right now. There’s very few reporting requirements the settlements themselves actually require, and Attorney General Fitch’s agreement with cities and counties doesn’t require it either. But the state Legislature could pass a law to change that, if lawmakers think that’s an important priority. 
For the state’s money, Fitch has designated a small chunk of its share (“small chunk” is relative as it’s still expected to be over $60 million in total) for purposes that don’t have to address addiction. The settlements say the remaining pot of money, set to be around $300 million by 2040, has to be spent on addressing addiction. 
The law the Legislature passed this spring says the Attorney General’s Office is in charge of making sure the money is spent legally. So, unless the Legislature changes something, the person responsible is Fitch or whoever is attorney general in the future. 

Q: When you filed 147 records requests, how many governments actually complied fully and how many gave partial or no responses?
Click for the answer.
For 141 governments, I believe public officials gave me their best estimates of how much money they’ve received and how they’ve been spending the funds. That doesn’t mean I think they got all the information right. For instance, Gulfport wrote me a letter that they hadn’t spent any of their money despite meeting minutes showing that they spent $4,000 for a holiday feeding program in 2023. There could be other governments that did similar things that my editor and I didn’t catch. 
Three governments — Byram, Tunica County and Kosciusko — found some but not all of the payments they’ve received. So their numbers are likely underestimates of the total money they’ve received. 
Moss Point and Rankin County never told me how they’re spending their dollars, and we noted that in the various charts and graphs. Mound Bayou was the only government to provide no information, which led me to file this ethics complaint against the city in August. 

Q: Were there clear reporting requirements for these funds, or is it left up to local officials to decide what to disclose?
Click for the answer.
The only reporting requirements I’m familiar with in the settlements is for a chunk of the money that is allowed to be spent for purposes other than addiction. My understanding is this provision was added for tax purposes for the pharmaceutical companies paying the settlements. 
That money is supposed to be reported here. My understanding is that if/when the Legislature spends some of its settlement money without the recommendations of the advisory committee, that spending will have to show up here. But I don’t know if there’s an enforcer of this reporting.


Q: From your experience, what is the most effective way for everyday citizens to get attention on financial mismanagement of public records, media coverage, state agencies, or something else?
Click for the answer.
I think reaching out to the local public officials making decisions is a good first step. Now that MT has published our database, there’s hopefully less room for elected officials to say they don’t know what’s going on with the opioid settlements they oversee. I came across many local officials who said they wanted this money to be spent appropriately — they just didn’t exactly know how to do that. So a nudge/recommendation from a helpful constituent could go a long way. 
If that doesn’t work, and state senators and representatives don’t respond to calls and emails, I think going to the media might be a good idea. It’s a story I’d be interested in trying to write, and it looks like Gulf States Newsroom’s Drew Hawkins (whose opioid settlement work I really admire) is looking to produce stories like that as well.  

Q: If Mississippi is spending less than 1% of opioid settlement money on the crisis itself, what avenues are there for residents to push for change? Lawsuits? Federal oversight? Public campaigns?
Click for the answer.
I’m not sure. The general local spending is allowed by both the law and the settlements (although the lawyers say non-addiction spending is “disfavored”), so it’s not illegal. One of the biggest issues I’ve seen in Mississippi’s opioid settlement distribution is because so little information was made public, most people aren’t familiar with the spending or the settlements themselves. 
At large, it just hasn’t been on the Mississippi media and public’s radar.
I hope that starts to change with this “Black Box” series, but I don’t know what will happen. In my experience, nearly everyone I’ve talked with says overdoses are bad and the government should do whatever it can to prevent them. 
Attorney General Fitch and Jackson Mayor John Horhn held a press conference yesterday to say just that. So, if the public continues to connect those dots to the opioid settlement money, I would hope that decision makers see that spending the money for overdose response and prevention is aligned with their priorities. 
In other states, citizens dismayed by opioid settlement spending on things other than addiction have been able to draw a lot of public attention with protests and editorials. I don’t know if that solves all the problems, but it would certainly make this general spending more visible. 

Q: How were local needs assessed, what outcomes will be measured to determine program effectiveness due to funding, and how are programs or intervention evaluated & will the results be shared publicly? 
Click for the answer.
Because Attorney General Fitch didn’t require local governments to spend the money they oversee on addiction, I found little evidence that there’s been many needs assessments or program evaluation. That could change if Mississippi’s laws and resources change, but for now Hattiesburg is the only government I could find using citizen input to assess how this local money can be spent to best prevent more overdoses.

Q: Can you let me know if ANYONE/ ANYWHERE has purchased or contemplated purchasing Fentanyl test strips?
Click for the answer.
Anecdotally, I know people who use test strips to verify what’s in their drug supply. But I haven’t asked them if they purchased the strips or were given them by a mutual aid group.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/17143758/IMG_6416-1.jpg,,,2025-10-18 13:58:08.404856

Key Events







Grandson of immigrants worries about economy, due process
Mike Ondek of Nashville wore an inflatable chicken suit to attend the capital city’s protest, held on the grounds of the Tennessee Capitol. His parents immigrated to the U.S. from Slovakia and he said he’s concerned about the Trump administration’s immigration policies, deployment of National Guard troops to U.S. cities and a lack of due process for those being deported.
But the economy is also on his mind.
“I don’t like what’s going on and I’m supposed to be retiring this year and I have no idea what’s going on with Medicaid, the economy,” Ondek said. “I lost so much last time the economy tanked with my 401(k) and built it back up but there’s so much uncertainty.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/201e6f9f-a4cb-4878-bd0c-90b54d8849d7-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-18 12:03:35.819744

Piscitelli,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/18/no-child-should-come-home-to-an-empty-house/,We do not want our neighborhoods turned into staging grounds for immigration crackdowns aimed to stroke the right-wing base. .,"Last Wednesday, October 15, federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents stormed the Optimo Car Wash on Dixwell Avenue in Hamden. Mid-morning, eight people had been detained, including both employees and customers. 
At 10:23 a.m., I witnessed dozens of tactical gear-clad agents as they held eight of our neighbors in vehicles on Pine Rock Avenue, a stone’s throw from Eli Whitney Technical High School and Southern Connecticut State University. Some of our neighbors were parents of young children who were still in school, unaware that mom or dad would not be there when school was dismissed. How is this ok?
This was not law enforcement done responsibly; it was just another example of a show of force from an administration that seeks to pit neighbors against neighbors in a calculated and continued effort to divide the American public and consolidate power.
I don’t dispute that Homeland Security and ICE have the authority to enforce immigration law, but authority without compassion erodes legitimacy. The Hamden raid was not targeting dangerous criminals or fugitives. It targeted our neighbors who were washing cars to earn a paycheck, trying to make ends meet and provide for their loved ones.
Similar ICE raids have been reported in New Britain, Southington and Newington in recent months. Each time, ICE has acted unilaterally, disregarding the work of local leaders who strive to balance enforcement with compassion. We do not want our neighborhoods turned into staging grounds for immigration crackdowns aimed to stroke the right-wing base. When federal agents act as if our communities are the battlefield, they undermine the very democratic values they claim to protect.
ICE raids don’t happen in a vacuum. Raids lead to community fear and fear keeps people from reporting crimes or cooperating with police. How can local police department build trust when residents worry that any knock on the door might be ICE in disguise? Effective law enforcement relies on relationships; heavy-handed raids by masked law enforcement agents destroy them.

ICE must coordinate with local governments when operations could affect families or children. Schools and social services must have emergency protocols to identify and assist minors whose parents are suddenly detained. And above all, our elected officials should reaffirm that Connecticut stands for dignity, due process, and decency. 
At a press conference following the raid, State Sen. Jorge Cabrera said, “Give people a path to citizenship. That’s what American’s support. But don’t arrest hardworking, taxpaying immigrants.” Gallup’s July 2025 data supports Cabrera’s statement. According to Gallup, “support for allowing undocumented immigrants to become U.S. citizens has risen to 78%, up from 70% last year.”
After a couple of days, the story is beginning to fade on local news stations, but for the families torn apart, the trauma will last far longer. We are overwhelmed with story after story, and too many of us have become numb to the callousness of the Trump administration. We can’t allow this to become the new normal. 
More than three quarters of us agree that a pathway to citizenship is the answer; more of us must believe that no child should come home from school to find their parents gone without a trace.

Stephen C. “Steve” Cawood, an Eastern Kentucky lawyer who championed coal miners, clean water and better schools, died Oct. 17, three days after his 82nd birthday. 
Grandson to both a county sheriff and a circuit judge, Cawood worked to alleviate Appalachia’s poverty as a volunteer and activist. He was unafraid to challenge the region’s powerful coal industry as an attorney and one-term state legislator. 
He died at Baptist Health Hospital in Lexington after a lengthy battle with bladder cancer. 
“The loss of Steve Cawood will be felt throughout our commonwealth, but especially in Eastern Kentucky,” said Gov. Andy Beshear. “From protecting our state resources to increasing education access, Steve dedicated himself to work that helped build a brighter future for Kentuckians. Britainy and I are praying for his family. He will be missed.”
Environmental lawyer Tom FitzGerald of the Kentucky Resources Council said Cawood “embodied a rich tradition in Eastern Kentucky of progressive people who could have gone anywhere and been successful but decided to stay home and work with the cards dealt them to make the lives of their neighbors better.”
Pineville days
Cawood was born in Pineville on Oct. 14, 1943, to Murrell and Sophia Gilbert Cawood. His father ran a hardware store. Cawood’s maternal grandfather was Circuit Judge James M. Gilbert, who presided in Bell and Harlan counties. His paternal grandfather had been a sheriff of Harlan County. He was predeceased by his sister, Janie Cawood Brooking and brother Tom Cawood.
Cawood said in an oral history interview that his family’s social and economic position, as well as living in town, insulated him from the poverty in the surrounding countryside and coal camps.
“I grew up in the small town of Pineville and it’s a funny, peculiar kind of town to the extent that it is a very cohesive community that revolves around one little high school,” he said. “It has a very leveling effect on the children who are raised here. It did then and it does today to the extent that it was not unusual to find myself on a given summer day as a child lying on the river bank with kids from the poor section of town and kids from the wealthier section of town. Or playing in the woods or in a Scout troop or in a football game.” 
“I knew there were coal miners,” Cawood said of growing up in Pineville. “There were six or eight kids in my class who were left fatherless by the Fourmile mine explosion in 1945. But I knew nothing of the life they lived at home. I had not ever been exposed to the anger. I was not raised in poverty.” 
Kid from Eastern Kentucky
As a student at Eastern Kentucky University, Cawood became involved in the initial planning of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s 1964 War On Poverty. 
“Shortly after the death of President Kennedy and the presidency of Lyndon Johnson, there was a think tank established in Berea, Kentucky,” Cawood recalled in a 1991 interview. The group met to talk about “how to go about designing a program to have socio-economic change in Appalachia, ” he said, and “basically designed” the Economic Opportunity Act, the 1964 law that was the centerpiece of the Johnson era War on Poverty. The Berea confab pieced together what became the Appalachian Volunteers, a kind of domestic Peace Corps. 
“I got involved because they (those organizing the War On Poverty) wanted kids from Eastern Kentucky to advise them,” Cawood recalled. “They were looking for ideas. They didn’t pretend to have all the answers.” 
The impetus for this effort came from President John F. Kennedy’s tour of West Virginia during his 1960 primary campaign. Kennedy “was shocked by what he saw in West Virginia,” Cawood said.

In his senior year at EKU, Cawood joined the Appalachian Volunteers, which he described as a “ragtag bunch of bright, caring people.”
Initially under the Council of the Southern Mountains, the Appalachian Volunteers, or AVs, took on community projects such as repairing schools, winterizing homes and leading recreation programs. The group split off in 1966 and took a more activist stance, helping organize local citizens groups, pushing for poor people to have more say in anti-poverty programs and supporting protests against surface mining, according to “Uneven Ground: Appalachia Since 1945” by Ronald D. Eller and The Kentucky Encyclopedia.
Politicians in Appalachia came to regard the AVs as a threat to local power structures. The federal government cut funds and the program closed in 1970, though many members stayed on and continued their advocacy.
Cawood later said the AVs’ most lasting contribution was giving individuals like Eula Hall the courage to speak up and gain support. Hall was an Appalachian activist and health care pioneer who founded the Mud Creek Clinic in Grethel in Floyd County.
In his second year of law school at the University of Kentucky, Cawood married Jeanette “Sissy” McCauley, the daughter of a Middlesboro mayor, who was starting her junior year of college. They would have two daughters: Beth (Bill) Overman of Lexington and Mandy (JD) Hickey of Lookout Mountain, Tennessee, and five grandchildren.
He was in a group of law students who went to Bell County one summer to find out what legal services were needed. The “raw anger” and tremendous poverty he encountered made a permanent impression on him, he said, in part because he had grown up in Bell County oblivious to the conditions.
In 1968, Cawood helped coordinate Robert F. Kennedy’s presidential campaign tour of Eastern Kentucky. He rode in the car with Kennedy. “I was getting ready to join (the campaign) when Bobby was killed (June 5, 1968),” said Cawood.
Working with coal miners
On Dec. 30, 1970 an explosion at the non-union Finley Mine at Hurricane Creek near Hyden killed 38 men, bringing attention to lax enforcement of federal mine safety laws. Cawood represented survivor A.T. Collins who was blown out of the mine by the explosion.
Phil Primack, who had started working as a reporter at The Mountain Eagle a few months earlier, first met Cawood when he covered the disaster. Cawood “became an invaluable guide to mine safety laws, multiple violations of which led to the explosion, as well as the failures of state and federal regulators to enforce them,” Primack said.
“When he represented A.T. Collins, the disaster’s sole survivor, Steve was more than just the attorney for an individual — he stood for all coal miners and their families and communities,” Primack said. “He was a caring and passionate advocate, a great storyteller, and a good friend.”
Cawood represented striking miners at the Brookside mine in Harlan County in 1973-74 and traveled with them on tours of the country.
Cawood also represented opponents of strip mining in a group called Save Our Kentucky. 
Cawood helped spotlight the plight of coal miners suffering from black lung, an incurable occupational disease caused by breathing coal dust. He completed a legal services survey identifying injustices facing black lung victims. He recalled that some of those involved in the survey later became instrumental in the Black Lung Movement, demanding recognition and compensation for health damage and better dust control in mines.

Working for the Presbyterian Board of Missions, he helped launch the Appalachian Research and Defense Fund or AppalReD, which still provides legal services to low-income people across the region.
In Pineville, Cawood, a Presbyterian, became city attorney, president of the Pineville Chamber of Commerce and chairman of the Salvation Army Board. He was a member of the Sierra Club and Masons and served on the Governor’s Task Force on Floods and the Pineville Flood Evacuation board. 
Stephen Ford, then a reporter for the Courier Journal in Louisville, covered widespread flooding in Eastern Kentucky in 1977. “Pineville was inundated by the Cumberland River,” he recalled. “Most of the town was under water, and it was completely inaccessible by road. I was able to get to Pineville on a boat operated by the Army Corps of Engineers. The Cawoods’ house was on dry ground on a hillside, and Steve and Sissy immediately offered their home as a makeshift news bureau. Local reporters and I were able to work there.
“I suppose as an activist lawyer and someone with modest political aspirations, Steve felt comfortable working with the press. But I also think he deeply loved Pineville and Bell County, and he truly wanted people elsewhere to understand the grave crisis and destruction his community faced.
“That was characteristic of Steve. He stood ready whenever called upon to make contributions, large and small.”
Courier Journal reporters and editors began jokingly referring to Cawood’s office as the “Pineville bureau,” a place where reporters could write, make calls or just collect their wits and some good stories. 
Like many in Pineville, the Cawoods were involved in putting on the annual Mountain Laurel Festival at Pine Mountain State Park. His wife has a photo of Steve at age 5 serving as a train bearer for the festival’s queen with the late Gov. Earle Clements in the background.
Recovery
Sissy Cawood said her husband “would want others to know there is a good life in sobriety” and that he “earned” a chip for 29 years of sobriety in August. Her husband, she said, was grateful to Alcoholics Anonymous and his sponsor, Al Smith, the founding host of Kentucky Educational Television’s “Comment on Kentucky.”

Smith’s sponsorship “was not an easy job,” Sissy Cawood said, “as Steve dealt with feelings of anger, frustration and whatever else alcohol does to your brain after a lifetime of drinking.”
Smith’s wife, Martha Helen Smith, asked Cawood to speak at Smith’s memorial service in 2021. “Al thought the world of Steve,” she said.
Frankfort
In 1980, Cawood, a Democrat, was elected to the state House of Representatives and quickly made a name for himself.
House Speaker Bill Kenton appointed Cawood to chair the House subcommittee on strip mining, which overhauled Kentucky’s law to meet tougher federal standards enacted by Congress in 1977. 
“Add his black-lung efforts and other legal work for miners, and you have one of the greatest bodies of work of any Kentuckian to protect people in the mountains from the adverse effects of what was their major industry. I am proud to have been his friend,” said Al Cross, emeritus journalism professor at the University of Kentucky.
Former House Speaker Greg Stumbo, D-Prestonsburg, entered the House in 1980 with Cawood.
“Steve Cawood had a good moral compass. Everything he did was for the right reasons — whether it be for the environment or the people of Eastern Kentucky,” said Stumbo. “He had to walk a tightrope sometimes in his political battles, and he failed, like all of us, sometimes. But he represented the kind of person in government that we need more of today. He was willing to reach across the aisle to work with his political opponents if he knew that was the right thing to do for the people.”
Rocky Adkins, Beshear’s senior adviser and a longtime friend of Cawood, said, “Steve Cawood was a true and trusted friend, and I was lucky to know and work with him for years. We were focused on making our state a better place for families — especially in our home of Eastern Kentucky. This is a tough loss, but I know his legacy will continue on. Leah and I are praying for Steve’s family.” 
Former state representative and chairman of the Kentucky Democratic Party Jerry Lundergan, of Lexington, was also in the House’s freshman class of 1980. 
“You didn’t have to talk to Steve Cawood very long to tell where his interests were. They were in Eastern Kentucky,” said Lundergan. “At an early meeting with Greg and me, Steve wanted us to be sure to know how important the severance tax on coal was to Eastern Kentucky. He was a model citizen-legislator.”
Cawood lost his bid for reelection to another Democrat, Pearl Ray Lefevers, but remained a citizen activist.
Advocacy
He was one of the early members of the Prichard Committee for Academic Excellence which advocated for the Kentucky Education Reform Act of 1990. He took the challenge of reform seriously and ran for the Pineville Independent school board. He became its chair, hired a new superintendent and worked to create a space between the old and new schools called the Commons that became a community venue in Pineville as well as a place for students. 
Cawood worked to protect his region’s water and forests. He collaborated on successful legal efforts to protect the watersheds that supply Pineville and Middlesboro from the effects of mining. He was a supporter of the Kentucky Natural Lands Trust, especially its efforts to preserve Blanton Forest in Harlan County. 
In his later years, Cawood, a railroad buff, worked on moving archives of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad from a basement in Bowling Green to the Tennessee Rail Museum in Chattanooga where they are now housed.He did the legal work and negotiations at no charge because of his lifelong love of trains, Sissy Cawood said.
He also assisted Dr. John Fox, a Lexington surgeon, in identifying pioneer Daniel Boone’s actual steps through Kentucky.
For fun, Cawood amassed a large collection of scrip, currency used to pay coal miners that was redeemable only at stores owned by the coal company that employed them. 
James Branscome, a journalist and retired managing director of Standard & Poor’s, has known Cawood since 1971.
“Of all the mountain advocates for miners and others in Eastern Kentucky, I don’t know of anyone who has been the source of more information for journalists, congressional staffers, fellow attorneys, organized black lung groups, and labor leaders like the United Mine Workers Association,” said Branscome.
“Steve was a highly respected source for the latest news on topics related to coal and miners, coal history, and virtually any topic related to Appalachia, and especially black lung and black lung regulation and compensation. 
“He was a frequent visitor with friends for trout fishing and camping in the Cherokee National Forest in Tennessee. He and Sissy vacationed on Pawley’s Island, South Carolina, almost every year.”
Funeral arrangements are pending.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)President Donald Trump has endorsed an opponent to challenge Northern Kentucky Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie. 
In a lengthy Friday evening post to Truth Social, Trump said he hoped Ed Gallrein “gets into the Race against Massie” and was highly critical of the incumbent congressman, calling him “a Weak and Pathetic RINO from the Great Commonwealth of Kentucky, a place I love, and won big SIX TIMES” who “must be thrown out of office, ASAP!” 
Ed Gallrein
A a former Navy Seal from Shelby County, Gallrein has not formally announced a run in the 4th Congressional District, but the president’s “Complete and Total Endorsement” makes the case for why he should. Shelby County is in the southern part of Kentucky’s 4th Congressional District. 
Gallrein lost a competitive Republican primary to state Sen. Aaron Reed in the 7th Senate District last year. Former state Sen. Adrienne Southworth lost the race amid tension within her caucus. Gallrein was seen as the establishment candidate in the primary, having a donation from Republican Senate President Robert Stivers and an endorsement from the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce. 
Reed’s name had been floated as a possible challenger to Massie this summer, but he told reporters in August that he was “happy being a senator right now” and was preparing for the 2026 legislative session.
Massie recently toured the congressional district with ally U.S. Sen. Rand Paul for a mix of official and campaign events. During that, Paul, a leader of Tea Party Republicans, said he was ready to endorse Massie and if someone asked about waiting to see who could run against the congressman, “I can’t imagine that they’d even try it.”
In his post, Trump said “the Great People of Kentucky are wise to” Massie’s positions — which are sometimes at odds with the president. Trump said Massie “only votes against the Republican Party, making life very easy for the Radical Left.”  
“Unlike ‘lightweight’ Massie, a totally ineffective LOSER who has failed us so badly, CAPTAIN ED GALLREIN IS A WINNER WHO WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN,” Trump said. “Should he decide to challenge Massie, Captain Ed Gallrein has my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN, ED, RUN — MAGA!” 
Massie, whose brand of Republican politics has drawn a loyal base of Libertarian supporters in the congressional district, has been leading the charge to release the federal investigation files on convicted sex offender and financier Jeffery Epstein. Though the president campaigned on declassifying the files, Trump has more recently opposed releasing them.
Earlier this year, Massie also drew the president’s wrath for opposing Trump’s bombing of Iran and voting against the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Trump has previously vowed to oust Massie from office. A super PAC tied to the president spent more than $1 million on ads against the congressman — without a clear challenger named yet. 
After Trump’s endorsement of Gallrein was issued, Massie pushed a fundraising link on X, saying “I can beat this candidate if I have your support.” Earlier this week, the congressman posted the best fundraising numbers of his career, including bringing in nearly $768,000 in contributions from July to September.
Massie told Politico that Gallrein is a “failed candidate and establishment hack” following Trump’s endorsement.
“After having been rejected by every elected official in the 4th District, Trump’s consultants clearly pushed the panic button with their choice of failed candidate and establishment hack Ed Gallrein,” Massie said. “Ed’s been begging them to pick him for over three months now.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2204622175-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-18 10:00:18.284436

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s two largest airports aren’t airing a video by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that blames Democrats for the government shutdown.  
Officials with the biggest airport in the state — Omaha-based airport Eppley Airfield — aren’t playing the video because DHS and the Transportation Security Administration have not requested to show the video at the Omaha airport or on its screens or systems, an Eppley Airfield spokesperson said. The airport in Lincoln lacks video monitors in its TSA screening area, so the video can’t be played. 
Omaha and Lincoln join airports in Atlanta, Buffalo, N.Y., Charlotte, Chicago, Las Vegas, New Jersey, Phoenix, Portland, Ore., and Seattle that have confirmed not playing the Noem video. Airport officials in those states point to local policies and state laws restricting politicking in those spaces for the reason, according to NPR. Texas airports are refusing to play the video for similar reasons.
Airports typically run most videos from the Homeland Security head on screens at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, but these generally relate to safety information and don’t get political.

The video posted by White House shows Noem saying it’s “​​TSA’s top priority to make sure that you have the most pleasant and efficient airport experience as possible while we keep you safe,” but “Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government, and because of this, many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA employees are working without pay.”
With the federal government shut down and no end in sight, the Trump administration has used government websites and agencies  — which are supposed to avoid politicking — in a messaging battle over who is to blame for Congress not funding the federal government, for the shutdown. 
For example, websites for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Housing and Urban Development posted messages blaming the “Radical Left” in Congress. The Trump administration is also inserting language in some automated email responses blaming Democrats for the impasse. 
Democratic senators now allege that the Department of Homeland Security violated the Hatch Act, a 1939 law that prohibits political activities of federal employees to ensure government programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion, by asking airports to play the video blaming Democrats for the shutdown. It’s unlikely Noem would face any consequences, according to legal experts.

Sign up for Votebeat Michigan’s free newsletter here.
Taxpayers will be on the hook for reprint costs after Dearborn, Michigan, printed and mailed out thousands of ballots that listed an incorrect candidate. But it’s unclear whether paying the bill will be the responsibility of the city or Wayne County.
City officials estimate that Dearborn printed about 10,000 ballots that incorrectly listed Mohammed Shegara as a candidate for City Council even though he dropped out of the race in April. Roughly 9,000 of those went out to voters, City Clerk George Darany told Votebeat.
To reprint and resend corrected ballots cost about $3,600, Darany said. The postage part of that, 21.3 cents per ballot, came out of the city’s account already, but no one has been billed yet for the reprint part, which is about 15 cents a ballot.
Darany said the error involved officials in both the city and county clerk’s offices — the county is responsible for designing the ballot — so the city may ask the county to shoulder part of the cost. County officials, for their part, say the cost should fall squarely on Dearborn.
When his office submitted the lists of candidates to the county in the spring, Darany said, officials noted multiple times that Shegara had dropped out of the race by the city’s deadline.
“Unfortunately, when we received the proof ballot (from the county), his name was still on it,” Darany said. His staff found and pointed out other errors, he said, but “we didn’t notice that person’s name.” (Shegara told the Detroit Free Press that he was confused when he saw his name on the ballot.)
Several people in the Dearborn Clerk’s office review the ballot, including the deputy clerk and the elections supervisor, but Darany is the final signoff.
While Wayne County officials designed the ballot, they said Dearborn should pay for the reprint, particularly as the ballot contains only local races: Dearborn’s mayor is up for reelection, as is Darany. The entire City Council is also on the ballot, alongside a proposal to expand the council and divide the city into wards for council representation.
“In this case, the Dearborn City Clerk and the Dearborn City Election Commission failed to correct the error on the ballot proof prior to approval,” Dorian Tyus, spokesperson for Wayne County Clerk Cathy Garrett, wrote in an email Wednesday.
The city clerk’s office and the city’s election commission “will be responsible for the cost of reprinting the ballots in this case,” Tyus wrote.
Genya Coulter, election systems analyst at the Open Source Election Technology Institute, said such issues with ballots are more common than people realize, particularly in places like Michigan where so many communities run their own elections.
In Owosso last summer, a misplaced decimal point meant a heading in a millage question was different from the question itself. No one caught the error until a few weeks before the election, “despite multiple rounds of proofreading,” City Clerk Amy Kohagen said at the time. (In an interview with Votebeat, she recalled the time years ago when a county ballot had the word “public” misspelled as “pubic.”) Reprints have also been required after candidates were incorrectly left off the ballot or after incorrect color coding meant voters got the wrong ballot for their precinct.
Coulter said Dearborn officials did the right thing after discovering the error by publicizing the problem early and immediately implementing a solution
That quick acknowledgement meant that only a small number of residents — about 5% of absentee voters — had actually returned the incorrect ballots before the problem was noticed, Darany said. Voters should have their new ballots, marked with a bright green sticker, in their hands already.
If voters return both ballots, the original ballot will be spoiled and the correct one will be processed. For voters who return the initial ballot but not the corrected one, poll workers will have to copy their choices onto a corrected ballot and process that one. Only one ballot will ultimately be counted for each voter.
That’s already a familiar procedure for the city, Darany said. Last year, the city had to process about 350 ballots that way because overseas and military voters’ ballots “come back on a form,” and the choices have to be copied onto a ballot for counting, he said.
This year, he expects that even with the error, that number of ballots that need to be copied over will be the same or lower. The city will have extra people on standby to help.
As for the cost, Darany figures the city is still ahead of the game.
“One thing people don’t know is that we were planning at the end of the November to give the City Council a report letting them know how much we saved this year on elections because we did some consolidations, which means fewer workers, fewer tabulators to test and so on,” Darany said. “We were prepared to give the council a letter saying we had saved $27,000 this year amid our effort to make our elections more efficient. Now it just might be $27,000 minus that $3,600.”

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Demonstrators will gather in dozens of Colorado cities and towns on Saturday as part of a nationwide No Kings protest in opposition to President Donald Trump’s administration.
It’s expected to be the largest day of anti-Trump demonstrations since June, when an estimated 5 million Americans attended No Kings events held in at least 2,000 cities around the country. The No Kings movement’s organizers include a long list of liberal and progressive groups like Indivisible, MoveOn and the ACLU.
Events are planned in Colorado communities as far-flung as Lamar, Fort Morgan, Steamboat Springs and Cortez, according to a map shared by organizers. They include a protest on the steps of the state Capitol in Denver, scheduled for noon, as well as one planned for 10:30 a.m. on Main Street in the Costilla County town of San Luis, population 628.

Organizers say they’re demonstrating against Trump’s “authoritarian actions and power grabs.” Since taking office in January, Trump has drawn widespread criticism and countless legal challenges to a series of attempted executive actions that run contrary to longstanding separation-of-powers principles in the U.S. Constitution, including the mass firings of federal workers and the freezing or cancellation of congressionally-authorized spending.
Trump has also invoked centuries-old wartime powers to justify an unprecedented immigration crackdown as he seeks to fulfill his promise to deport 12 million people living in the U.S. without permanent legal status. The latest No Kings protests come as Trump has ordered the deployment of National Guard troops to support Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in the cities of Chicago and Portland, which he has falsely described as “war ravaged” in spite of recent nonviolent anti-ICE protests that have prominently featured inflatable animal costumes and naked bicycle rides.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026, is among those who have encouraged Coloradans to demonstrate peacefully at Saturday’s protests. As attorney general, Weiser has sued the Trump administration at least 37 times since January on matters ranging from withheld funding and federal worker layoffs to tariffs and the administration’s attempt to end birthright citizenship.
“Show up at the No Kings rally on Oct. 18 at the Capitol — as many people as possible, and be as peaceful as possible,” Weiser told 9News in an interview last week. “Don’t be afraid to show up, but also, we’ve got to be peaceful.”

(Photo by Christina Lords/Idaho Capital Sun)America was born in protest. In fact, we might never have separated from Great Britain, were it not for a list of grievances written into our Declaration of Independence 249 years ago. The 13 British colonies had had enough of the arbitrary actions of King George III and peaceably advised him so in that treasured document. 
Several years later, with those grievances in mind and in hopes of preventing a recurrence of lawless actions by America’s new government, our ancestors wrote up a Constitution and Bill of Rights. Our First Amendment, guaranteed “the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” The First Amendment stands out as a principal protection against arbitrary king-like rule.
Why this former Republican is going to a No Kings protest in Idaho

Ever since he took office in January, we have witnessed a growing contempt for the constitutional order, including free-speech rights, by Donald Trump and his MAGA crowd. If wide swaths of Americans object to his arbitrary, unconstitutional orders and actions, he and his minions don’t write it off as Americans exercising their constitutional rights. He sees it as a threat to his royal eminence. Those who protest are labeled as “domestic terrorists, agitators, anarchists” and even worse. 
Many who fear the path Trump is taking toward despotic rule have gathered in communities across the country to hold “No Kings” rallies. The purpose is to speak out against despotic words and unconstitutional action by the Trump regime. I spoke at a rally held on April 5 in Twin Falls by the local chapter of Indivisible. It was a well-attended patriotic rally of good, decent folks spanning the political spectrum.
The No Kings rallies across America on June 14 protested Trump’s lavish military parade in Washington that was timed to celebrate his kingly birth. The protest also called him out for his repeated and deliberate transgressions of the U.S. Constitution. The Indivisible patriots had to step forward because the cowardly GOP members of Congress don’t have the courage to stand up for the Constitution. Idaho’s U.S. House and U.S. Senate members – Sens. Risch and Crapo and Reps. Simpson and Fulcher – know Trump is trampling over the Constitution, but they don’t have the courage to protest, being much more interested in maintaining their political offices. Thank Heaven for the First Amendment. 
Another Indivisible rally is scheduled for 2,200 communities throughout America on Oct. 18, including Boise, Idaho Falls, Hailey, Moscow, Pocatello, and Twin Falls. I’ll be speaking at the one in Twin Falls. Many concerned, civic-minded folks will attend.
Trump’s obedient sycophants, like U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, have condemned those who are concerned by Trump’s march to despotism. Johnson called the upcoming rally a “hate America rally” of the “antifa, pro-Hamas crowd and the Marxists.” 
That’s quite a mix and match of ideologies and dead wrong on all counts.
It is interesting how antifa, an ideology that opposes fascism, always manages to get woven into the MAGA worldview as the root of all evil. It is not an organization and does not hold meetings or carry out sinister actions. Even if it were an actual group, the idea of opposing fascism is not really obnoxious, unless you happen to be a fascist. Mussolini would have tried to stamp them out.
Nevertheless, Donald Trump has had it in for antifa for many years. During his first term, Trump said he would be “designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization” for allegedly inciting violence during Black Lives Matter protests. A June 2020 protest in Spokane sparked a panic in Coeur d’Alene when false rumors spread about an antifa invasion of North Idaho. 
Armed citizens lined the streets to fight off the ideology. Not a single antifan materialized.  As far as anyone knows, Trump has not yet been able to produce a picture of an antifan or antifa gathering, making them as elusive as the Northern Sasquatch.
But, even if antifa were not more than just a way of thinking, why shouldn’t those who hate fascism have the right to think and speak their beliefs under the First Amendment? Trump seems to think they should be rounded up and punished. What could be a more clearcut violation of free speech rights?
The idea that America should not return to rule by a king, be it Trump or some other wannabe monarch, will be revisited on the 250th commemoration of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 2025. I pray that he will not have managed, with his 10,000 more ICE agents funded by the Big Beautiful Billionaires Bill, to impose his vision of a kingship on our beloved democratic republic. 
With the good work of Indivisible and other American patriotic organizations, we might well survive as a free nation.

Cindy Hyde-Smith, said he would largely side with Democratic leaders in the current partisan dispute that has the federal government shut down and has pitted Senate Democrats against President Donald Trump. 
While campaigning in Jackson on Oct. 11 at Jackson State University’s homecoming game, Colom told Mississippi Today that if he were a U.S. senator from Mississippi, he would pressure congressional leaders to reach a deal on health insurance costs alongside an agreement to fund the government. 
At the heart of the government shutdown fight is a dispute over extending expiring subsidies that help people buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Colom said this is “common sense policy” for Mississippi. 
Hyde-Smith, Mississippi’s former agriculture commissioner and a former state senator, has voted with the Republican leadership in favor of funding the government, but punts the issues of the health insurance subsidies.  
She wrote on social media that Democratic senators were putting on a “political show” by not agreeing to pass a bill to fund the government without promised protections for the subsidies. 

If the subsidies are not extended before the end of the year, the cost of insurance will go up on average $480 annually for an estimated 285,000 Mississippians on the federal health exchange, according to KFF, a national nonprofit health care research organization. The premiums would increase significantly for some Mississippians.

Participation in the marketplace by Mississippians has increased 242% in recent years since the enhanced federal assistance program was enacted, according to KFF, and Mississippi has one of the highest percentages of residents who don’t have health insurance. 
Some Republicans argue that Congress should debate the subsidies once the government is funded, but most Democratic senators have said they should act urgently to extend them because they will expire in the coming months. 
Colom, like most of the current Democratic senators, said the deal on funding the government should happen concurrently with an agreement over the subsidies because less affluent Mississippians would suffer without the extra government assistance.
“It has to be at the same time,” Colom said. “We have to do it at the same time.” 
Colom, the current district attorney in the Golden Triangle area, also criticized Hyde-Smith for not using her close relationship with Trump to negotiate a deal on the subsidies or the shutdown.

“Why do we have a senator who is constantly giving away her voice?” Colom said of Hyde-Smith. “Why isn’t she in the negotiating room?” 

“Democrats have repeatedly refused a clean, bipartisan bill to reopen the government,” Hyde-Smith said. “Everyday Americans are beginning to feel the pain, and it will only get worse as this unnecessary Democratic shutdown continues. This did not have to happen.” 
The U.S. government shut down on Oct. 1, and federal lawmakers have been unable to reach an agreement for three weeks now on how to fund and reopen it.

There are almost 1.1 million licensed physicians in the United States. That may sound like a lot, but the country has struggled for decades to train enough physicians to meet its needs – and, in particular, to provide care in rural and underserved communities.
Foreign-born physicians have long filled that gap, reducing the overall national shortage and signing up to practice in often overlooked regions and specialties. Today, 1 in 5 doctors licensed to practice in the U.S. were born and trained in another country.
But the ability of physicians from other countries to obtain work in the U.S. may be threatened by the Trump administration’s aims of limiting foreign workers. In September, Trump issued a proclamation requiring employers sponsoring foreign-born workers through a type of work visa called an H-1B to pay a fee of US$100,000 to the government. The White House has signaled doctors may be exempt but has not clarified its position.
As a physician and professor who studies the intersection of business and medicine, I believe increasing restrictions on H-1B visas for physicians may exacerbate the physician shortage. To grasp why that is, it’s important to understand how foreign-trained doctors became such an integral part of U.S. health care – and the role they play today.
 
The roots of today’s physician shortage

	The Association of American Medical Colleges, a trade association representing U.S. medical schools, estimates there will be a deficit of about 86,000 physicians in the country by 2036.
The roots of this shortage stretch back more than a century. In 1910, a landmark study called the Flexner Report detailed significant inconsistencies in the quality of education at American medical schools. The report resulted in the closure of over half the country’s medical schools, winnowing their numbers down from 148 to 66 over two decades.
As a result, the number of doctors in the U.S. declined until new training programs emerged. Between 1960 and 1980, 40 new medical schools launched with the help of federal funding. In 1980, a congressionally mandated assessment deemed the problem solved, but by the early 2000s, a physician shortage emerged once more. In 2006, the American Association of Medical Colleges called for raising medical school enrollment by 30%.
Growth in medical school enrollment hit that target in the late 2010s, but even so, the U.S. still lacks enough medical graduates to fill yearslong training programs, called residencies, that early-career physicians must complete to become fully qualified to practice.
Especially lacking are primary care physicians – particularly in rural areas, where there are one-third as many physicians per capita as in urban areas.
 
Opportunities for foreign-born doctors

	Even as the U.S. built up medical school enrollment in the 1960s and 1970s, the government joined other countries such as the U.K. and Canada in creating immigration policies that drew physicians from developing countries to practice in underserved areas. Between 1970 and 1980, their numbers grew sharply, from 57,000 to 97,000.
Foreign-born and -trained physicians have remained a key pillar of the U.S. medical system. In recent years, the majority of those physicians have come from India and Pakistan. Citizens of Canada and Middle Eastern countries have added significantly to that count, as well. Most arrive in the U.S. as trainees in residency programs through one of two main visa programs.
The majority come on J-1 visas, which allow physicians to enter the U.S. for training but require them to return to their home country for at least two years when their training is complete. Those who wish to remain in the U.S. to practice must transition to an H-1B visa.
A small percentage of physicians come to the U.S. on H-1Bs from the start.
H-1B visas are employer-sponsored temporary work permits that allow foreign-born, highly skilled workers to obtain U.S. employment. Employers directly petition the government on behalf of visa applicants, certifying that a foreign worker will be paid a similar wage to U.S. workers and will not adversely affect the working conditions of Americans.
Several programs sponsor H-1B visas for physicians, though the most common requires a three-year commitment to work in an underserved area after completing their training.
 
Foreign physicians fill a crucial need

	In 2025, foreign-trained medical graduates filled 9,700 of the nearly 40,000 training positions. Of those, roughly one-third were actually U.S. citizens who attended medical schools in other countries, with the remainder being foreign citizens seeking more training in the U.S.
After residency, these doctors frequently practice in precisely the geographic areas where the physician shortage is most severe. A nationwide survey of international medical graduates found that two-thirds practice in regions that the federal government has designated as lacking sufficient access to health care.
These doctors also occupy a disproportionate number of primary care positions. In a sample of 15,000 physicians who accepted new jobs in one year, foreign-born doctors were nine times more likely to enter primary care specialties. In 2025, 33.3% of internal medicine, 20.4% of pediatric and 17.6% of family medicine training positions were filled by physicians trained in other countries.
 
Who will pay?
Approximately 8,000 foreign-born physicians received H-1B visas in 2024. The new requirement of a $100,000 sponsorship fee would hit hardest for hospitals, health systems and clinics in areas of the country most significantly affected by the physician shortage.
These organizations are already under economic strain due to increasing labor costs and Medicare payments that have not kept pace with inflation. Dozens of these hospitals have closed in recent years, and many currently do not make enough money to support their operations.
On Sept. 25, 2025, 57 physician organizations cosigned a letter petitioning Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to waive the new application fee for physicians.
Already, however, the new rule may be having a chilling effect. Despite years of annual growth in the number of foreign-born applicants to U.S. physician training programs, 2025 has seen a nearly 10% drop. If the new H-1B fee is applied to physicians, the number is likely to keep falling.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)Five years ago, on the second floor of Teachers College Hall at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, my wife and I took turns rocking our 1-year-old son while we pored over our laptops. My doctoral studies in the Department of Educational Administration were in full swing.
Amid the chaos of dissertation drafts and grant proposals, Educational Administration faculty didn’t just teach — they became family. Without them, I wouldn’t have had the support to graduate and become a professor of educational leadership at North Dakota State University.
Yet Nebraska’s Educational Administration department — the only Ph.D.-granting educational leadership program in the state — faces dire cuts that would hurt not just Ph.D. students, but also schools and students throughout the state.
On Sept. 12, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Rodney Bennett announced a $27.5 million budget cut to address a $21 million deficit, plus $6.5 million in proactive cuts. This proposal would eliminate the Educational Administration Department entirely, resulting in the loss of 17 faculty and staff positions and the termination of key doctoral programs, including the Ph.D./Ed.D. in educational studies and the Ed.D. in educational administration.
Cutting the department accounts for $1.95 million of those savings. But it would come at a great cost. The department serves over 300 graduate students each year, delivering thousands of credit hours of instruction last academic year alone. It has strong retention and completion rates that outpace broader higher ed trends. These hours net the university $383 per credit hour from in-state students — a sizable contribution to UNL, in addition to grants that faculty obtain.
Alums like me — a lifelong Husker and four-time alum — fan out across Nebraska and beyond. Many serve in leadership roles for their school districts as principals and superintendents. Others pursue careers in higher education as faculty, impacting policy and research.
One such person, a close friend and recent graduate of the program, is a rural principal in Nebraska. When we talked about the department being closed, he explained that the biggest issue he saw would be the lack of understanding of the importance of research in driving practice in schools. Many school practices rely on experience rather than new ideas. Strong research programs help schools use more innovative approaches that better prepare students for careers.
Zoom out, and the ripple effects worsen. The U.S. faces a dire shortage of school leaders. Qualified principals can boost student achievement by up to 25%, reduce teacher turnover in high-need areas and champion policies that break down barriers for students to ensure everyone can succeed.
In Nebraska’s rural areas, where districts already struggle to attract talent, the Educational Administration Department has been a homegrown solution, producing leaders who understand Cornhusker State realities from small school mergers to choice in curricula. Without the department, students will lose out on leaders who learned how to make difficult choices and enhance the lives of students and teachers.
To be clear, budgets often involve difficult decisions. Over the past five years, UNL has already trimmed $75 million from its budget amid stagnant state funding and enrollment pressures. But targeting the Educational Administration Department is a quick fix that will backfire. Its metrics, vibrant enrollment and high-impact research demonstrate its value to taxpayers and the community.
Rather than cut the department, the budget committee might explore other alternatives in the plan, such as using some of the projected $17.25 million saved from administrative reorganizations and voluntary resignations to maintain the Educational Administration Department, leaving a surplus of $15.35 million.
Nebraska deserves the opportunity for every aspiring educator to enroll in a program that has high standards and high involvement. If the goal is to increase tuition revenue and state appropriations, cutting a department as pivotal as this one won’t work.
Even the threat of eliminating the department is detrimental to future success, as future students are significantly less likely to enroll in a program they believe might be eliminated.
Moreover, as a land-grant, flagship university, UNL’s mandate is to enhance Nebraska’s public good, with a focus on education at the forefront. Seen in that light, maintaining the Educational Administration Department is mission-critical.
Erasing the department that trains leaders and educators sends the wrong message: When times get tight, we turn our backs on the very systems that help hold our communities together.

(Photo provided by the Alaska National Guard)After the latest catastrophic storm hit Western Alaska, displacing more than 1,500 people, killing at least one and leaving villages in ruins, residents face an existential crisis. 
Will the wide delta that fans out between the lower Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers and has supported one of the circumpolar north’s largest Indigenous populations for millennia continue to be a place where Alaska’s Yupik people can live?
One elder has his doubts.
“We’re not going to be well. Storms are going to get worse, and it’s not going to be livable,” said Mike Williams Sr., a tribal leader from the Kuskokwim River village of Akiak. “We’re past the tipping point, maybe.”
Fairbanks-based scientist Torre Jorgenson, who has studied the region for decades, has doubts as well.
Intertwined climate change forces make long-term prospects grim in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, according to a wide-ranging scientific study he led. The study was published in mid-August, just two months before the remnants of Typhoon Halong hit on Oct. 12. 
Coastal erosion, permafrost thaw, sea-level rise, intrusion of saltwater into freshwater systems – are combining with storm surges to dramatically transform the coastal area, damaging communities and the food resources that have sustained Yup’ik people for centuries, the study said.
Of the 18 villages on the outer coastal area of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, at least 10 will likely have to be relocated, said Jorgenson, who is affiliated with the University of Alaska Fairbanks while operating an independent science consulting company.
The at-risk villages sit atop permafrost that, when intact, is a platform a meter or two above the region’s salt marshes, Jorgenson said. That permafrost is no longer intact, and it will likely disappear in the next two to three decades, he said.
“So the ground is going down, and the water is coming up, and they’ll be unlivable,” he said
If those villages move, they will follow the lead of Newtok. The village of about 350 escaped erosion and flooding by moving farther inland to a site called Mertarvik, but the effort took decades and is still challenged by infrastructure problems.
Williams, of Akiak, said it is not easy for coastal villages to find suitable relocation spots. “Even though they head toward higher ground, there’s a lot of wind in the higher ground,” he said.

	But some residents of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok are determined to stay and rebuild, and others who evacuated to return. 
“We will go back, because it’s our home,” said Missy Chuckwuk of Kipnuk, waiting in line to board an evacuation flight in Bethel on Wednesday, with her husband and their three children. Once freeze-up hits, the community will begin to move homes back that floated away, she said.
An estimated 50 to 100 people stayed and did not evacuate from Kipnuk, according to a representative with the Alaska National Guard, and 200 to 300 people in Kwigillingok. 
Jorgenson said necessary action in the most at-risk villages will be expensive.
“They can do kind of short-term adaptation, but over the period of decades, they are going to be looking at having to relocate, and there’s going to be a huge, enormous cost to that,” he said. Newtok’s relocation cost hundreds of millions of dollars, he noted. “And if you’re looking at 10 or more villages that have to move, who’s going to come up with the money for that?”
Combined climate change forces amplify each other
For the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, the connected climate change forces include sea ice retreat. It erases the frozen barrier that prevented waves from reaching shore during late-fall and winter storms. By the end of the century, Jorgenson said, the ice-free season in the Bering Sea will last approximately 8.5 months, with ice forming two months later in the fall and melting a month earlier in the spring, he said.
Bering Sea residents already got a taste of the future in 2018, he said, when winter ice was scarcer than at any time in the past 150 years of records.
Storm surges and floods enhance permafrost thaw, Jorgenson said. Saltwater pushed ashore kills tundra plants that make up an insulating mat, thus allowing more heat to penetrate the surface and thaw yet more permafrost.
Beyond damaging homes and villages, the changes hurt people’s ability to gather wild food in their traditional ways, Jorgensen said.
Earlier sea ice melt exposes coastal regions to more flooding in the critical spring nesting season time for migratory birds that are residents’ sources of eggs and meat, Jorgenson said. Saltwater intrusion is changing habitat for migrating birds that use the region, which is a major nesting and breeding site for several species. Saltwater intrusion also contaminates drinking water supplies. Permafrost thaw undermines the once-stable areas that have been long used for traditional hunting camps and that have produced wild food, he said.

	“These permafrost plateaus are really very rich areas,” he said. “Those have been really important berry picking areas, and those are going to disappear pretty soon.”
The origins of this fall’s storm, like Merbok three years ago, lie far to the west, in the North Pacific Ocean. There, water has become hotter; a new marine heatwave is currently underway. The ocean heat amplifies seasonal storms that reach Alaska, like Typhoon Halong and the Typhoon Merbok, which sent destructive floods and high winds across the region in 2022.
While Merbok formed in a part of the ocean that is normally too cool to produce typhoons and Halong formed in a more standard ocean spot, both storms picked up intensity from unusual North Pacific heat, said Rick Thoman, a scientist with the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Preparedness at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
“Passing over near or at-record warm sea surface temperatures outside of the tropics, that’s something that both of those storms have in common,” Thoman said.
Such ocean heat will not always be present, but it is likely to be more frequent, he said. “The trend is going only one way,” he said.
People of the Yukon-Kuskokwim recognize the trend.
Alaska Federation of Natives co-chair Ana Hoffman, in her opening address at the organization’s annual convention on Thursday, spoke directly to her fellow Yup’ik people about it, hundreds of whom had been evacuated by then to Anchorage.
“You were at the forefront of this recent storm and endured what is now becoming a new reality here: typhoons in the Arctic,” she said.
Climate change threats in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and other parts of rural Alaska have long been recognized by state and federal government agencies and by state and regional organizations like the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta Subsistence Regional Advisory Council.
Wiliams said there have been warnings for several decades. Speaking during a break Tuesday in this week’s Elders and Youth Conference in Anchorage, he said he remembers listening to elders talk 50 years ago about the big changes to come.
“They said, ‘The weather is going to be changing, and we’re going to have more frequent storms, and it’s going to get warmer,’” he said,

	Those predictions come true, Williams said.
“We used to have seven feet of ice on the river; now it’s three feet. And the permafrost is going away pretty fast. Tundra communities are sinking,” he said.
State Sen. Lyman Hoffman, who has represented Western Alaska for four decades, attested to similar observations.
“There has been more and more warming that is disrupting lives in the Y-K Delta,” the Bethel Democrat said at a Monday news conference held by Gov. Mike Dunleavy.
Alaska House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, said the latest storm should be seen as a call to action.
“We know this is not going to be, unfortunately, the last typhoon,” Edgmon said in his address Friday at the Alaska Federation of Natives Conference. “We need to be very conscious about living in a  state with a changing climate.” That is necessary for “a future that doesn’t involve waking up in the middle of the night and having water come up from your floor and 100-mile-an-hour winds and your house floating off somewhere,” he said.
Trump administration cuts
The Trump administration, however, does not share that perspective.
The administration canceled previously awarded grants intended to prevent damages in rural Alaska from disasters that have been exacerbated by climate change – including a $20 million grant for coastal erosion control in Kipnuk, a village of about 700 that was one of the communities hardest hit by ex-typhoon Halong.
The Kipnuk grant was among several awarded during the Biden administration to rural Alaska communities under the Environmental Protection Agency’s Community Change Grant Program. The grants were for work like permafrost and shoreline protection, renewable energy development and permafrost protection.
Trump administration officials characterized those projects as unnecessary projects. In a post on the social media site X, EPA Administrator Lee Zelden called them “wasteful DEI and Environmental Justice grants.”
EPA officials defended the cut.
“The ‘environmental justice’ funding cancelled by EPA would not have prevented or safeguarded the community from the mass destruction and tragedy caused by such a large and devastating typhoon,” Brigit Hirsch, the agency’s press secretary, said by email on Friday.

	Administration cuts to the National Weather Service, part of broader cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, likely had an effect on the weather forecast and interfered with  preparations for ex-Typhoon Halong’s impacts in Alaska.
Thoman said predictions for Halong’s path into Alaska, made after Trump administration cuts forced reductions in rural Alaska weather staff and monitoring, were not as accurate as those for Merbok in 2022. Atmospheric observations from weather balloons have been cut in Kotzebue, Bethel, St. Paul and Cold Bay, and technical problems prevented the normal launches in Nome, he noted. “It’s almost inconceivable that that lack of upper-air observations had no effect,” he said.
The Government Accounting Office has already identified National Weather Service cuts as a problem. The shortage of meteorologists has created a need for “urgent action” to protect aviation safety, said a GAO report issued on Aug. 28.
Also axed by the Trump administration was a Federal Emergency Management Agency program aimed at preventing disaster damage; a statement from the agency called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program “wasteful and ineffective,” even though earlier analysis found it saved $6 in response cost for every $1 in preparation spending.
Overall, Trump administration cuts to FEMA have undermined the agency’s ability to respond to disasters that are increasing in frequency, according to a Sept. 2 GAO report. FEMA has lost about a tenth of its staff, compromising its capabilities, and there are similar concerns about disaster responses at the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, the GAO said.
In the short term, Alaska Native organizations were waiting this week for FEMA assistance. Resolutions passed by the Association of Village Council Presidents, a group of Yup’ik tribal governments, and the Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corp., the largest tribal health provider for the region, and other groups have requested a presidential disaster declaration and the aid that comes with it.
Gov. Dunleavy on Thursday sent a formal request for a presidential declaration, not just for the Yukon-Kuskokwim area but also for northwestern Alaska, which was lashed days earlier by remnants of the typhoon.
As of Friday, the disaster response was being led by the state, according to a FEMA statement. But opportunities for immediate action beyond evacuations and temporary shelter were limited.
“There is very little time to do anything, like even dry stuff out at this point,” Thoman said. “Winter is nigh.”

Dan Sullivan during his address on Friday to the Alaska Federation of Natives.
Several demonstrators stood and turned their backs to the senator as he spoke, and some held signs reading “Medicaid matters” and “Public radio saves lives.”

Sullivan did not acknowledge the protesters or stop speaking during a roughly half hour of remarks to the ballroom of attendees. The three-day conference in Anchorage is the largest representative gathering of Native peoples in the state, drawing roughly 6,000 people each year. 
Protesters stood on behalf of a variety of issues. Some were residents of the community of Ambler, some advocates and supporters, all opposing the proposed Ambler Road, a 211-mile road to a mining district, recently advanced by the Trump administration with the support of Sullivan.
“Crossing hundreds of streams, it will affect everything,” said Teresa Clarke, executive director of the Yukon River Inter-tribal Watershed Council, a coalition representing 74 tribes and First Nations from Canada, opposing the proposed development, saying it risks environmental degradation.
“We’re already affected by extreme weather events, as we’ve realized this past week, and those types of events will probably speed up more extreme events and then degradation, melting of more permafrost, it will affect the animals, and everything,” she said, referring to severe storms that have devastated coastal communities.

Following the event, Amanda Coynce, a spokesperson for Sullivan, responded to the protest repeating the senators positions on Medicaid and public radio, and saying “Senator Sullivan welcomes respectful debate. He listens to all Alaskans on Ambler.”
Aubrey Weber, executive director of the non-profit advocacy group 907 Initiative, criticized Sullivan’s refusal to hold public events or town halls this year after his support of the Trump administration. 
“​​Well, this is the only public event he’s done all year, and the public has been routinely, repeatedly asking him to show up and hear from constituents,” Weber said. “And he’s pretty quick to go to a private event with donors, you know, something that’s maybe $500 a plate, but he’s not coming and talking to Alaskans. And so this is one of the very few opportunities that we had to voice our opinions.”
Weber was among those who stood to protest Sullivan’s support of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” the Trump administration’s landmark legislation advancing the conservative blueprint for government known as Project 2025 that passed this summer. It included tax cuts as well as cuts to social services like Medicaid and funding for public media.

“The simple fact of the matter, standing up here and saying nobody’s getting cut from Medicaid is a lie, because you cannot take a trillion dollars from the federal Medicaid budget, give those to millionaires and billionaires in the form of tax cuts and then open up this $50 billion rural health care fund. You know, one of those numbers is much bigger than the other,” he said.
Weber said the proposed cuts to Medicaid — and health insurance premium tax credits being bitterly debated during the federal government shutdown — will hurt Alaskans and the health care system, and he urged the senator to support funding and re-opening the federal government.
“Listen to Alaskans. Do what’s right for Alaskans,” he said. “Stop being a yes man for party bosses and stand up for your constituents.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSCF8622-scaled-e1760759733717-1024x619.jpg,,,2025-10-17 23:57:00.995874

(Photo by Josh Kurtz/Maryland Matters)The U.S. Department of Transportation showed an alarming disregard for the nation’s security a few weeks ago by clawing back a $47.3 million grant intended to launch a new era of steel production at Sparrows Point.
Members of our union, the United Steelworkers (USW), are profoundly disappointed by the Trump administration’s abandonment of a project primed to create jobs, boost manufacturing capacity and meet our country’s growing energy needs.
But it’s important to emphasize that the government’s turnabout represents only a setback, not the end of this forward-looking initiative.
The USW and our partner, US Wind, remain committed to bringing steel back to Baltimore and injecting new life into Sparrows Point. We’re confident that this site, once the home of the largest steel mill in the world, has yet another pivotal role to play in America’s future.
The USW and US Wind joined forces about four years ago. We intend to use a portion of the mill property to build monopiles — the huge foundations sunk into the seabed to support wind turbines — through a new company called Sparrows Point Steel.

Over the full scope of US Wind’s offshore projects, the company will consume more than 330,000 metric tons of steel plate, a huge boon to the steel industry. This is directly in line with the Trump administration’s stated goal of building more in America — and makes the administration’s cancellation of the grant all the more puzzling.
Current projections call for Sparrows Point Steel to employ more than 500 USW members in production, maintenance and a variety of other roles. We’re talking about good-paying, middle-class jobs that enable workers to support their families and lift up the entire community.
Our commitment to building out the wind energy supply chain means sourcing not only our steel plate but many other kinds of materials and supplies from domestic producers. In all, workers from nearly 50 companies across Maryland will benefit from vendor relationships with Sparrows Point Steel.
On top of that, US Wind intends to establish an operations and maintenance center at the harbor in West Ocean City. This facility will coordinate turbine and substation maintenance for offshore wind developments, creating still more jobs in the manufacturing, maritime and energy sectors.
But there’s more. While catalyzing the economy, the Sparrows Point project simultaneously strengthens our national security.
Our work will help to position America as the leader in a global, evolving industry. It will also help to deliver a more reliable energy supply at a time of growing demand and more frequent disruptions in the power grid resulting from climate change.
Marylanders get this.
A recent poll found that seven out of 10 respondents support the construction of wind projects off the Maryland coast because of their potential to stabilize energy prices, enhance the nation’s energy supply and reduce pollution.
The respondents’ support cut across political lines, underscoring the high stakes. What’s more, 81% opposed the reversal of offshore wind projects already underway out of concern for job losses, according to the survey, conducted by Turn Forward, a nonprofit supporting wind energy.
Sparrows Point is hallowed ground for the USW.
At one time, tens of thousands of union members worked here, producing the steel that built the middle class, fueled prosperity and made America a superpower.
We now have an opportunity to build on that legacy — to harness manufacturing and energy for a stronger future.
With or without federal support, USW members will do what we always do. Alongside our partners at US Wind, we’ll get the job done.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/20210803_104844-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-18 05:56:22.755405

(File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Maryland will not be able to enforce part of a 2021 law that allowed it to obscure the costs of a digital ad tax from consumers who were paying it.
The order — which will not be appealed by the state — strikes down one portion of the first-of-its-kind tax on digital advertising within the state. That provision prohibited online companies from alerting consumers to the tax, by passing it on to them as a surcharge, fee or line item on their bills.
Opponents of the law had said that it required them to collect the tax but prohibited them from telling customers where the tax came from — shielding lawmakers who approved the tax from criticism, and violating the businesses’ free speech rights, they said.
U.S. District Court Judge Lydia Kay Griggsby, in a one-page order Wednesday, issued a declaratory judgement in favor of the tech industry that had sued to block the tax, saying the targeted provision of the law “facially violates the First Amendment.”
Griggsby permanently barred the state from enforcing that provision, but left the digital advertising tax in place, for now.
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore), a sponsor of the 2021 bill, did not respond to a request for comment Friday. A spokesperson for the Office of the Comptroller said the office has Griggsby’s final order under review.
Appeals court rules provision of digital ad tax violates First Amendment protections

The case is just one of several challenges brought by NetChoice, a trade group representing large technology and social media companies, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA).
A challenge to the tax itself remains open in Maryland Tax Court. The case was filed by big tech firms, including Apple and Meta. The state has collected nearly $419 million from the tax since 2022, according to the Office of the Comptroller.
An official with the NetChoice Litigation Center called Griggsby’s order “a victory for free speech, political discourse and internet freedom.”
“The Fourth Circuit was clear: states cannot shield themselves from criticism by preventing companies from highlighting the consequences of a new policy,” Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, said in a statement.
“Businesses will finally be able to see that Maryland’s policies are directly impacting their bottom line. And Maryland will have to reckon with that,” Taske said.
Griggsby’s order comes two months after a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the provision violated the First Amendment. The panel sent the case back to Griggsby, who in 2024 had sided with the plaintiffs — a group of tech firms and business associations — that the law created some First Amendment issues. Even so, she allowed the law to stand because the offending provision had “many constitutional applications.”
The 2021 law targets big tech firms including Apple, Meta, and Google.
Under the law, companies reporting gross global annual revenue of at least $100 million are subject to a 2.5% levy. The tax increases in increments of 2.5% to a maximum rate of 10% levied against companies reporting more than $15 billion in gross global revenue.
The state could collect as much as $250 million annually from the digital ad tax, according to a legislative analysis. The funds are earmarked for the state’s education reform program.

The sharply worded July ruling invoked American protests against the Colonial-era Stamp Act. Circuit Judge Julius Richardson, in that ruling, wrote “complaining about taxes remains a grand American political tradition.”
The questioned provision in the tax bill was intended to shield lawmakers from public criticism. The provision went too far, Richardson wrote.
“Perhaps fearing such complaints, Maryland paired its tax with another rule,” Richardson wrote for the court. “Companies that make money advertising on the internet must not only pay the tax, but avoid telling their customers how it affects pricing: No line items, no surcharges, no fees.”
The court’s ruling noted that elected officials might have a reason for such a provision, but “keeping out of hot water with voters” cannot be a justification.
“If companies pass on the cost of the tax, they must do so in silence — keeping customers in the dark about why prices have gone up and thereby insulating Maryland from political responsibility,” he wrote.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Greenbelt-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-18 04:56:41.237867

(File photo by Sam Gauntt/Maryland Matters)The University System of Maryland Board of Regents held a special, closed-door meeting Friday afternoon to review “an athletics-related contract under consideration,” an apparent reference to a $2 billion offer to buy a stake in the Big Ten athletic conference.
The board immediately went into a closed session to discuss “confidential commercial and financial information” with its attorneys, according to the board agenda. It met for about an hour before leaving without taking any public action.
The 4 p.m. meting was called on short notice.
“The board has been informed that the Big Ten Conference member institutions, which include the University of Maryland, will be voting in the next few days on a proposal that may have board implications,” Board Chair Linda Gooden said a few minutes before the closed session. “Given the short notice, we have requested to meet and seek legal advice and legal counsel on the board’s role and authority regarding this matter.”
The board is responsible for overseeing academic and financial operations and crafting policy for the 12 institutions and three regional higher education centers in the university system. That includes the College Park campus, the state’s flagship institution.
According to published reports, officials at the Big Ten Conference are negotiating a more than $2 billion deal with UC Investments, which manages the University of California Pension System investment fund, for a 10% stake in the conference over the next 20 years. The conference’s athletic departments would each get a share of the money from UC Investments, which would get 10% of conference revenues in return.
Universities told they should brace for the coming year’s 7% budget cut

Money generated would include sponsorships, media rights and league revenue streams for the 18 schools in the conference, which stretches from Maryland and Rutgers on the East Coast to the University of Southern California, the University of California Los Angeles and the University of Washington on the West Coast, with traditional heartland rivals in between.
But not everyone is on board with the idea.
U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) sent a letter to the conference’s school presidents, including an Oct. 10 letter to University of Maryland, College Park, President Darryll J. Pines, warning that a deal with a private investor may require the sale of university assets and affect the schools’  tax-exempt statuses.
“The primary goal of these companies is to make money for the firm, which is unlikely to align with the academic goals of your university or its obligations as a not-for-profit organization,” Cantwell wrote. “These investors will be focused on maximizing their investment, not on preserving and growing athletic and academic opportunities for student athletes.”
A spokesperson with the College Park campus said in an email Friday evening the school would need more time to comment on the negotiations.
Higher education officials from at least one state, the Michigan Board of Regents, reject the idea of a private equity firm dippinng not in college sports, according to the Detroit Free Press.
On that same day that  Michigan officials discussed the proposal Thursday, the Big Ten Conference released a statement on behalf of the league’s presidents and chancellors defending the negotiations.
“Over a year ago, we instructed the conference to undertake a comprehensive process, alongside our members, to innovate for the future and extend the conference’s legacy of academic and athletic excellence,” according to the statement. “The Big Ten remains committed to modernizing the operations of our conference, strengthening conference stability, preserving Olympic and women’s sports, and enhancing the student-athlete experience.”
The statement noted that UC Investments would be “a non-profit partner – not private equity.”
“Ultimately, it is the decision of the Big Ten member institutions’ presidents and chancellors to decide if it’s the right opportunity and those conversations are ongoing,” the statement said.

Wes Moore speaks at a federal government shutdown resource fair in Howard County on Friday. (Photo by Nicole Pilsbury/Maryland Matters)On day 17 of the government shutdown, furloughed Defense Department contractor Glenda Lassiter found herself at a federal government shutdown resource fair in Howard County, looking through loan and insurance information offered to affected federal workers.
“I am here in the event that I do need it [resources] — hopefully I don’t,” she said. “I extend prayers to those that do.”
Lassiter is among the 200,000 federal contractors and 260,000 federal workers in Maryland who are facing the burdens and the uncertainty of a government shutdown. Most workers were sent home after Congress could not agree on a budget by Oct. 1, when fiscal year 2026 started, while others have to continue showing up for work, but aren’t getting paid.
State and local governments have been offering services and resources to help residents affected by the shutdown, including Gov. Wes Moore’s announcement Friday that the Maryland Transit Administration would offer federal workers free rides on commuter buses and MARC trtains for the duration of the shutdown.
“You are not going to have to worry about your transportation because this [Trump] administration can’t figure it out,” said Moore, who visited tables at the fair and talked to workers.

The state had previously offered protections on housing and utilities, such as gas and electric, for furloughed workers, and Moore said Friday that utility companies are “holding to their pledge” of pausing shutoffs for federal workers during the shutdown.
The resource fair had tables with unemployment insurance and loan information from both the state and from banks like Truist and Fulton. Resume reviews and critique stations were offered to support workers looking for new jobs.
Health care assistance was present through United Healthcare and Blue Cross Blue Shield, stationed next to tables for Maryland agencies like the Department of Human Services, the Department of Veterans and Military Families and the Department of Labor.
“You see so many people working here because they are afraid of how they’re going to put food on their tables, how they’re going to keep a roof over their heads, how they’re going to care for their families,” Howard County Executive Calvin Ball said at the fair.
Ball assured the community that Maryland officials will continue to “fight for what’s right” among the challenges and negativity during the shutdown.
The governor said more than 2,000 people have applied for unemployment insurance because of the shutdown, and more than 1,000 have applied to the Federal Shutdown Loan Program, a $700 no-interest loan for excepted federal workers — those who work without pay during the shutdown.
Moore and Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) called on Congress to end the shutdown, with Moore saying he wants Washington to “see what we’re seeing and the real pain that it is causing.”
The House passed a stopgap budget in September to keep the government open until Nov. 21, while fuller budget discussions continued. But the bill stalled in the Senate, were Democrats are pushing their own bill that would retain subsidies for health insurance coverage that are set to expire at the end of the year — which could cause millions to lose health care, the Democrats argue.
Since then, neither side in the Senate has budged.
Elfreth said she is pushing for the government to come to an agreement that reopens the government and “does not risk health care for tens of millions of Americans.” She emphasized the importance of restoring citizen’s faith in government institutions and the idea that Congress is able to make progress.
“I have been … demanding that Democrats and Republicans do something radical, which is actually sit down at the table and come up with a bipartisan budget deal,” she said.

Sears/Maryland Matters)Colleagues from both sides of the aisle remembered Del. Charles Otto (R-Lower Shore) Friday for his kindness and humor, his knowledge on agricultural issues and his passionate advocacy for the Eastern Shore during his 14 years in the House of Delegates. It was announced Friday that Otto had died at age 61. No cause of death has been given.
Otto, who represented parts of Somerset, Wicomico and Worcester counties since he was first sworn in to the House of Delegates in 2011, had just filed for reelection to a fifth term on Tuesday, said Del. Jay Jacobs (R-Upper Shore).
“It’s a real shocker,” Jacobs said Friday. “He was a good friend of mine, I was lucky to be friends with him all these years – and I’ll miss him and I know that members of the legislature will miss him.”

Jacobs said he and Otto were “almost inseparable” in the General Assembly, both starting in the House in 2011 and representing parts of the Eastern Shore. The two were put on the same committee, Environment and Transportation, shared office space and worked on various agricultural issues during the last 14 years, Jacobs said.
“Everyone liked him, he was a likeable guy,” Jacobs said. “He had always had a good sense of humor. Never saw him get angry about anything – unless it had something to do with his district.”
Jacobs admitted that he and Otto were some of the more reserved members on the House floor, but spoke up in matters that were important to them and the Eastern Shore.
“We were quiet … If we stood up, which we did occasionally, I can tell you people paid attention because we didn’t do it very often,” Jacobs said. “If we did, you knew it was serious.”
House Republicans said in a joint statement that they were “devastated by the loss” of Otto.
“He was, in many ways, the heart of our Caucus,” the statement said. “A rarity in politics, Delegate Otto was never someone who was in love with his own voice. But when he spoke, he did so with heartfelt wisdom, and members listened, no matter their political party. He was unceasingly generous and hilariously funny.”
Senate Republicans called him a “steadfast voice for Maryland’s farmers, rural communities and small businesses.”
“Charles brought common sense and integrity to every discussion in Annapolis,” Senate Republicans said in a statement. “He worked across party lines to ensure that rural Maryland’s needs were heard and respected, and his leadership and friendship will be greatly missed by all who had the privilege to serve alongside him.”
Otto was born in Salisbury on Feb. 15, 1964. He attended University of Maryland Eastern Shore and graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University with a degree in animal Science in 1986.
He was a field representative for the Maryland Farm Bureau from 1987 through 1995 and continued other agricultural work throughout the years.
“As a farmer himself, he was firmly rooted in the agricultural community and faithfully served his lower shore constituents in the House of Delegates since 2011,” the Maryland Farm Bureau said in a statement Friday. “Delegate Otto was a steadfast champion for Maryland agriculture and will be sorely missed by his friends and colleagues throughout the state.”

He was elected to the House of Delegates in 2010, where he continued to push for agricultural issues on the Environment and Transportation committee, as well as various subcommittees.
“He served the Maryland House of Delegates with integrity and an unwavering dedication to the people of District 38A,” House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) said in a statement posted to social media. “I extend our heartfelt condolences to his family, loved ones, constituents, and staff. He will be sorely missed by all.”
Otto’s legislative seat will be filled by appointment: The three county Republican central committees in his district will meet to select a nominee, whose name will be forwarded to the governor, who makes the final decision.
In a statement, Gov. Wes Moore (D) said that Otto had “a fidelity to our state that could never waver, and a commitment to our people that could never fade.”
“This was a man who loved Maryland to his core,” Gov. Wes Moore (D) said in a statement, “fighting every day for his constituents and moving in good faith with partners in the General Assembly to deliver results.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_2060-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-17 23:02:05.418921

John Curtis believes his colleagues are not too far apart to approve his bipartisan-backed plan changing up wildfire management. 
“I think the odds are very, very high,” Curtis, a Republican, told reporters Friday when asked about the chances of the fire proposal reaching final passage.
The bill was a focus of Curtis’ annual Conservative Climate Summit. The Friday event came just three weeks after President Donald Trump called climate change a “con job” at the United Nations and as the administration plans to keep coal-fired power plants running to meet energy demands.

Curtis said he does not agree with the “demonization of fossil fuels” and believes the nation’s energy demands require multiple types of generation. 
Asked about the cancellation of $7.5 billion in clean energy projects, Curtis said, “I have concerns.”  
He said he’s not familiar with each project, “but I’ll come back to this: We need every electron we can get.” 
Over a video feed on Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright also addressed the canceled projects in a speech to attendees of the climate summit. 
“A lot of the stopping of funding of projects we’re working on right now have really been mutual decisions with the original applicants for them, that I think were counting on government support to continue on, you know, subsidized purchases of things that didn’t, that wouldn’t exist without subsidies,” Wright said. “We need things that will fly on their own.”
The National Resources Defense Council has said the projects were “crucial” for manufacturing and grid upgrades, and ending support for them will stall American innovation and competitiveness, raising costs for consumers, and further cementing our reliance on dirty fossil fuels.”

Some Republicans in Congress have shifted away from focusing on climate change, but Curtis said he’s still winning over support from those in his party who attend the yearly event. 
“Some of them come, and they fold their arms like that, and they’re very suspicious. And then by the end of the day, they go, ‘I get it’,’” he said, “and they realize that it’s been a mistake for Republicans to not be engaged, because we do, we care deeply about the Earth.”
Curtis is sponsoring the bipartisan fire legislation along with Sens. Alex Padilla of California and John Hickenlooper of Colorado, both Democrats, and fellow Republican Tim Sheehy of Montana. 
The wide-ranging bill would set up a Wildfire Intelligence Center, require evaluations of fireshed areas, and boost forest restoration funds, among other changes. Several environmental groups oppose the measure, saying it would open millions of acres of federal land to logging without allowing for scientific review or community input first.  
In its fourth year, the event brought together representatives from the energy industry, government and environmental groups, with conversations focused on emerging technology, 
the permitting process, employing local workers in new projects, and finding ways for industry and government to work together. Curtis said attendance topped 600. 
Part of the event focused on the future of “the future of conservative climate policy” — something Curtis said “absolutely” has a place in today’s world. 
“Look at the turnout today,” he said. “I would say absolutely, of course.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday “nuclear is going to become sexy again” and he sees Utah playing a part in a comeback as the nation tries to raise its energy output to feed demand from artificial intelligence. 
“We’re really going to see nuclear move again. Nuclear is going to become sexy again” Wright said, speaking by a video feed at Utah Sen. John Curtis’ Conservative Climate Summit in Salt Lake City.
Wright said tech companies operating large-scale data centers known as hyperscalers to power AI “really want to see nuclear happen,” and noted they’re investing in advancing nuclear technology.  
He said the country is making rapid progress in nuclear fusion, although experts have said the technology will not solve energy problems until the end of the decade or in the early 2030’s. 
President Donald Trump has signed executive orders this year intended to bring about a “nuclear renaissance,” and Wright used the same phrase Friday.  
“Utah absolutely is going to be a key part of that,” he said. 
With nuclear projects coming to Utah, Cox hopes for rural jobs, but that’s no easy task

Utah Republicans, including Gov. Spencer Cox, share the desire to develop nuclear technology in the state, passing legislation creating governing bodies to advance nuclear systems, appropriating $10 million to fund Cox’s nuclear energy regulations through Operation Gigawatt, and making deals with nuclear innovators. 
Cox has said he envisions the state as a home to dozens of small modular reactors. In the last six months, the state has signed an agreement with a company owned by Bill Gates to explore a Utah site for a new nuclear reactor and announced a partnership with another firm to bring an advanced reactor to Emery County. 
Asked if the Emery County project will get off the ground, Curtis told reporters at his conference Friday, “I don’t think we have a choice of it being a reality, the demands for energy are so high, we have to figure this out.
Carmen Valdez, senior policy associate with HEAL Utah, said she has concerns about possible radiation exposure in communities near nuclear facilities, along with the years that could lapse between public investment and the day a reactor’s up and running.
“We are a little concerned about hearing ‘making nuclear sexy again,’ because there’s a lot of not great things that come with that industry that are just being brushed aside,” Valdez said.  
Wright emphasized the plan to raise the nation’s energy output includes keeping coal-fired power plants running. 
“I’m also super excited about next-generation geothermal, and frankly, Utah is the leader in that,” he said, referencing an enhanced geothermal plant being built in Beaver County.

On Thursday, Gov. Mike Dunleavy formally requested a federal disaster declaration for parts of western and northwestern Alaska after a pair of devastating storms flooded Kotzebue and nearly destroyed a series of coastal villages on the Kuskokwim River delta.   
“It is anticipated that more than 1,500 Alaskans will be evacuated to our major cities, many of whom will not be able to return to their communities and homes for upwards of 18 months,” the request letter reads in part.
The disaster declaration would cover the Northwest Arctic Borough, Lower Yukon Regional Education Attendance Area and the Lower Kukokwim Regional Attendance Area, places hit by the remnants of Typhoon Halong.
“Due to the time, space, distance, geography and weather in the affected areas, it is likely that many survivors will be unable to return to their communities this winter,” the letter said, explaining that local and state officials are developing temporary housing plans “until permanent housing plans can be developed and executed over the next year.”



How to help
The Alaska Community Foundation is coordinating relief with multiple partner organizations and providing support as a central clearinghouse for financial aid.
The Association of Village Council Presidents, a group of Yup’ik tribal governments, is coordinating requests for support and donations across the region.  
GCI has donated $100,000 to that relief effort and is collecting relief supplies at stores in Anchorage, Wasilla and Fairbanks through Oct. 27.
In Anchorage, the Alaska Federation of Natives is collecting donated items during its ongoing conference.
Bethel Friends of Canines is collecting donations to charter flights and continue evacuation efforts for pets abandoned during refugee flights.



The state is requesting the federal government fully fund individual assistance and public assistance programs for 90 days.
In Anchorage, where many evacuees are expected to live temporarily, municipal officials waived their normal requirements in order to declare a disaster during a special meeting Friday afternoon.
“We have been told to prepare for up to 1,600 evacuees being relocated here,” said Anchorage Mayor Suzanne LaFrance. “We know at least 572 have arrived in the last two days, and more will be coming. It’s a huge undertaking to find emergency shelter for so many people, but we have so many amazing partners who have come to the table, and we take pride in doing our part.”
In a news conference after the meeting, municipal officials said they have opened the Egan Civic and Convention Center to evacuees. On Thursday night, 119 people slept there; the building has a capacity of between 400-600.
At the Alaska Airlines Center on the campus of the University of Alaska Anchorage, dozens of cots filled a space normally reserved for sports and concerts. 
Community rec centers are also available if additional space is needed, municipal officials said, and they’re working on long-term housing for evacuees.

She and other officials visited the Alaska Airlines Center to speak with the evacuees.
“Just to share a very hard story,” she said, recounting to the Anchorage Assembly a story she was told, “a grandfather had no choice but to walk in the storm in high waters, holding one grandchild and pulling another and fighting against the wind. He didn’t realize his own grandchild was face down in the water. She had passed out, so he raised her up and started shaking her, and she came to, and thankfully, they got to safety right away. There’s going to be more stories that are going to be shared,” Jimmie said. 
To date, the state has funded disaster recovery itself. No cost estimates have been published so far.
“Response and initial recovery costs associated with this disaster in rural, remote, and insular regions of Alaska are exponentially higher than a traditional response along the road system in the Lower 48 states not in the U.S. Arctic,” the letter said.
The letter also includes preliminary damage assessments. In Kipnuk, a community of 714 people that was the hardest-hit by the remnants of Typhoon Halong, “90 percent of all structures are destroyed, including critical infrastructure/lifeline facilities and residential structures.”
In Kwigillingok, a nearby village of 377 people, “35 percent of all structures are destroyed.”
At Napakiak, a village of 325 people, a quarter of all homes were shifted from their foundations by flooding, local officials told KYUK Public Media. Of those that didn’t drift, many were inundated and damaged.
Kotzebue and Deering, in northwest Alaska, were hit by a storm days before Halong’s remnants arrived. There, “more than 50 homes have been compromised, and emergency measures must be taken to rapidly repair homes to make them safe, sanitary, and habitable prior to winter,” according to the state’s federal disaster request.
The day after Dunleavy’s request, Alaska’s three-person congressional delegation sent a joint letter to President Donald Trump, urging him to approve the disaster declaration quickly.
Dunleavy was scheduled to tour the storm-hit region on Friday before returning to Anchorage for further work. 
Speaking to reporters in Bethel, Dunleavy said he’s heard from a lot of people asking what they can do to help.
“Donate money, donate your time, because that’s what we’re going to need right now,” the governor said. “Then, all of the agencies that we’re working with here in the region, here statewide, here federally, I think we’ve got the resources. We just need make sure we pull it all together like we have in other disasters. And I think people will start to see lights going on, houses being put back on their foundations, insulation dried out, and you’re going to see people moving back to their homes.”

,DC,2025-10-18 00:31:39+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Federal judge broadens order blocking Trump administration layoffs during shutdown,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-broadens-order-blocking-trump-administration-layoffs-during-shutdown,,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Friday clarified and broadened a temporary restraining order she issued earlier this week that blocks the Trump administration from laying off federal employees during the ongoing government shutdown. U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California Judge Susan Illston said during an emergency hearing the restraining order affects any agency that has employees who are members of the unions that brought the lawsuit or are in collective bargaining units.The Trump administration choosing not to recognize those union activities based on an earlier executive order doesn’t mean an agency can issue layoff notices, she said. Illston, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, specifically said the departments of Interior and Health and Human Services must comply with the TRO and cannot issue Reductions in Force, or RIFs. “It is not complicated,” Illston said. “During this time these agencies should not be doing RIFs of the protected folks that we're talking about.” She also added the National Federation of Federal Employees, Service Employees International Union and National Association of Government Employees, Inc. to the lawsuit and the temporary restraining order. Meanwhile, as the shutdown that began Oct. 1 extends with no end in sight, administration officials said they will freeze $11 billion in Army Corps of Engineers projects and furlough Energy Department employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration.Unions argue administration ignoring part of judge’s orderThe California case was originally brought by the American Federation of Government Employees, the AFL-CIO and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.Danielle Leonard, an attorney representing those unions, said during the hearing the Trump administration had been “overly narrowly interpreting the scope of the TRO and ignoring some of the language in the TRO.”Leonard pointed to a brief filed by the Department of Health and Human Services that said the agency hadn’t issued any layoff notices to workers covered by the TRO, even though an earlier filing to the court said HHS had sent notices to 982 employees.That department, Leonard said, appeared to take the position that an earlier executive order ended all union representation at HHS. “The government is well aware that is a disputed issue,” Leonard said. Elizabeth Hedges, counsel for the Trump administration, said after considerable back and forth that she didn’t agree with Leonard and the judge’s interpretation of the temporary restraining order’s impact. “I would submit that’s not what the TRO says,” Hedges said, though she later told the judge she would make sure the administration complied with the updated explanation of the restraining order.  Hedges also told the judge the Interior Department didn’t previously disclose it was contemplating layoffs because officials began considering those RIFs before the shutdown and were only going to implement them during the shutdown because it’s gone on so long. The judge ordered the Trump administration to tell the court by 9 a.m. Pacific on Monday about any actual or imminent layoff notices under the full scope of the restraining order. Army Corps to pause billions in big-city projects White House budget director Russ Vought announced hours before the emergency court hearing the administration plans to freeze and may unilaterally cancel billions more in funding approved by Congress. “The Democrat shutdown has drained the Army Corps of Engineers' ability to manage billions of dollars in projects,” Vought wrote in a social media post. “The Corps will be immediately pausing over $11 billion in lower-priority projects & considering them for cancellation, including projects in New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Baltimore. More information to come from the Army Corps of Engineers.”The Trump administration has been cited several times by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office for not spending money approved by Congress as lawmakers intended. Generally, after Congress approves a spending bill and it becomes law, the president is supposed to faithfully implement its provisions. Any president that wants to cancel funding lawmakers already approved is supposed to send Congress a rescissions request, which starts a 45-day clock for members to approve, modify, or ignore the request. The Trump administration followed that legal pathway earlier this year when it asked Congress to cancel billions in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and foreign aid. The House and Senate, both controlled by Republicans, approved the request after senators preserved full funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR.The White House budget office sent up another rescissions request in late August, asking lawmakers to cancel billions of additional spending on foreign aid programs. Neither chamber has taken action to approve that request, but Vought believes that since it was sent up within the last 45 days of the fiscal year, he is allowed to cancel that funding without congressional action. The GAO and Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, have both called the maneuver, known as a pocket rescission, unlawful. Nuclear security workers to be furloughedThe Trump administration also announced Friday that it would have more than 1,000 employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration stop working for the remainder of the shutdown, joining hundreds of thousands of others on furlough. According to its website, the NNSA’s job “is to ensure the United States maintains a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear stockpile through the application of unparalleled science, technology, engineering, and manufacturing.”An Energy Department spokesperson wrote in an email to States Newsroom that “approximately 1,400 NNSA federal employees will be furloughed as of Monday, October 20th and nearly 400 NNSA federal employees will continue to work to support the protection of property and the safety of human life. NNSA’s Office of Secure Transportation remains funded through October 27, 2025.”Energy Secretary Chris Wright, the spokesperson said, “will be in Las Vegas, Nevada and at the National Nuclear Security Site Monday to further discuss the impacts of the shutdown on America’s nuclear deterrent.""During past shutdowns federal employees that must keep working as well as those placed on furlough have received back pay. But Trump and administration officials have signaled they may try to reinterpret a 2019 law that authorized back pay for all federal workers once Congress passes a funding bill and the government reopens.",,,,2025-10-17 20:58:03.226601

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Drive across the top of the levee; come back along the levee’s “toe” slope; pause when a flood wall or obstruction crosses the levee; move to the next section. 
This has been the methodology for the Iowa Geological Survey team members the past several fall seasons as they survey the geological integrity of Iowa’s 900 miles of levees. 
The crew is on year three of a five-year, legislatively directed initiative to assess levees across the state to help the state Office of Levee Safety to prioritize funding for repairs on the structures that help prevent flood damage. 
Jason Vogelgesang, a geophysicist with Iowa Geological Survey, said the data collected with the survey helps to point out specific areas of a levee in need of repair, which can help to lower the cost to fix a levee. 
“What we’re trying to do out here is find anomalous areas, or different areas, in the levees that could be a potential area of weakness,” Vogelgesang said. 
He said this way, rather than tearing out an entire levee, a levee system can instead focus repairs to the areas that, based on geological data,  could be more susceptible to failure in a flood event.

How the survey works 
Vogelgesang and his colleague Thomas Doyle, also with the Iowa Geological Survey based at the University of Iowa, head out a couple of times a week during the fall, when the levees are usually mowed and accessible, to drive along the systems. 

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers defines a levee as “an earthen embankment, floodwall, or structure along a water course whose purpose is flood risk reduction or water conveyance.” 

To start the surveying day, the crew rig up a set of PVC pipes on a side-by-side utility vehicle. A ground conductivity meter is then strapped to the PVC, which keeps the vehicle a safe distance from the meter and prevents it from interfering with the meter’s metal readings. 
Vogelgesang said the meter is actually meant to be strapped over a shoulder and carried, but the Iowa Geological Survey team created the rig on the vehicle to more efficiently survey the hundreds of miles of levee systems across the state. 
“It’s kind of an innovative method of collecting these data,” Vogelgesang said.

As he drives along the top of the levee, the meter sends an electrical current that penetrates the subsurface before it comes back up to the meter’s receiver. The current changes as it pass through the ground, which is how the geological team is able to determine the makeup of the subsurface. 
The meter sends five readings per second, which are automatically collected via Bluetooth on a tablet inside the side-by-side. 
The current travels 20 feet down, which Vogelgesang said shows his team “pretty much the whole swath of the levee.” 
After driving along the top of the levee, the crew turns around and drives back along the levee’s “toe slope” or base of the embankment in the floodplain. 
Vogelgesang said driving along the toe slope collects data on the geology below the levee, which can reveal things like a deposit of coarse sand, or a forgotten metal culvert, both of which could allow water to flow through if there were enough hydrological pressure. 
When it comes to levee structures, and geological features below the levee, compact materials like clay are more secure. Sand- and gravel-based levees — which Vogelgesang said he has come across while doing the survey project — could be more likely to fail in the event of a flood.
Vogelgesang’s and Doyle’s Friday trip to Des Moines was the second time they had surveyed levees in the capital city. While they spent their day surveying about 10 miles of levees along the Raccoon River, Vogelgesang said two years ago, they surveyed levees along the eastern side of the Des Moines river. 
Each year, the team aims to survey about 200 miles of levees. Vogelgesang said it takes a significant amount of legwork, before he shows up on site with the side-by-side to map the levees, figure out where obstructions could be and get permission from the cities and levee districts.
After the levees have been driven,  Vogelgesang and his team spend the winter and spring processing and analyzing the thousands of generated data points. Each levee system, which encompasses the levees in the a given region or city, will receive a report from the geological survey about their levees. 
Vogelgesang said these reports are also due to the Iowa Office of Levee Safety.
The office uses the geological findings to rate the levees on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 meaning the levee has a “critical need for repair” and 1 meaning the levee is “optimal,” according to the office.

Iowa Levee Improvement Program
The geological survey of the levees, the Office of Levee Safety and a Levee Improvement Fund, which has an annual appropriation of $5 million from 2024 through 2028, were created in 2023 with the enactment of House File 711. 
These programs comprise the Iowa Levee Improvement Program, which according to the 2024 Iowa Levee Safety report, has a goal of reducing and managing the risks associated with “a hazardous event caused by inadequate levee design, structural performance, or operational control.” 
Under the program, levee districts can apply for cost-share funding to improve their levee systems. The levee ratings, issued by the Office of Levee Safety and informed by Vogelgesang’s surveys, are considered when the Iowa Flood Mitigation Board issues the funds.
Levee improvement program was established after a 2022 study found that “the current approach of managing and financing levee districts within the state of Iowa is unsustainable.”
The Iowa Levee Improvement Program is a step toward improving the state of Iowa’s levee structures, which help to control flooding events. 
So far, the Iowa Geological Survey has driven and collected data on more than 300 miles of Iowa levees and will be over halfway done surveying at the end of the season. 
The Office of Levee Safety has held several town halls, established the levee rating system and generated partnerships across levee districts to develop a “unified approach to flood risk management” according to the annual report. 
“We are committed to continuous improvement, leveraging data-driven insights to enhance our initiatives and reinforce our response to flood events,” the annual report read.

Virginia is among the states that have parted ways with new federal guidance restricting access to the vaccine. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Health insurers in Pennsylvania will be required to cover COVID-19 and other vaccinations through 2026. 
All accident and health insurance policy issuers in the commonwealth will have to cover vaccinations “without cost-sharing and the imposition of other administrative barriers”, under a notice issued Friday by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department.  
That means Pennsylvanians can receive the COVID-19 vaccinations without copays, deductibles, or other costs, when administered by an in-network provider and without insurers requiring extra steps that make it harder for people to get vaccinated. It also allows pharmacists to follow guidance from a number of trusted medical organizations when giving vaccines.
It also encourages insurers that handle employer-funded health plans, which are not directly regulated by the commonwealth, to ensure that access to vaccines remains consistent for their insured.
The directive comes in response to changes at the Centers for Disease Control that could make obtaining the vaccine more difficult across the country. 
“This is about keeping promises to Pennsylvanians. Vaccines are one of the best ways to prevent serious illness, and we want every Pennsylvanian to have affordable, easy access to protect themselves and their families,” Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys said in a statement. “If your health insurance plan says it covers vaccines, that coverage will remain in place at least through 2026. It should be easy for you to get vaccinated.”
The agency has received numerous questions about vaccine coverage following the CDC’s actions this year, according to the notice published in Saturday’s issue of the Pennsylvania Bulletin. 
The CDC recently dropped its universal COVID-19 vaccine recommendation, as well as other changes to its immunization schedule that include toddlers receiving the measles, mumps and rubella shot separately from the chickenpox vaccine. 
“Informed consent is back,” declared Acting CDC Director and Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services Jim O’Neill upon approving the changes Oct. 6.
The CDC’s 2022 blanket recommendation for the COVID-19 immunization “deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent”, O’Neill said.
The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) had recommended changes to the immunization schedule in September – a few months after all 17 members of the committee were removed and replaced by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime and outspoken vaccine skeptic. 
Kennedy gutted the committee – a panel of experts who issue guidance for the nation’s doctors and pharmacists – shortly after he declared the CDC would no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. He didn’t cite any specific studies and potentially put the authority’s guidelines at odds with professional associations representing thousands of pediatricians, gynecologists, family doctors and scientists across the country.
Historically, Pennsylvania’s Board of Pharmacy has followed the recommendations of ACIP. But on Sept. 3, the board unanimously approved a measure allowing the agency to issue vaccine guidance based on the recommendations of three medical professional societies: the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, as well as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The commonwealth also joined a coalition of northeastern states to coordinate on public health efforts such as emergency preparedness and the creation of immunization guidelines. 
Other states in the Northeast Public Health Collaborative (NEPHC) include Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. All have Democratic governors, except Vermont which is run by Republican Phil Scott.
Gov. Josh Shapiro signed an executive order Oct. 1 that directs state agencies to safeguard vaccine access through the creation of a vaccine safety net for children and by aligning policies with medical experts.
The order also launched a central vaccine portal and a vaccine education workgroup to improve public communication and fight misinformation.
“Importantly, the executive order reinforces that recommended vaccines should remain covered under both private insurance and Medicaid in Pennsylvania. This step ensures that whether someone has a state or private plan, their access to immunizations is protected and consistent,” the Insurance Department said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1351333811.jpg,,,2025-10-17 20:03:47.572209

This photo is by no means exhaustive. Seventy-two Montanans were charged, tried and convicted for running afoul of the Montana Sedition Act. A new presidential memo on national security is a direct attack on civil liberties — and a reminder of a disturbing period of Montana history, said the head of the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana and a retired University of Montana professor.
“Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence,” also known as NSPM-7 (National Security Presidential Memorandum), states that recent incidents of political violence, including the fatal shooting of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, are not isolated and merit a “new law enforcement strategy.”
It said a National Joint Terrorism Task Force, with support from local law enforcement, will root out groups rallying around “Anti-Americanism” and “Anti-Christianity” in chat rooms, in-person meetings, social media, and educational institutions.
But the directive against “anti-fascism” and “terrorism” is also a reminder of the lessons that came after the Montana sedition law of 1918, said UM professor Clem Work and the ACLU’s Akilah Deernose in recent interviews.
“Sticking to the legal aspects, it is just an assault on the First Amendment for sure — and on dissent,” said Work, who led the Montana Sedition Project of the UM School of Journalism.
In a special session in 1918, Montana lawmakers passed a law that “criminalized just about anything negative said or written about the government or its conduct of the war,” according to the Montana Sedition Project.
Smithsonian Magazine described the law in Montana as “one of the harshest sedition laws in U.S. history.”
Deernose said the memo is part of a larger pattern of the Trump administration silencing and intimidating its critics or anyone who speaks for ideologies for which the president does not agree.
“Truly, there is nothing more un-American than abrogating freedom of speech or freedom of expression,” Deernose said.
Signed by President Donald Trump on Sept. 25, the memo outlines strategies for a task force to investigate Americans who participate in “organized structures, networks, entities, (and) organizations” and “all participants in these criminal and terroristic conspiracies” that it believes pose a security threat.
There are about 200 such task forces in the U.S., including at least one in each Federal Bureau of Investigation’s 56 field offices and the rest in local, state and other federal agencies, according to States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C., Bureau, citing the FBI.
“Common threads animating this violent conduct include anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality,” the memo said.
Deernose said part of what’s stunning is “the breadth of what is prohibited.”
However, she also said the labels used in the memo are vague and undefined, and it’s important to remember that just because the president offers a narrative, it doesn’t mean people have to adopt it.
“There’s no doubt right now that we have an administration who seems determined to undermine and constrain civil rights and civil liberties,” Deernose said. “And we’ve also seen a lot of puffery. The president is experimenting to see what he can and cannot get away with.”
She recommended people filter the narrative through what they know to be true. For example, Deernose said Americans have the Constitutional right to free speech and freedom of expression, and those rights are strong.
She also said the judiciary is a check on presidential power, and people shouldn’t take for granted that the president has all the authority he tries to claim.
“Don’t accept that you are powerless because you are not powerless,” Deernose said.
Work, who said his “hairs stood on end” reading the memo, said the ideas it presents are based on fear, as are a lot of laws and political actions.
“We need to be aware that this is an attempt to instill fear based on a fear that the enemy is within, and recognize that it is a lot more sophisticated attack on free speech than Montana’s sedition law was,” Work said.
But work also said the terms in the memo are vague and undefined.
“What is anti-capitalism? What is anti-Christianity? What is hostility toward those who hold traditional American views?” Work said. “ … If you air it to the logical conclusion, that would amount to the prosecution of a whole helluva lot of people in this country.”
Work said free speech rights were protected under the First Amendment, but the anti-sedition law would not have been held unconstitutional at the time it was passed.
He said the U.S. Supreme Court didn’t start taking a more robust view of the First Amendment until 1925, when it found in Gitlow v. New York that the protection covers abuses by state governments, not just the federal government.
Protections for dissent strengthened in the 1930s through the 1960s, “kind of the golden age of protection of political dissent,” Work said.
He said people still have those rights in this country, and while Republican-appointed members of the U.S. Supreme Court are generally sensitive to First Amendment rights, they’re also likely to give greater weight to security concerns.
“But this memorandum is a much more sophisticated assault on political dissent,” Work said. “It’s kind of comparing a broadax to an AR-15.”
For example, he said it is using the memo to go after the tax-exempt status of organizations, which has raised concerns among law firms with large nonprofit clients.
Work’s book, “Darkest Before Dawn: Sedition and Free Speech in the American West,” spurred the project to clear the names of people who were convicted of sedition in Montana in World War I.
Most of the 79 people convicted of sedition were blue collar workers, according to the Montana Sedition Project.
After attending a reading of “Darkest Before Dawn,” a UM law school professor launched a clinic with students to research the idea of posthumous pardons.
In May 2006, Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer signed a proclamation of clemency for 78 Montanans convicted under the Montana Sedition Act. It said the law of 1918 ushered in “one of the darkest periods in Montana’s political history,” punishing “even the mildest forms of political dissent.”
(The Missoulian said one man had his sentence commuted in 1921.)
The Smithsonsian said one “scofflaw” was Peter Ervik, who “got two-to-four years for allegedly saying, “I would sooner fight for the Kaiser than I would for the United States, f*ck the United States and f*ck the flag. I mean it.”
One refused to kiss the flag, and another criticized butter and sugar rations, according to examples from the Smithsonian.
The proclamation from Schweitzer said he had the power to grant the pardons, even nearly one century after those who were convicted faced punishment for the enforcement of “a unanimity of thought” around the war.
“There is no time limitation for correcting injustice and clearing the names of honorable people,” the proclamation said. “By this Proclamation, I have extended and do extend a full and unconditional pardon from the offense of Sedition alleged to have been committed during 1918-1919 and from the conviction of Sedition and from all sentences, judgments, and executions thereon.”
Work said the memory of the actions, especially when the gubernatorial pardons brought them to light, seemed to resonate strongly with people, but he also said history has the potential to repeat itself if people don’t exercise their rights.
“The fates of those political prisoners who were put in prison for years tells us that hysteria can take over so easily, and people can be punished for no just reason, just because it’s politically expedient at the moment,” Work said.
The ACLU was founded partly in response to the first wave of anti-sedition laws, Deernose said, and she encouraged people to learn from Montana’s sedition history to prevent repeating the mistakes of the past.
“It’s unimaginable that in Montana, people were jailed — actually jailed — for saying benign statements such as, ‘The ration system is dumb,’” Deernose said.
She said she believes there’s still time to avoid a backslide in democracy, and one way people can steer a different way is to band together.
“Hopefully, one silver lining of this scary time is that we build more connection, we build more bridges, and we unite on all the things that really connect us, because there are a lot more things that connect us than divide us,” Deernose said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Montanans-Sedition-History.jpeg,,,2025-10-17 20:03:47.572209

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Attorney General’s office released a proposed explanation Friday for a potential citizen-initiated ballot question that would repeal property taxes and replace them with a retail transaction tax.
The sponsor of the measure is Abolish Property Taxes SD, a statewide ballot question committee formed by former legislator Julie Frye-Mueller, Matt Smith and Mike Mueller. They’re seeking to place a state constitutional amendment on the ballot in the November 2026 general election.
From property to purchases: Task force considering fundamental tax shift to reduce homeowner burden

Attorney General Marty Jackley is required to provide a fair and neutral explanation of the measure.
His Friday news release said the measure would repeal South Dakota’s property tax system set forth in the state constitution and replace it with a tax on each retail transaction. For each retail transaction of $15 or more, a flat tax of $1.50 would be assessed. For each retail transaction less than $15, a 10% tax would be assessed.
The transaction taxes would be added on top of current sales taxes, which include the state 4.2% sales tax, up to 2% city sales taxes, and up to 1% additional city taxes on alcohol, restaurants, event admissions and lodging.
The public has 10 days, until Oct. 27, to provide written comment on the explanation. The final explanation is due to the Secretary of State’s Office on Nov. 5.
The sponsors will have to circulate petitions and gather at least 35,017 signatures from registered South Dakota voters to qualify the measure for the ballot.

(Courtesy of Gov. Jared Polis on X)Colorado officials told the U.S. Supreme Court this week that any assertions it is violating the water rights of eastern neighbor Nebraska under a century-old compact are “unripe and premature.”
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and his office wrote in a 42-page filing that Nebraska, like every western state, wants more water. However, Colorado officials said the interstate South Platte River Compact, enacted in 1923, doesn’t give Nebraska the water rights the Cornhusker State claimed when it submitted a complaint in mid-July.
The legal response largely denies Nebraska’s claims as “speculative” and that while there might be a controversy for the high court to resolve one day, it isn’t now.
“The Supreme Court need not take a case that would put the court and the parties on a long, time-intensive and expensive path that might well, in the end, put the states right back where they were before Nebraska filed their proposed complaint,” Weiser said in a statement.
Nebraska sues Colorado over South Platte River water rights, Perkins County Canal

“Even if the court decides to take up part or all of Nebraska’s case, I’m confident that we will win on the merits,” Weister continued. “Both the facts and the law are on our side.”
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and Attorney General Mike Hilgers said they remain undeterred by Colorado’s arguments. Hilgers said his office is reviewing Colorado’s brief and will respond.
The U.S. Supreme Court will still need to decide whether to take up the case. If it proceeds, it could take years before justices hear oral arguments or issue an opinion.
“Nebraska looks forward to enforcing its water rights under this critical compact in front of the U.S. Supreme Court,” Hilgers said.
Nebraska rights questioned
Among the biggest points of contention is what rights Nebraska has during and outside of the irrigation season listed in the South Platte River Compact. Former Gov. Pete Ricketts, now a Republican U.S. senator, revived the century-old multi-state agreement in 2022, a year the country faced widespread, long-term drought conditions. Pillen has continued to carry the torch for it, and Hilgers was speaker of the Nebraska Legislature in 2022.

Under the compact, Nebraska has the right to 120 cubic feet of water per second during the irrigation season (April 1 to Oct. 15). Nebraska would have a right to 500 cubic feet of water per second at other times of the year, but only if it builds a canal in Colorado to let it capture and transport such water for irrigation.
The South Platte River originates in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, continuing to Nebraska.
Nebraska state lawmakers have appropriated more than $600 million in taxpayer dollars to build the “Perkins County Canal.” Those Nebraska tax dollars are meant to build a canal that could divert up to 1,000 cubic feet of water per second in above-average water years, higher than the 500 cfs the state is “entitled” to under the compact. Some Democratic state lawmakers have repeatedly sought to scale back the project’s costs.
Nebraska officials assert that the state has the right to a “minimum” of 120 cfs of water during the irrigation season. The compact explicitly gives Nebraska a “priority” of 120 cfs of water in the “Lower Section” of the South Platte River during irrigation season. It prohibits Colorado from diverting any Lower Section water, unless those water users predate July 14, 1897.

Colorado says the compact guarantees a “place in line” for 120 cfs if there are no older, or “senior,” water users that need the flows downstream from the “Upper Section” of the river.
“If it is not available from shutting off, or ‘curtailing,’ junior water users, Colorado is under no obligation to find water elsewhere,” the Colorado filing states.
Colorado officials wrote that Nebraska alleges “few, if any facts,” that Colorado is harming Nebraska in the irrigation season but that if there are issues, the states might be able to resolve them together first. 
The states had been meeting at least sporadically the past couple of years to address water concerns. Colorado criticized Nebraska for filing the lawsuit three weeks before a meeting between the states scheduled for August.
Colorado noted Nebraska is still in the very early stages of canal construction— on Aug. 13, selecting a contractor for an extensive environmental review for permitting, and on Oct. 1, holding the first informational session with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

‘Day in court’
The interstate compact stands out in part because it gives Nebraska the power to condemn and seize land in a neighboring state if needed. Colorado estimated Nebraska’s project would need to secure land rights from about 30 owners. Nebraska has not yet pursued legal action but was in contact with six landowners earlier this year when negotiations fell through.

Colorado officials said that if Nebraska “overreaches” the state will fight to protect its people and water.
“Holding Nebraska to the contours of the rights prescribed by the compact is not ‘interference,’” the Colorado filing states.
Pillen this week again blamed Colorado. He said that as the Denver metropolis has grown, the Centennial State has “shirked” its water obligations and hurt Nebraska ag producers. 
“I have faith in AG Hilger’s leadership in this case, and Nebraska looks forward to having its day in court,” Pillen said.
In July, Pillen said he had not discussed the lawsuit or canal with Colorado Gov. Jared Polis. Pillen said the two “do not agree one iota, and there’s no sense in further conversations.”
‘A meritless lawsuit’
Colorado officials counter that Nebraska has no remedy under the compact to the Upper Section of the South Platte River, including any development. The response brief says Nebraska is essentially asking for an “advisory opinion” on the “pros and cons” of building a canal that could possibly be used to renegotiate the compact.
While the two states appear to be at an impasse and are led by opposing political parties — Democrats to the west, Republicans to the east — Polis invoked a phrase that Pillen has often used: “Water is the lifeblood of our state.” 
Polis said his state has always “faithfully honored” its century-old compact with Nebraska and all other water agreements with its downstream states. He said Colorado would continue to do so.
Said Polis: “We refuse to sit idly by while Nebraska chases a meritless lawsuit that threatens Colorado’s precious water resources, our robust agriculture industry and our rural communities in Northeastern Colorado.”

The day after Vermont requested federal aid for farmers, the government shut down. At an Orwell farm, farmers gathered to share how the drought is affecting them.

Peter Welch meets drought impacted farmers as Vermont awaits statewide federal disaster designation.","Farmer Jesse Wilbur, left, examines a handful of dessicated soil with U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vermont, as Welch tours the Lazy Dog Farm in Orwell to learn about the impact drought has had on local farmers on Friday, October 17, 2025. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
ORWELL — Jesse Wilbur, owner of Lazy Dog Farm, stood among his cows out in the dry pasture with U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., on Friday morning. Wilbur pointed to brown cracks in the soil, where he said he stuck his hand a foot deep a day before. 
Wilbur, in his dusted farm pants, picked up a clump of stiff grass, yellow around the edges, and put it in Welch’s hand. 
“Now, is that a piece of lettuce that you’d want to eat?” Wilbur asked. 
Welch had gathered with a handful of neighboring farmers at Wilbur’s farm in Addison County to reflect on how Vermont’s historic drought is stressing the state’s farmers.
Drought conditions have stunted Wilbur’s feed production on his dairy farm and stressed him financially. And Wilbur is just one of many farmers feeling the drought’s effects.
On the last day of September, Vermont officials wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and asked them to issue a statewide disaster designation, which would open up federal aid to assist Vermont’s farmers. But the federal government shut down the next day — halting work at the federal department.

Now Vermont’s letter is awaiting reply.  
The disaster designation could provide Vermont farmers with “a bevy of programs,” said Anson Tebbetts, secretary of Vermont’s Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets. Those programs include low-interest loans and emergency funding to cover losses in livestock or crops.
On Friday morning, the state agency launched a survey to get input from farmers about damages they’re facing as a result of persistent drought. It’s open until Dec. 15. Documenting the effects of drought goes a long way when pushing for policy change or asking for aid from Washington, Welch said.
Welch and Tebbetts urged farmers gathered outside of Wilbur’s big red barn to fill out the survey. In turn, the farmers shared stories about how they’re hurting.
Jon Lucas, who owns the Lucas Dairy Farm in Orwell, was the first one to speak. He said that rain in April and May pushed back planting of his crops. But then it stopped raining altogether, which made it hard for the crops to grow and delayed cutting them.
The wells that supported Lucas’s cattle went dry, he said. Then the pond did too. Now he borrows a truck to haul water from a creek down the road. 
“We just put in a well last week. It’s not up and running yet, but we had to spend money in getting more water,” he said. He had a new well drilled because he doesn’t want to haul water during the winter and isn’t sure how much longer the drought will continue.

Kylie and Jeremy Chittenden, who run nearby Richville Farms, said the quality of their feed was bad as a result of the drought, and they had to compensate by buying grain to feed their cows. 
“Maybe one of the greatest things about farmers is we’re eternally hopeful for a better day,” Kylie Chittenden said. “And so we’re like, well, we’re just going to keep going because it’s going to rain soon, but soon just didn’t come.”
The farm had to source 4,000 tons of corn from out of state and will probably have to source 2,000 more, she said. And while their crop insurance alleviates some costs, it is still going to be a significant expense, according to Kylie Chittenden.
Some farmers said they bought feed from Canada, but many said they have to truck in feed from further states because the whole Northeast has been impacted by the drought. 
The Vermont Agency of Agriculture also maintains a Feed-Finder Marketplace page to connect farmers and help them find feed to buy.
Jesse Wilbur, the owner of Lazy Dog Farm, said that even if the state received the disaster designation for the drought, it would probably still take time to receive funds, as farmers are only now receiving funds for the losses they suffered from heavy rainfall and flooding in 2023 and 2024. 
Welch said that he wants government aid to help farmers get through the drought. He said it was “terrible” that farmers have to grapple with drought conditions when they’re still reeling from the financial losses caused by flooding. 
“We had some other assets we were able to sell and move around to cover our expenses,” Wilbur said, explaining that he used that money to buy feed. 
“We’re able to survive through it, which is good,” he said, but added that many of his fellow farmers are “a bit more financially unstable.”
Jessica Hays Lucas, an organizer for The Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont, said that her group is pushing the state to fund an emergency relief fund for farmers.

Last legislative session, the organization lobbied for the Farm Security Fund, which would reimburse farmers for up to 50% of uninsured or uncovered losses. The organization is asking the state to buy into that fund, Hays Lucas said. In the spring, a bill to create the fund cleared the Vermont  Senate before being left behind in a House committee. 
Aid from a state fund “can be more nimble” than federal assistance and would have gone a long way this fall, Hays Lucas said. 
“I’m fearful that there isn’t that many of us in agriculture anymore,” Kylie Chittenden said. “Our numbers start to shrink really quick when we don’t have the resources to take care of our business, like our cows and feed.”

This story by Liberty Darr was first published by Charlotte News on Oct. 16.
Carrie Spear had a vision more than two decades ago: a train of tractors parading through town. Since then, that vision has taken on a life of its own.
Spear had just bought the Spears Corner Store in 2001 when Joe Bean, a well-known farmer in town, parked his “beautiful, rusty” tractor in the parking lot. At that time, Spear was looking to add some fun into the town and into her own life, knowing that much of it would soon be consumed with managing her new business venture.
So, Bean’s serendipitous trip to the store couldn’t have been better timed. She looked at him and said, “Want to have a tractor parade?”
To which Bean responded, “Well, not with that tractor.”
“It’s the gosh-honest truth,” Spear said last week. “I’m standing there a month into store keeping, not having a clue what the future would hold, and he drives up, this big old farmer, rough voice. It was just a beautiful scenario.”
The first East Charlotte Tractor Parade was held in 2001, and although it took some years off during the Covid-19 pandemic and the flooding that struck the state in 2023, it never truly left anybody’s heart.
In fact, attendance at the parade grew so much that in 2019, someone whispered in Spear’s ear, “How are you going to reign this genie back into the bottle?” she recalled, letting out a laugh.
Spear has stepped back from helming the annual tradition and passed the torch off to a younger generation that has set out to keep the tradition going, hopefully, for another 20 years.
Terra Heilenbach moved to Charlotte from California 13 years ago. She remembers the tractor parade being one of the first things that greeted her upon her arrival in town.
“I came to the parade at a friend’s house next door to us, and just loved it,” she said. “I thought it was truly heartwarming. It just touches on something timeless that I think is really neat. And those kinds of things really appeal to me.”
She helped Spear with the planning and organizing last year, but when it came down to beginning prep for this year, Spear knew her time overseeing the event was over.
“A part of me was like, ‘Am I even the person to take this on?’ Because, you know, I’m not from Vermont. I was just kind of like, am I forcing this on this town?” Heilenbach said. “And so, I just started asking people and I saw how much of a part of Charlotte the parade is.”
From there, it was off to the races for Heilenbach. And this past weekend, with the help of some dedicated volunteers and friends, she successfully ran her first-ever tractor parade, complete with 60 tractors, more than a couple hundred spectators, a band and vendors.
While not everyone in the parade is considered a farmer, many of them are. But still, the celebration brings dozens of people, who have polished and rebuilt their rides for this very moment, including an older couple from New York who made the trek across the lake on the ferry, hauling with them four tractors.

Spear, who was enjoying the day alongside her community, is at an interesting juncture. Watching the parade drive by this year, she saw all of its earliest years, while simultaneously seeing all the years that are still to come.
Charlotte is an agricultural town, with the stories of generations of farmers ingrained in its history. A story about Charlotte would be incomplete without a story about the farmers who have tended the land for generations.
Without all the frills and fun, it is the stories of the generations of farmers that is  the heart of the annual East Charlotte Tractor Parade. Aside from an event that makes even the grouchiest Charlotters crack a smile, the event is a giant tribute to who and what Charlotte is.
“I never set out to do this,” Spear said. “This is the people’s parade. And it just kept evolving so beautifully with the volunteers that I had over the years. I would have never been able to do it without them.”

An estimated 6,000 federal employees in Wyoming are not working or receiving paychecks after 17 days of the government shutdown. Some are angry.
The post Furloughed federal workers struggle, hang on, help one another appeared first on WyoFile .","Civilian federal workers in Wyoming furloughed during the government shutdown say they’re stressed, angry and trying to help one another as their paychecks are cut, leaving them languishing in uncertainty.
As the shutdown entered its 17th day, two furloughed workers said they and their colleagues are asking one another whether refrigerators are stocked, whether counseling is needed and even whether their co-workers are low on cash. After one virtual group meeting, a worker for a federal land agency said she and others were told by supervisors to apply for unemployment benefits and offered mental health counseling.
“I think I could do six months,” Betty (not her real name) said of her financial situation. “I’m in a really lucky position.
“I have worked really hard to get to this point,” she said, asking for a pseudonym for fear of retribution by her agency. “All of my savings this year have been purely out of the fear something would happen to my job.”
The savings were intended for a down payment for a home or perhaps a vacation. But they’ve become insurance for shutdowns, something she dreads every October when budget showdowns occur.
For Veronica, (another pseudonym), her survival window is shorter. “I could go probably two months if I’m really strapping down,” she said.
“It’s been an abusive relationship since this administration came in, [saying] we are worthless.” Federal employee “Veronica”
“A lot of us are, we are like ‘f*** it!’” she said. “It’s been an abusive relationship since this administration came in, [saying] we are worthless.”
Across Wyoming, 2.4% of the state’s civilian workforce is employed by the federal government, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Wyoming had 282,703 people in the civilian work pool, according to the Wyoming Department of Workforce Services.
That would put the estimated number of furloughed civilian federal workers in the state at close to 7,000.
Intense lifestyle choices
Betty said the shutdown’s two-week mark is the turning point at which employees will start missing a complete paycheck. Her last check was about $500 short because of the shutdown, “an amount I could adjust to.”
Now, however, she’s forced to make “intense lifestyle choices.”
“I’ve got a trip — travel plans coming up,” she said. “I’ll have to be pretty frugal. I’m not eating out with friends, changing the types of activities we do, [pursuing] my less-expensive hobbies.”
“I have a lot of friends who say, ‘Why don’t you just take a road trip,’” she said. But that costs money, and she’s still basically on-call to return to work.
“It feels like a really long weekend, but every day is Sunday and I might have to go back tomorrow,” she said. “It’s harder than I thought it would be.”
Veronica worries for families. “It’s super scary for people with kids,” she said.

How is the 2025 government shutdown impacting you? WyoFile wants to hear from you.

They tell her they can’t pull their children from daycare for fear of losing a coveted slot. “There’s still a lot of money going out and none coming in.”
Colleagues who are supporting one another are asking, “Hey, what’s your fridge look like?” Veronica said. “We have full freezers but our bank accounts are low.
“Everybody’s strapped for cash right now, just to pay their bills,” she said. But none are expecting or asking for cash.
Some federal employees who are “essential workers” have to show up to work, which can entail spending money on gas. But they also don’t get a paycheck, she said.
There are several federal assistance programs available, including for counselling, the two women said. In Teton County, the community resource nonprofit One22 is offering $250 stipend gift cards to federal workers in need.
Recipients can spend the money at Smith’s on food, at the pharmacy or for gas. The application process requires proof of employment and other documentation.
“Things are going smoothly,” said Seadar Rose Davis, director of community engagement. The group had processed 113 applications by early afternoon Friday.
“I’ve talked to quite a few people,” she said. “They’ve been incredibly appreciative.
“They feel seen and feel valued,” she said. “I’m glad we can provide a small piece for them.”
The program will continue for 10 days after the shutdown ends, according to the One22 website.
‘Reduction in force’
Some employees are worried they might lose their jobs during the shutdown through a “reduction in force” initiative by President Donald Trump’s administration. “A furlough of more than 30 calendar days, or of more than 22 discontinuous work days, is also a RIF action,” the Office of Personnel Management states on its website.
A colleague of Veronica worried about a federal notice she and others received that indicated that after 30 days, “we can just get rid of you,” she said. There’s a fear that people might be fired even before then.
A federal judge, however, sided with employees Wednesday, issuing a temporary restraining order “enjoining shutdown-related RIFs.” She was ruling on a motion brought by the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees and others in a suit filed against the Office of Management and Budget and others.

U.S. District Judge Susan Illston also set an Oct. 28 hearing for an injunction. “If what plaintiffs allege is true, then the agencies’ actions in laying off thousands of public employees during a government shutdown — and in targeting for RIFs those programs that are perceived as favored by a particular political party — is the epitome of hasty, arbitrary and capricious decisionmaking,” her order reads.
The employees’ federation and other plaintiffs “are likely to prevail on the merits of their claims under the [Administrative Procedures Act],” the order reads.
Meantime, federal work is at a standstill, and some employees are quitting. Betty estimated that of her team of about 250 employees, 20-30 might be working.
“There’s one person in [Washington] D.C. doing the work of 250,” she said. “I did hear today we are losing people on a daily basis from our agency,” she said Wednesday. For them, “this is the last straw.”
“There were people who literally just quit,” Veronica added. “I know of at least three instances where that happened.”
About three or four people in her roughly 100-person agency in Wyoming are at work, she said. The ranks are down from 120 before DOGE firings and severance offers, she said.
Republicans blamed
Veronica doesn’t mince words when it comes to the question of who’s responsible for her situation. 
“I blame this on the Republicans,” Veronica said, “and the fact that we are now sliding into an authoritarian government. I can see the writing on the wall.”
“If the shutdown ended tomorrow, we better have those health care subsidies,” she said, supporting Democrats’ argument that such aid must be part of any shutdown resolution. “I don’t want to pay an extra $150 [a month].”
Betty is trying to hang on.
“I have not thought of quitting,” she said. “I feel really tied to the mission of my agency.
“I didn’t leave from [severance] offers and scare tactics,” she said. “The shutdown is the most normal of the weird stuff that has happened this year.”
“I tend to blame the Republicans more,” Betty said. “I come from that with a bias. I support what the Democrats are doing — standing up for health care. That’s incredibly important to me.”
Most important to her is mutual support.
“If you weren’t able to prepare for this, there’s no shame in it,” she said of her colleagues in need. “Community’s the most important thing we have always, but especially now.”

Larry Rhoden/Twitter)The leader of the company that abandoned its immediate plans to build a $2.6 billion ethanol-based jet fuel plant in Lake Preston said Friday that South Dakota is no longer a friendly place to do business.
In 2022, Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber stood alongside South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden, then the lieutenant governor, at the ceremonial groundbreaking for the project, billed as the largest economic development project in state history.
This week, Gruber and his Colorado-based company announced plans for a smaller jet fuel facility at an ethanol plant in Richardton, North Dakota.
Gevo bought the plant a year ago in the wake of South Dakota pushback on a carbon sequestration pipeline that was critical to the company’s Lake Preston business plan. 
“South Dakota is a very difficult place to do business,” Gruber told South Dakota Searchlight on Friday. “Everything is oppositional. North Dakota is a breath of fresh air.”
Gruber said his company still hopes to build something on the 200-odd acres it owns in Kingsbury County at some point in the future. It wouldn’t be a standalone ethanol plant, he said, but it could be a jet fuel plant that uses corn oil or ethanol, or be used as a chemical production plant.










South Dakota is a very difficult place to do business. Everything is oppositional. North Dakota is a breath of fresh air.


– Patrick Gruber, CEO of Gevo


Gruber sees a future where 70 of the nation’s approximately 180 ethanol plants use designs like Gevo’s to convert to jet fuel production. Demand is growing, he said, and the U.S. can’t keep up with the petroleum-based refineries it has.
That’s long-term, though. Whether the Lake Preston site is a part of that conversation or is used for another offshoot of Gevo’s operations is also a ways off. 
At this point, after watching opposition to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline drive policy changes over the past three years, Gruber said he’s wary of engaging South Dakota leaders.
In 2022, he said, there was strong support in state leadership for both the pipeline and Gevo’s Net Zero-1 complex in Kingsbury County.
Then the political winds shifted.
“Having lived through the change, I’m not doing that again,” Gruber said.
Carbon sequestration drives business
Summit Carbon Solutions had hoped to gather carbon dioxide from ethanol plants across multiple states and deliver it via underground pipe to a site in North Dakota for sequestration. In doing so, the company would cash in on federal carbon capture tax credits.
Gevo, were it to build its operations in Lake Preston and connect to that line, would be able to lower the carbon emissions of its jet fuel, boosting its value in certain markets.

Gevo’s North Dakota plant sits atop the same formation that would be used to sequester carbon by Summit. This year, Gevo’s been pumping the carbon from that plant underground and selling carbon credits to other companies that want to offset their carbon footprint. Sequestering carbon also lowers an ethanol plant’s carbon score, so Gevo can sell it for more in some areas.
Gruber said the company can also sell carbon to fossil fuel companies in North Dakota’s oilfields for use in enhanced oil recovery — pumping gas underground to force more crude oil toward a well.
“We did good by buying that plant,” Gruber told Searchlight.
Summit, meanwhile, is in limbo. Gov. Rhoden signed a bill banning the use of eminent domain by carbon pipeline companies this year. Eminent domain is the legal process by which land access can be obtained for use in projects that benefit the public, with compensation for landowners determined by a court. The specter of eminent domain sparked landowner opposition, litigation and political activism in South Dakota, leading to the ban.
The Public Utilities Commission denied Summit’s permit application twice, but the company vowed to reapply.
Issue splits governor candidates
On Thursday, Rhoden said he’s glad to hear that Gevo may still build in South Dakota. He also said signing the eminent domain ban for carbon pipelines was the right thing to do in response to citizen concerns, and that Summit has a chance to “reset” its plans and work with landowners.
Rhoden has not announced if he’ll be a candidate to keep his job in 2026, but he’s spent much of his first year in office on an “Open for Opportunity” tour to meet business leaders across the state.
South Dakota Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, was the first Republican to announce his intention to run for governor. He’s been among the loudest opponents of the carbon pipeline.

Hansen said he’s not saddened to hear about Gevo’s shift to North Dakota. He pointed to a $12.2 million tax rebate authorized for Gevo by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development in 2023 and said companies ought to be able to thrive in South Dakota without incentives.
“This is yet another example of what I’ve been fighting against: politicians and bureaucrats in the Governor’s Office of Economic Development getting duped by green-energy and other scams — abusing so-called ‘economic development’ programs to hand out our tax dollars to out-of-state corporations.”
Hansen said South Dakotans “want our money back,” and that “corporate welfare waste” would end if he were elected governor. 
Gruber said Friday, however, that Gevo never used its tax rebate, because it was predicated on building the Net Zero-1. Since that hasn’t happened, “we have not taken any money from South Dakota.” Josie Harms, Rhoden’s spokeswoman, confirmed that Gevo hasn’t collected any state money, and that it has paid sales taxes on anything it purchased in South Dakota to prepare the site.
Nothing has been done to the land for about two years. 
Governor race exposes divergent paths on economic development among South Dakota Republicans

Another Republican candidate for governor, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden, also leaned in on opposition to publicly funded economic development incentives in his statement on Gevo. He said companies that want to locate in South Dakota should “share our values” and be able to “succeed without politicians putting their fingers on the scale.”
“As governor, I will attract businesses, large and small, who will come here on fair terms,” Doeden said in a statement. “Businesses that move here should do so on their own two feet without demanding hundreds of millions in state subsidies or abusing residents in the process.”
Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, who’s also declared his candidacy for governor in 2026, has talked recently about wanting to make South Dakota’s business climate more friendly again. This week, he sent out a press release on a “Data Centers Done Right” initiative, which he said would incentivize their placement in South Dakota and make the state “be a national leader in the AI revolution.”
Hansen and Doeden each responded to that announcement by saying they’re opposed to tax breaks. 
Johnson, in a statement on the Gevo situation, said anti-development attitudes are the reason the state lost ground in the latest iteration of CNBC’s “America’s Top States for Business” rankings.
“Unfortunately, this isn’t the only project looking to leave South Dakota,” Johnson wrote. “Our state has slid down the rankings to the 35th best state for business. South Dakota has many strengths, but if we are going to meet our potential, we’ll need vision and a plan.”
Robert Arnold, the only declared Democratic candidate for governor, said South Dakotans have made their feelings on the carbon pipeline clear. But he also said he’d like to see Gevo follow through and build in South Dakota.
“I hope that we haven’t turned this industry completely away from us and we can negotiate a deal down the road,” Arnold said in a statement.
Lake Preston anticipated loss
Lake Preston Mayor Donna Bumann said pipeline opposition wasn’t an issue in her community. 
“For the farmers in our area that Summit has connected with, it’s been quite positive,” Bumann said. “I realize that’s not the same in other areas.”
Gevo trumpets cash on hand, growth potential for sustainable jet fuel in earnings call

Bumann said her community had embraced Gevo and the benefits its proposed jet fuel plant promised. In a presentation offered to investors last year, the company included a slide that said Net Zero-1 would return $170 million annually to the South Dakota economy, create 1,300 short-term and 100 long-term jobs, partner with universities to promote science education and draw graduates to its operations, and pay area farmers a premium for corn.
“We are hopeful that, in due time, circumstances will make it possible for Gevo to move forward,” Bumann said.
Kingsbury County Commission Chairman Kyle Lee wasn’t surprised by the news, either.
“Once the state said that they weren’t going to allow for Summit to do any eminent domain, I think we knew that was going to end up being the straw that broke the camel’s back,” Lee said.
Net Zero-1’s footprint would’ve included an ethanol plant, a plant to turn that ethanol into jet fuel, and a wind farm proposed by a company called Zero6. It also spurred East River Electric Cooperative to invest in a switching station near the Gevo site, meant to help service the company’s power needs. 
This month, however, Zero6 pulled its application for interconnection from the Southwest Power Pool’s queue. The Southwest Power Pool manages the wholesale power market for the central U.S. 
Chris Studer of East River Electric said the cooperative will still build its switching station and use it to serve existing customers.
“We weren’t just building lines to serve Gevo,” Studer said, but he added that the upgrades will ready the area for any large-scale industrial project that might come along.

Maya Homan/Georgia RecorderPlanned Parenthood Southeast’s board of directors announced this week that it would be hiring a law firm to investigate allegations of mismanagement that reproductive health advocates say threatens to undermine the organization’s mission and has alienated donors and partner organizations.
The statement followed the circulation of a “save Planned Parenthood Southeast” petition that advocates say has garnered over 580 signatures, alleging that new leaders have “dismantled” the organization from the inside. The petition, which says it was started by “concerned former members” and supporters of the organization, alleges that Planned Parenthood Southeast has terminated employees dedicated to public policy and organizing and curtailed the organization’s emphasis on abortion services and community outreach under interim CEO Mairo Akposé’s leadership.
“What was once a trusted institution—providing lifesaving reproductive healthcare and fearless advocacy across Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi—is now under immediate and dangerous threat from within,” the petition states. It also calls for the removal or resignation of Akposé, the current board of directors and other leaders hired by Akposé.
Akposé did not respond to multiple requests for comment by phone. 
Planned Parenthood Southeast’s board of directors said in a statement issued Monday that it was made aware of “troubling allegations” against its leadership team the previous week.
“We take these allegations seriously and have retained a nationally recognized law firm to conduct a thorough review,” the board said in the statement. “In the interim, PPSE remains open for business, serving the 15,000+ patients who rely on our services.”
Speaking through a public relations company, the board of directors declined to name the firm, saying they wanted to “ensure the integrity of the process.” 
The board also denied that Planned Parenthood Southeast has taken any steps to reduce its emphasis on abortion services, and said they currently employ two full-time and six part-time public policy and advocacy staff members for the three-state area in a statement issued Thursday.
However, former employees said that PPSE leaders had explicitly called for the organization to downplay its focus on abortion. 
Kaylah Oates-Marable, who was the Georgia state director at Planned Parenthood Southeast until last month, said Akposé “specifically said that we talk about abortion too much and we put too much emphasis on abortion,” during a meeting with national Planned Parenthood leaders. 
Georgia law bans most abortions once fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is usually at about six weeks – and before most women know they are pregnant. Both Alabama and Mississippi implemented total abortion bans in 2022.
Oates-Marable and Stephen Stetson, who was the organization’s director for Alabama and Mississippi until he was terminated from his position last month, both said that the organization’s new leadership questioned the need to attend community events like Pride parades in Atlanta and Birmingham, which were a key part of the organization’s community outreach work. They said leadership would cite budgetary reasons for their decision to pull back from advocacy efforts, even when the efforts in question did not come with many expenses, or were funded by grants.

The turmoil at Planned Parenthood Southeast comes as the entire Planned Parenthood network has increasingly been targeted by Republican members of Congress. In July, President Donald Trump signed his tax and spending bill into law, which included a provision that prevents certain abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood, from receiving Medicaid funding for health care services unrelated to abortion, like annual physicals, cancer screenings and STI testing. Affiliates in multiple states have closed locations in response to the funding cuts, while Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin has announced they will pause abortion services. Other affiliates have vowed to remain open, albeit without Medicaid funding.
Both Stetson and Oates-Marable said the national branch of Planned Parenthood had been made aware of employees’ concerns with PPSE leadership, but that the organization did not step in to address them.
“Each Planned Parenthood local affiliate is an independent non-profit organization with its own board of directors, CEO, and staff,” vice president of communications Angela Vasquez-Giroux said in a statement. “PPFA has no involvement in affiliate hiring or other personnel decisions. The affiliate’s independent board of directors has the sole responsibility for personnel decisions concerning an affiliate CEO or other affiliate staff.”
The outcry has pushed some backers to withhold donations.
Carolyn Smith, an Atlanta resident and longtime Planned Parenthood Southeast donor who has been volunteering with the organization since 2016, said she is rethinking her support.
“I’m not donating to them until I know for sure that leadership of our Planned Parenthood Southeast is leadership that shares a progressive political lens, that supports women’s rights, that supports non-binary rights, that supports the rights of the people that never get a voice,” she said.
Some reproductive rights groups are also beginning to alert their supporters to changes within the organization. 
In a post on Instagram, Planned Parenthood Young Leaders of Savannah, a fundraising group dedicated to engaging future reproductive health advocates, announced that it is disaffiliating from Planned Parenthood Southeast entirely, and has changed its name to the South Georgia Reproductive Justice Coalition. On Oct. 10, the Feminist Center for Reproductive Liberation, a nonprofit that provides reproductive health care in Atlanta, put out a press release arguing that the changes “closely align with Project 2025’s agenda to dismantle reproductive rights and health infrastructure.” 
Stetson, the former Alabama and Mississippi state director, said the problems facing the organization might be a matter of bad leadership rather than ideological divides. But intentional or not, he added, the changes have damaged the organization’s credibility with other reproductive rights groups, leaving rifts that may be difficult to repair. 
“The line between malice and incompetence can be very blurry, and at the end of the day, the result is that the work isn’t getting done,” Stetson said.

Central Vermont Career Center is asking residents to approve a $149 million bond for the construction of a school building.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Central Vermont set to vote on whether to build the state’s first standalone career center.","In an otherwise quiet election year, central Vermont residents are poised to decide on one major issue this November: whether to approve a $149 million bond to construct a new technical education center. 
The Central Vermont Career Center is currently housed at Spaulding High School in Barre. But administrators say that demand for the vocational programs, which range from automotive and plumbing to cosmetology and culinary arts, has long outstripped the available space at the high school. 
For the 2025-26 school year, the career center received 414 applications for only 228 spots. The gap has only widened over the past five years, according to the career center’s data. 
Since 2018, the Central Vermont Career Center District — composed of 18 towns in Washington County — has worked on a plan to construct a new career center building in Graniteville that would expand access to trade programs and graduate more students. If the bond is approved, students could start attending school there beginning in 2029. 
Businesses and policymakers have long raised concerns about Vermont’s shortage of qualified tradespeople and the need for more young people in the workforce. The career center’s superintendent, Jody Emerson, hopes to turn that urgency into support for the bond vote. If the new center is approved, it is poised to become the state’s first vocation school that is not attached to an existing school building or campus. 
“We have thrown money at folks to move to Vermont to build our tax base and to maybe bring in a younger generation,” she said, referring to the pre-pandemic remote worker relocation grant. “And this is actually a way that we could do it, by investing in Vermont and Vermonters.”
But the request for a new high school building may run up against the state’s cost-of-living crisis. Earlier this month, residents at a public forum raised concerns about their ability to afford the higher taxes tied to the bond. 
“I support education in trades and tech. It’s just that that is a lot of money right now for all of us,” said local resident Sue Paxton. “When you can’t even go to the grocery store and spend less than 20 bucks for two items, three items, it’s not a good time.”
Here’s what to know about the tech center, the proposed construction and the cost. 
How would the tech center work?
The career center offers 15 different programs that vary widely in skillset, but there are some aspects that all students have in common. 
Right now, career center students split their time between the center and the academic education requirements at their current school, Emerson said. A typical day begins around 8 a.m. and goes until lunch, when students return to their home districts for afternoon classes. 
That divide is one thing Emerson hopes to change with a new building. 
“I have, every day, been advocating for students to stay and not have to transition,” she said. “I think what we’ve gotten from feedback from students is that the majority of them would prefer to stay and just get everything met here.”
The new building in Graniteville would be able to house full-day instruction and potentially fit 9th- and 10th-graders, she said. Right now, 10th-graders can sign up for an “exploratory” program that allows them to try different programs. A new building could allow the district to offer that to 9th-graders. 
The district has considered expanding in its current home at Spaulding High School, but there were challenges with that option, according to the Frequently Asked Questions section of the career center’s website. The high school has too little parking and not enough room to accommodate larger lab spaces required for hands-on instruction. 
Emerson said the standalone school building could also allow the district to offer more programs like Human Services, or early childhood instruction, natural resources, advanced manufacturing and diesel mechanics. 
But there is a national shortage of skilled-trades instructors, and Emerson admitted it’s something the career center has faced before. 
When a plumbing teacher resigned early in the school year a couple years ago, “we were unable to fill that opening even though we had a full class,” she said. The school was able to get one of the lab assistants an emergency license and contracted with a local plumbing company to send over a part-time instructor, who eventually joined the school permanently. 
Emerson is not too concerned about finding instructors, even if they were to expand their program. The center has been able to train new instructors by having them work alongside seasoned ones, expanding their program in increments each year. 
“We’ve also had lots of outreach from people who are excited about the new center and saying, ‘I’m interested in teaching there if you’re able to open this program,’” she said. 
Sara Walker said she’s seen the benefits of the career center to students firsthand. As a former teacher at U32 High School and Spaulding High School, she said some of her students who struggled to pay attention or connect with class materials “thrived” once they joined the career center. 
“They’re more engaged in their learning and finding more relevance in it,” she said. 
But at a social level, going from one school district to another — even if it meant just walking across the building — could be disorienting for students, she said. “I had a problem with wanderers who would go over to the tech center, because that’s where they wanted to be,” she said. 
What would the new tech center look like?
The proposed location of the new building is 16 Baptist St. in Graniteville, a 27-acre field with a paved road and municipal water and sewer connections, according to the center’s May 2025 presentation. 
Lavallee Brensinger Architects, a consulting firm for the project, designed a mockup plan for the building that would run about 167,000 square feet. The plan incorporates plenty of lab space along with classrooms, offices, a cafeteria and a gym. 
Most of the $149 million bond, roughly $125 million, would go toward construction costs, according to a budget breakdown Emerson provided via email. Another $10 million would be set aside for professional services. 
Equipment and furnishings, including lab equipment, would run about $3 million. Emerson said the center plans to bring over any equipment it can from the Spaulding High School space.
“When we renovated the space where we have our welding program shop now, we made sure that everything we got for that space could be brought with us, and that the air system we bought for it could handle double” the capacity if it was moved to the new building, she said. 
What will it cost taxpayers?
The district partnered with state analysts to figure out how the bond would impact annual property tax bills. Across all the municipalities that are part of the district, the annual impact on a $300,000 home ranged between $99 and $420. 
But Emerson cautioned that the impacts are based on 2025-26 tax data, and that the actual annual cost would vary throughout the life of the bond and depend on upcoming state-level changes to the education system. Basically, “they’re 100% not accurate,” she said. 
An expansion of the tech center would mean raising the center’s operating budget, too. The center’s budget was $5.1 million this fiscal year; the district projects it would need an additional $3 million to cover the expenses of the new building, according to the website FAQs. The center does receive state and federal assistance for its annual budget through technical education support grants. 
Emerson pointed to research elsewhere in the country that found a positive rate of return on the money spent on technical education through better career outcomes for students later in life. 
“If we invest in our students, we have a greater chance of them getting jobs here, staying here, helping to pay back this cost and growing everything here,” she said. “They’re going to be here with their families. They’re going to have kids that come to our education system. They’re going to keep Vermont growing.”
At the same time, she acknowledged that some central Vermont residents may not feel like they can afford to make that investment now, regardless of its future benefits. 
“I think we’re going to learn something from the outcome of this vote. I’m not sure what it’s going to be yet,” she said. 
Emily Walker, a member of the Barre Unified Union School District board, said via email that she was frustrated with the “one-sided” nature of the discussion about cost. “It really speaks to a mindset of scarcity that is holding us back,” she said. 
“The five interconnected factors of mobility that young people need in order to thrive are: a strong academic foundation, career-connected learning, opportunities to build social capital, support in their lives and civic engagement in their community,” she wrote. “The career center speaks to so many of those.”

Kan Wang, an ISU professor of agronomy and biotechnology, and students have released a paper detailing how they investigated the chromosomes of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a bacterium responsible for crown gall disease in plants and the most crucial instrument in genetically modifying crops.

Using gene editing tools they tailored to their needs, Wang said the team manipulated Agrobacterium chromosomes and found that by rearranging its DNA, scientists can impact how well the plant grows, its resiliency and ability to infect plants.
“It’s our bread and butter for biotechnologists — for us,” Wang said.
Agrobacterium enables natural, human-led genetic modification
Evidence of crown gall — a disease implanted by Agrobacterium that causes bulging tumors to grow on plant roots and stems — can be found all over the world, Wang said, with her own family finding the growths on trees in Seattle, Iowa City and the Czech Republic.
The earliest mention of crown gall comes from Italy in the late 1500s, Wang said, and efforts to address the disease in the U.S. go back to the early 1900s. As technology progressed, so did researchers’ work to learn more about Agrobacterium and its mysteries, with Wang starting her own research into the subject during her time studying at the University of Ghent in Belgium in the 1980s.
It was while she was studying as a graduate student that her professor found that Agrobacterium has the ability to “deliver its own DNA into the plant and then integrate into their chromosome,” which is something no other bacteria can do. From there, researchers found they could, through gene editing, “disarm” the genes that cause tumor growth in plants and replace it with a different gene of interest.
It was these findings that paved the way for genetically modified crops, which are changed to become more resilient to stress and attack or encourage certain traits. According to the Food and Drug Administration, most corn and soy grown in the U.S. are GMO crops, as well as cotton, canola and sugar beets.
“All (of) the GMOs on the market were made by Agrobacterium,” Wang said.
Around 2,000 plant species, from black pepper to persimmons to strawberries, have also been identified as N-GMOs, which Wang described as plants that were infected in the past by Agrobacterium and became the dominant crop through domestication or other means.
One example Wang gave of this was the sweet potato. Researchers found out that all domesticated species of the root vegetable have Agrobacterium, but wild species do not. The Agrobacterium caused the sweet potato to bulge, a trait Wang said was likely preferred by those harvesting the vegetable due to it providing more food.
“It’s a horizontal gene transfer, which occurs naturally, and in this case happens to be Agrobacterium,” Wang said.
Untangling chromosomes
Thoughts of the past and lingering questions were drivers in this study, Wang said, as those who made earlier milestones in Agrobacterium research did so without the technology currently available.
The research team started their work by swapping out components of a gene editing tool previously tailored to research E. coli to ensure it would work for their purposes. After that, Wang said, they could “play around” with Agrobacterium chromosomes, deleting certain genes and adding others in.
Wang, a knitter when she isn’t conducting her work, said going through chromosomes is like having to untangle a pile of yarn that got mixed together — time-consuming and complicated.
Agrobacterium has both circular and linear chromosomes, which Wang said caused curiosity as most bacteria have only circular chromosomes. The team also found a variant in the bacteria that had its chromosomes fused together into a large, linear chromosome, and tested it against the original setup and two other variants they created with the gene editing tool.
The variants had different levels of success in infecting plants, Wang said, and varying resiliency. They found that Agrobacterium with fused chromosomes were better at replication and stronger in growth, but could not infect plants as well as variants with separate chromosomes.
Wang’s drive to keep studying Agrobacterium is two-fold, she said, and split between finding real-time solutions to disease and development of technology to improve the tool the bacteria has become.
“The more we know the bacteria, their lifestyle, their biology, maybe we can come up with a more effective biocontrol for them to not to become such a headache for vegetable and fruit farmers right then,” Wang said. “On the other hand, Agrobacterium is also a tool for us. So we want to see, okay, can we learn more from their behavior so we will know how to improve our tools for biotechnology.”
Even with all of the breakthroughs scientists have made with Agrobacterium, Wang said she’s excited to keep diving into the bacteria and other plants it has infected and changed.
Agrobacterium has shown up where it wasn’t expected, such as in hydroponics equipment used to grow tomatoes, and much is still unknown about what triggers the bacteria to leave the soil and enter plants. Wang said next steps are to apply for funding to continue with the work.
“The more we learn (about Agrobacterium’s) ability, their biology, then the more effective we can think about ways to compete (with) the pathogenic bacteria,” Wang said.

Mi Escuelita cuenta con una larga trayectoria ayudando a niños y familias a salir adelante.,"This article is also available in English. Read it here.
El hijo de Elizabeth Gibot, James, se conocía como un niño tranquilo y de buena conducta. Pero Gibot comenzó a notar que James lloraba más y parecía ansioso cuando ella no estaba presente. El también dejó de usar el lenguaje de señas que aprendió de bebé. Ella sabía que algo no estaba bien y se comunicó con su pediatra, pero el doctor no supo cómo ofrecerle ayuda. 
“Dio marcha atrás en todo lo que le había enseñado”, dijo. “Supongo que a los demás les costó mucho darse cuenta, porque nadie conoce a tu hijo mejor que tú”.
Gibot acababa de dejar a su pareja, quien, según ella, la maltrataba física, verbal, emocional y económicamente. Intentó proteger a James cuando la situación se complicaba con su pareja, pero la casa donde vivían era pequeña, lo que lo hacía difícil aislarlo de los malos momentos.
Gibot comenzó a buscar recursos en línea. Encontró Mi Escuelita, un preescolar en San Diego dedicado a estudiantes que han sufrido traumas familiares, como violencia doméstica. Tras reflexionar, inscribió a James.
“Eso me quitó un gran peso de encima, saber que él estará aquí y con profesionales que lo ayudarán de maneras que yo nunca podría. Al menos no en ese momento”, dijo. 



 Elizabeth Gibot y su hijo James Gibot recibieron servicios de salud mental ofrecidos a los estudiantes de Mi Escuelita y sus familias.
Mi Escuelita, fundada en 2006, ofrece servicios de salud mental a estudiantes  y un espacio seguro donde los niños pueden aprender mientras se recuperan. Es considerada líder entre los centros preescolares terapéuticos y se especializa en ayudar estudiantes y sus familias que sufren de trauma. 
Dirigida por la organización sin fines de lucro SBCS, anteriormente conocida como South Bay Community Services, la escuela lleva tiempo ofreciendo servicios a familias necesitadas, incluyendo a aquellas que sufren violencia doméstica. Mi Escuelita surgió de esos programas.
“Se trata de centrarnos realmente en los más pequeños”, dijo Stacey Musso, directora del departamento de salud y bienestar de SBCS.
Además de asegurar que los estudiantes estén listos para el kínder, Mi Escuelita ofrece terapia individual y en grupo. Cuenta con terapeutas disponibles para los estudiantes durante el horario escolar. Angelina Puffelis, supervisora clínica de Mi Escuelita, afirma que este acceso le brinda a su equipo la oportunidad de trabajar con los estudiantes y abordar los problemas a medida que surgen.

Estudiantes se lavan las manos después de una actividad de pintura en Mi Escuelita, San Diego, el 23 de abril de 2025. Muchos de los estudiantes del preescolar son latinos y provienen de familias de bajos recursos. Mi Escuelita ofrece servicios de salud mental tanto a estudiantes como a sus familias, ya que estas relaciones influyen en el desarrollo infantil.
Según un informe reciente, 28 padres de alumnos matriculados en Mi Escuelita el año pasado afirmaron haber estado en múltiples relaciones con la presencia de algún tipo de violencia doméstica. Diecisiete de ellos tuvieron que mudarse o se quedaron sin hogar como consecuencia de la violencia doméstica.
 La evidencia muestra que el programa funciona.
Un informe reciente de la Universidad de California en San Diego reveló que el 82 % de los estudiantes de Mi Escuelita obtuvieron calificaciones superiores al promedio en la prueba de preparación para el kínder, que evalúa la preparación del estudiante para el kínder. Una calificación superior al promedio indica que el estudiante debería necesitar poca atención especial y no presentar dificultades de aprendizaje significantes.
Los estudiantes asisten a Mi Escuelita sin costo y las clases se ofrecen durante todo el año. A cambio, las familias se comprometen a colaborar con los directivos escolares para abordar los problemas de salud mental de forma directa.
“Les pedimos a nuestras familias que entiendan nuestro ambiente. Es tan único”, dijo Lisa Klemp, directora del preescolar Mi Escuelita. “Realmente creemos en esa conexión. Queremos apoyar no solo a nuestros hijos, sino a toda la familia”. 
Los estudiantes participan en un safari en Mi Escuelita el 23 de abril de 2025. Todos los niños que asisten a Mi Escuelita han experimentado traumas relacionados con la familia. 
 Lecciones de la siesta
Mientras algunos estudiantes saboreaban los últimos bocados de sus sándwiches, zanahorias y puré de manzana durante el almuerzo, otros se preparaban para su siguiente actividad. Tiraron la basura, agarraron mantas y se tumbaron en colchonetas distribuidas por el aula. Algunos estudiantes agarraron peluches o escogieron libros para estar cómodos. Los profesores bajaron las luces y pusieron un video de YouTube de gatitos ronroneando mientras sonaban canciones de cuna. 


Aunque la mayoría de los estudiantes se durmieron, a algunos les costó trabajo. Una niña se negó a dormir y lloró cuando le dijeron que no podía correr por el aula. Los profesores intentaron ayudarla ofreciéndole leerle libros o haciendo burbujas, pero no se calmó. Otra niña permaneció inmóvil con los ojos abiertos mirando al techo.  Permaneció así durante la mayor parte de la siesta antes de quedarse dormida.
“Vemos que descansar, calmarse, puede ser un desafío para algunos de nuestros niños”, dijo Klemp. “Creo que han estado en espacios o ambientes que pueden haberlos puesto hiperalerta. Por eso, saber que están en un espacio seguro, donde pueden calmarse y relajarse, es crucial para algunos de ellos”. 
La maestra Ismairy Caldera le lee a un estudiante para ayudarlo a dormir durante la siesta en Mi Escuelita en San Diego el 5 de mayo de 2025. La hora de la siesta puede ser particularmente difícil para los niños que han experimentado un trauma, ya que muchos de ellos permanecen en alerta máxima y les cuesta descansar.

Según la Encuesta Nacional de Salud Infantil, el 63 % de los adultos estadounidenses reportaron haber experimentado al menos una de las experiencias adversas en la infancia antes de los 18 años, como abuso, presenciar violencia o separación familiar. El trauma puede manifestarse de diferentes maneras. Algunos pueden volverse explosivos en su comportamiento, mientras que otros pueden ser tímidos o aislarse. La siesta, en particular, puede ser un desafío para los niños más pequeños.
“En general, de niño, la noche puede ser un tiempo difícil. Y si oyes gritos, portazos, o si la policía llega a tu casa, eso acentúa mucho ese momento de miedo”, dijo Klemp.
El trauma infantil puede no tratarse o considerarse un comportamiento normal, pero sus efectos pueden tener un impacto que puede terminar en abuso de sustancias, trastornos alimentarios, diabetes y enfermedades cardíacas, según la Red Nacional de Estrés Traumático Infantil. El trauma a una joven edad también puede aumentar la probabilidad de encontrarse en el sistema de justicia juvenil y tener un bajo rendimiento académico.
La supervisora clínica Angelina Puffelis y un estudiante juegan durante una sesión de terapia individual en Mi Escuelita, San Diego, el 5 de mayo de 2025. Dado que a los niños les puede resultar difícil expresar sus emociones, Puffelis utiliza la terapia de juego para enternder lo que un niño podría estar experimentando. “Es como estar en un tour”, dijo. “Y para mí, el niño será el guía. Escucho, sigo, pero si tengo una pregunta, ibusco información”.

Último: El muñeco Wally se sienta con los estudiantes durante la ceremonia de graduación de la escuela el 11 de junio de 2025. Los peluches se utilizan para representar escenarios que ayudan a los estudiantes a aprender sobre diferentes emociones y cómo pueden interactuar con los demás.
En Mi Escuelita, cada estudiante participa en sesiones de terapia individual con profesionales clínicos. La terapia con un niño puede ser diferente a una sesión con un adulto. En lugar de sentarse a hablar sobre lo que siente, los terapeutas de Mi Escuelita juegan con los estudiantes y buscan con paciencia señales de emociones más profundas.
“Normalmente hay un tema, y algunos de los aspectos comunes son la protección, la seguridad, el empoderamiento o el superhéroe; lo malo, dijo Puffelis. “Como terapeuta, busco eso. Este es un tema continuo, y si hay cambios en el ambiente familiar, ese tema se refleja en la terapia de juego”. 


Entre estas sesiones individuales, los terapeutas dirigen sesiones en grupos pequeños donde enseñan aspectos de un programa llamado Años Increíbles, que ayuda a los estudiantes a aprender cómo controlar sus emociones. Estas sesiones pueden incluir actividades como leer libros, hablar sobre diferentes tipos de sentimientos o usar peluches para representar una situación que pueda ayudar a liberar las emociones.
Wally, un muñeco de pelo negro y rizado, forma parte del programa. Tiene un lugar especial en las ceremonias anuales de graduación de la escuela. Cada año, un miembro del personal escolar sostiene el muñeco para que pueda “caminar” con los niños. 
 El terapeuta Spencer Mattox lee un libro a los estudiantes durante una sesión de terapia de grupo pequeño en Mi Escuelita en San Diego el 20 de mayo de 2025.

 Generaciones de violencia doméstica
Gibot ha sufrido violencia doméstica a lo largo de su vida. De niña, vio a sus padres y a otros familiares lidiar con los mismos problemas. 
En Mi Escuelita, Gibot se benefició de algunos de los servicios de salud mental que se ofrecen a las familias de los estudiantes. Recibió terapia y asistió a reuniones de padres donde aprendió consejos para apoyar a James, como usar el contacto físico para controlar su cuerpo y usar más palabras de afirmación para fortalecer su autoestima.
En seis meses, Gibot empezó a notar mejoras en su comportamiento. Dijo que desearía que se establecieran más escuelas como Mi Escuelita para evitarles a las familias los trámites burocráticos y tener que comunicarse con diversos especialistas en diferentes lugares.
 “Lo ideal sería que la norma fuera como Mi Escuelita, sobre todo porque hay muchos niños que podrían beneficiarse de ella”, dijo. 
La maestra Viviana Vásquez trabaja con estudiantes durante una clase en Mi Escuelita en San Diego el 23 de abril de 2025. Todo el personal de Mi Escuelita debe completar un curso de 40 horas ofrecida por SBCS para ayudarlos a equiparse con el conocimiento y las habilidades necesarias para apoyar a los sobrevivientes de violencia doméstica. 
 ¿Qué pasa después de Mi Escuelita?
Cuando los estudiantes salen de Mi Escuelita, ingresan a distritos escolares que pueden ofrecer servicios o intervenciones de salud mental, pero generalmente no tan directos como están acostumbrados. Si un maestro o miembro del personal cree que un estudiante podría estar lidiando con problemas de salud mental, puede recomendarle que consulte con un consejero escolar o un trabajador social. A partir de ahí, las autoridades escolares pueden derivar a la familia del estudiante a proveedores de salud externos ofrecidos por organizaciones comunitarias o servicios de salud locales del condado. 


Hilaria Bauer, jefa de servicios de primera infancia en Kidango , una organización sin fines de lucro del Área de la Bahía, dijo que otros educadores están comenzando a adoptar conceptos de Mi Escuelita, especialmente después de la pandemia de COVID-19.
 “Al regresar a las aulas y a actividades más regulares, empezamos a ver cómo ese aislamiento, ese trauma, afectó a nuestras familias y a los niños”, dijo.
Pero construir el ambiente de aprendizaje único que SBCS creó en Mi Escuelita puede ser difícil de copiar.
 “Es una idea maravillosa y poderosa. Supongo que también es muy costosa”, dijo Bauer. 





 Los estudiantes participan en una ceremonia de graduación en Mi Escuelita en San Diego el 11 de junio de 2025.
El costo de operar Mi Escuelita es de $1.3 millones cada año; se financia con una combinación de fuentes locales, estatales y federales, así como donantes privados, según SBCS.
 Además de la financiación, Bauer afirma que encontrar el personal adecuado es otro obstáculo a considerar. Por ejemplo, puede ser difícil encontrar profesores con la licencia necesaria para impartir terapia, además de experiencia en el aula.
Aun así, Bauer afirma que hay beneficios a largo plazo de la implementación de ciertos conceptos que se ofrecen en Mi Escuelita. Los datos parecen respaldar su afirmación. Un estudio de la Universidad de California en San Diego, que analizó el rendimiento de los estudiantes durante varios años, mostró que quienes asistieron a Mi Escuelita tendían a obtener puntuaciones iguales o superiores en matemáticas, lectura y escritura, en comparación con otros estudiantes del distrito escolar primario de Chula Vista.
“Podemos gastar menos en programas de intervención e instalaciones alternativas”, dijo Bauer. “Habrá menos ausentismo escolar, menos conductas graves, expulsiones o programas alternativos, y todas esas iniciativas de ‘corrección’ si realmente nos centramos en el momento de la vida del niño que realmente marca la diferencia”. 
 Los estudiantes interpretan una canción durante una ceremonia de graduación en Mi Escuelita en San Diego el 11 de junio de 2025.
James comenzó en el kínder en agosto. y celebró su cumpleaños en septiembre. Le va bien, dijo Gibot.
 Mientras se preparaba para el kínder, Gibot dijo que le preocupaba lo que pudiera pasar. Klemp le aseguró que ella y James seguirían recibiendo apoyo de SBCS. Eso la hizo sentir más segura.
 “Ha aprendido mucho y ha adquirido habilidades que me gustaría poder enseñarle. Pero, bueno, ambos aprendimos”, dijo.
 James fue uno de los estudiantes que se graduó de Mi Escuelita en mayo. Gibot, sentada con el resto de los asistentes a la ceremonia, observó cómo su hijo cantaba canciones con sus compañeros, animaba a sus amigos y recibía un pequeño diploma.
Fue muy emotivo para mí. Pensé: “¡Wow! No tiene miedo. No siente tantas emociones diferentes”, dijo. “Lo hizo todo solo. Y ver cómo crece esa independencia es simplemente hermoso”.

Roughly 150 people stayed at an emergency shelter at the Alaska National Guard Readiness Center. Others stayed with family or friends or in accommodations arranged by the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation in Bethel.
On Thursday morning, evacuees lined up to board the second flight to Anchorage, landing at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. Emergency shelters have been set up at Alaska Airlines Center, the Egan Center, and city recreation centers at Spenard and Fairview.
An estimated 2,000 evacuees are expected in Anchorage by Friday, said Mayor Suzanne LaFrance.
Dolly Martin, 19, her mother and four siblings were headed to stay with family.
“My emotions are all over the place,” she said.
Another flight was scheduled for Thursday afternoon as new evacuees arrive from Kipnuk and Kwigillingok.
Seventy-five people were expected to be picked up in Kwigillingok on Thursday. In Kipnuk, the evacuation is largely complete, said Lieutenant Colonel Brendan Holbrook, commander of the 207th Aviation Troop Command with the Alaska Army National Guard.
“Kipnuk is evacuated for everyone that wants to be evacuated. There are about 50 or 100 that stayed behind, that don’t want to come out,” Holbrook said, and estimates there are 200 to 300 people in Kwigillingok who are staying there.
The storm killed one woman in Kwigillingok, 67-year-old Ella Mae Kashatok, and left two family members missing, Vernon Pavil and Chester Kashatok. The local search and rescue effort is still ongoing, led by volunteers and village public safety officers with the Association of Village Council Presidents.

(Pool photo by Zachary Boyden-Holmes/Courtesy of Iowa PBS)Though there have been many shake-ups in Iowa races heading into the 2026 campaign season, Republican candidates have largely kept their fundraising leads in Iowa’s U.S. Senate and House races, according to the most recent Federal Election Commission reports.
Iowa will have open races for two U.S. House seats, as well as for governor and U.S. Senate in 2026 – a large change from previous recent election cycles, in which Republican incumbents were largely able to hold on to their seats. Democrats hope the shifting campaign landscape, alongside discontent among voters over Trump administration actions and GOP-led bills like the budget reconciliation measure, will allow their party’s candidates to break the full GOP hold of Iowa’s federal delegation.
Still, Republican candidates outraised Democrats in most of Iowa’s races for federal office in the most recent FEC filing period from July 1 through Sept. 30.
There was one exception – Democrat Christina Bohannan outraised incumbent U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks in the 1st District, according to the October reports, as she aims for a rematch in 2026.
Bohannan, who unsuccessfully ran against Miller-Meeks in the 2022 and 2024 elections, raised nearly $1.06 million in the most reporting period and ended with $1.6 million cash on hand. In comparison, her opponents to become the Democratic nominee, Travis Terrell and Taylor Wettach, raised $12,940 and $429,099 respectively.
In a recent statement, Bohannan thanked her supporters for helping her campaign work to flip Iowa’s 1st Congressional District.
“Miller-Meeks’ campaign is well-funded by big corporations, billionaires, and party bosses because she does their bidding in Washington DC,” Bohannan said. “We’re showing that we can win this race the right way and for the right reasons – with the support of hardworking people who are ready to get costs down, defend the middle class, and actually put Iowa first. And we’re just getting started.”
Though Bohannan raised more than Miller-Meeks, who reported $806,731 in fundraising during the period, the incumbent Republican retains a lead in reserve funds with $2.62 million cash on hand.
Miller-Meeks’ campaign said in a statement Democrats are targeting the seat in vain, as her numbers show “best-funded campaign IA-01 has ever seen.”
“In 2024, Democrats outspent me by millions and still lost because Iowans know I fight for them, not for D.C. elites or the establishment,”  Miller-Meeks said. “With the resources we have built, we are ready to share our record, and WIN again for Iowa and American workers, farmers, and families.”
Nunn outraises Democratic challengers in 3rd District
Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District, currently represented by Republican Rep. Zach Nunn, is also a seat targeted by national Democrats as a potential pick-up. His campaign reported raising $524,657 in the most recent reporting period, ending with $1.6 million in reserve funding.
Though Nunn raised less than the leading candidates in Iowa’s 1st District, he still raised more than the two Democrats competing to take him on in the 2026 election — state Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, and former House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst. Nunn’s Campaign Manager Brendan Duffy said in a statement the fundraising numbers send “a clear message,” that Nunn is “battle-tested, well-prepared, and ready to defend the seat from far-left activists pushing an out-of-touch, radical agenda.”
“Iowans trust Zach Nunn, and as one of the top ten most bipartisan members of Congress, he will continue to build a safer, more prosperous future for every hardworking Iowa family,” Duffy said in a statement.
Trone Garriott was the closest to Nunn’s fundraising totals, ending the third quarter having raised $437,684 and keeping $598,212 cash on hand. Konfrst’s fundraising totals were lower this period, raising $175,556 — less than half of Trone Garriott — and ending with $195,333 in cash on hand. Trone Garriott’s campaign stated the recent FEC filing “clearly demonstrates that Trone Garriott is the frontrunner to take on Zach Nunn.”
Former state lawmaker Joe Mitchell emerges as top fundraiser in 2nd District
In September, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst announced she will not seek a third term in the Senate. The news was shortly followed by U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, a Republican who currently represents Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District, stating she will run for the Senate seat.
Political forecasters have predicted some Iowa congressional races, particularly in the 1st and 3rd districts, may be among the most competitive in the nation. Hinson’s move to run for U.S. Senate also led Cook Political Report to move its rating for Iowa’s 2nd District from “solid Republican” to “likely Republican.”
Though there is not an incumbent Republican competing in Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District after Hinson’s exit, Republican candidate Joe Mitchell, a former state legislator, raised more than both Democratic and Republican competitors. Mitchell reported fundraising $407,555 during the period and having $405,883 cash on hand. More than $307,000 of this funding came from outside contributors, in addition to Mitchell loaning his campaign $100,000.
Mitchell’s campaign called the fundraising figures “record-breaking,” covering three weeks between when he announced his campaign and the reporting period ended.
“The campaign has several fundraising events scheduled this year to continue building the resources necessary to win in November,” Mitchell said in a statement.
Other Republican candidates in the 2nd District race include Iowa Sen. Charlie McClintock, R-Alburnett, who reported raising $14,307. Former U.S. Rep. Rod Blum, who dropped out of the race Monday, reported raising $250,181, with most funding coming from a personal loan. Rep. Shannon Lundgren, R-Peosta, who entered the race Sept. 23, did not file a report.
The 2nd District Democratic primary field saw more competitive fundraising numbers. Iowa Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque, led among Democrats in the most recent reporting period with $273,649 raised and $226,300 in cash on hand. Clint Twedt-Ball, the founder of the nonprofit Matthew 25, raised a similar amount at $218,815, and ending the period with $152,398 in reserves.
Twedt-Ball thanked his supporters in a statement, saying 90% of contributions came from Iowans.
“As I’ve traveled the district, I’ve heard from countless Iowans that it’s time for new leaders, instead of career politicians, to address the rising costs of healthcare, housing and other basics,” Twedt-Ball said. “Our campaign is about building a new kind of politics: lighting the way to a stronger, more affordable future for our state.”
Kathy Dolter, the former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College, reported raising $39,109 during the third quarter, and Guy Morgan, a Democrat from Boone, raised $2,413.
James emphasized in a news release that Hinson’s exit from the race gives Democrats a solid opportunity to flip Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District.
“This outpouring of support sends a clear message that our campaign has the momentum to win in November,” James said in a statement about her fundraising. “We’re building a well resourced campaign that will listen to voters in every community in the 2nd district and go fight on their behalf in Washington D.C.”
 Siouxland Chamber of Commerce president leads GOP field in fundraising for 4th District
In Iowa’s 4th Congressional District, a longtime Republican stronghold, is another open race in 2026, as U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra considers a bid for governor following Gov. Kim Reynolds’ decision not to seek reelection in 2026.
Feenstra has not officially announced a gubernatorial campaign but is not expected to run for reelection in the 4th District. He reported raising $24,854 during the FEC reporting period and having $1.32 million in cash reserves.
In the campaign to replace Feenstra, Siouxland Chamber of Commerce President Chris McGowan led the GOP primary field with $372,285 in fundraising.
In a news release from McGowan’s campaign, Katie Delzell, who serves as the campaign’s fundraising strategist, said the FEC filings show he is the strongest candidate to take over from Feenstra in 2026.
“Chris McGowan’s early success signals an extraordinarily strong show of support for his candidacy from across the 4th District, and this has sent a powerful message, not only to Iowans, but to the political leadership in our nation’s capital,” Delzell said. “This significant accomplishment has solidified Chris as the clear front-runner in the race to represent Iowa’s 4th congressional district.”
Ryan Rhodes, the founder of the Iowa Tea Party, reported raising $183,205 in the third quarter with $100,000 coming from a loan. Former House Majority Leader Matt Windschitl reported raising $67,425. Republican Christian Schlaefer, a software consultant who launched his campaign in September, did not file an FEC report.
Among Democrats, former state Rep. Dave Dawson raised $36,194 during the reporting period, and Ashley WolfTornabane, a stay-at-home mother from Storm Lake, reported raising $6,122. Democrat Stephanie Steiner, a retired nurse running for the 4th District seat, did not file a fundraising report.

 Hinson leads in U.S. Senate race fundraising
Hinson quickly gained sizable financial and structural support in her campaign to follow Ernst in representing Iowa in the Senate. Shortly after entering the race, the Republican representative was endorsed by President Donald Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chair Tim Scott, alongside many other Senate and Iowa GOP leaders, quickly solidifying her place as the likely GOP nominee for the seat.
Her fundraising totals show a similar base of support. Hinson raised $1.72 million during the reporting period, outpacing her opponents from both parties. She also ends the period with $4.05 million in reserves — a total that includes funding transferred from her U.S. House campaign.
Hinson’s campaign celebrated the fundraising totals, with Campaign Director Addie Lavis saying in a statement the FEC reports show “Iowans are fired up to elect Ashley as their next senator.”
“Ashley’s commonsense message — cutting taxes for working families, lowering the cost of prescription drugs and healthcare, securing our border and keeping our communities safe, and ensuring China can’t buy up Iowa farmland — is resonating with Iowans in every corner of this state,” Lavis said. “This will be a fight, but Ashley Hinson is putting in the work to be Iowa’s next U.S. Senator and keep all of Iowa red.”
There are two other Republicans running for the Senate seat — former state lawmaker Jim Carlin and Joshua Smith. Carlin reported raising $45,492 during the filing period, while Smith did not file a report.
There is a more competitive primary field among Democrats for the 2026 race. Iowa Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs, reported raising more than $1 million since launching his campaign in August — outraising the other Democrats in the field. He ends the quarter with $651,981 in cash on hand.
Turek’s campaign said the fundraising was the “record for the most money raised by a first-time Democratic Senate candidate in their opening quarter in the race,” and shows his campaign has strong support from Iowans.
“This campaign isn’t powered by corporate PACs — it’s powered by teachers, nurses, farmers, and working families from every corner of Iowa who are ready for a leader who will fight for them,” Campaign Manager Brendan Koch said in a statement. “Josh is building a movement, and this milestone proves Iowans are ready for something different.”
Though Turek raised the most during the reporting period, his overall fundraising falls short of state Sen. Zach Wahls’ total for the election cycle at $1.3 million. Turek raised more than Wahls, who reported $646,658 in fundraising and an ending balance for $585,045 for the FEC filing period.
Wahls called attention to receiving contributions from Iowans in all 99 state counties alongside endorsements from six Iowa labor unions in a news release on the fundraising totals.
“Our campaign’s strength comes from the people of Iowa—not corporate PACs or Washington insiders,” Wahls said in a statement. “Iowans are responding to our message of taking on the corrupt political establishment—of both parties—and standing up for the working families who make this state great. That’s how we’ll build the campaign to defeat Ashley Hinson and deliver real change for Iowa.”
Former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Director Nathan Sage reported raising $410,501 during the most recent period, bringing his total for the election cycle to $1.12 million.
Des Moines School Board President Jackie Norris, who ended her campaign Thursday, reported raising $345,621 in the most recent FEC filing and ending the period with $227,320 cash on hand.

Shelby County officials late Friday filed suit against Gov. Bill Lee and other state leaders, seeking an immediate halt to the deployment of the National Guard in Memphis, which they say violates the Tennessee constitution and state law. 
The lawsuit, filed in Davidson County Chancery Court, seeks a temporary injunction to keep members of the Tennessee National Guard from patrolling the streets of Memphis while the court challenge remains ongoing. A hearing has been set for Nov. 3.
Davidson Counselor Chancellor Patricia Moskall late Friday denied a request for a preliminary injunction, a separate legal mechanism sought in the case, saying lawyers bringing suit had not demonstrated an “immediate or irreparable injury, loss, or damage” would occur before the Nov. 3 hearing. 
Beginning October 10, guardsmen have been deployed to the city as part of the Memphis Safe Task Force established by President Donald Trump. More than 1,000 members of state and federal law enforcement agencies — among them the Tennessee Highway Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security — have conducted traffic stops and made arrests in support of the effort. State officials have yet to release the exact number of guardsmen and other law enforcement who are working as part of the task force.
As of Friday morning, the task force had made 1,044 arrests, a spokesperson for the U.S. Marshals Service, the task force’s lead agency, said.
But the arrests have placed strains on local resources, particularly local detention centers that were already at, or above capacity, before task force began. Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris on Tuesday declared a state of emergency to enable him to bypass normal budgetary rules to respond to the increased demands.
“Relief is needed urgently,” the 24-page complaint states. “National Guard members are supposed to help address emergencies in Tennessee communities, not cause them.”
“The Court should not stand by while the Governor asserts military power to run roughshod over Tennessee law,” it states.
The lawsuit cites a 2021 opinion by former Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery III that concluded, under the Tennessee Constitution, that “only circumstances amounting to a rebellion or invasion permit the governor to call out the militia, and even then, the legislature must declare, by law, that the public safety requires it.”
The lawsuit also cites state law that entrusts local officials to determine whether there has been a breakdown in law and order requiring the presence of the guard. 
“Yet…the National Guard deployment was made unilaterally, not at the request of Local officials, but over their objections,” the lawsuit said. 
Tennessee Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Nashville democrat, criticized Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti earlier this month for withdrawing Slatery’s 2021 opinion and replacing it with his own revised opinion in April 2024, defining the guard as a militia “only for purposes of federal law.”
Skrmetti responded that Slatery’s opinion was withdrawn in April 2024 because it didn’t “accurately reflect the state of the law.” He added that the office withdraws opinions when it finds the state of the law has changed or the analysis was incorrect.
A spokesperson for Gov. Bill Lee did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit.
The lawsuit was brought by Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, state Rep. Gabby Salina and Rep. G.A. Hardaway, both Memphis Democrats, Yarbro, a Nashville Democrat, and three members of the Shelby County Board of Commissioners.
In addition to Lee, the lawsuit names Skrmetti and Major General Warner Ross III of the Tennessee National Guard.

(U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Dylan Maher)South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden on Friday recognized a remotely piloted aircraft squadron at Ellsworth Air Force Base for its role in a June U.S. military operation that officials say helped end a 12-day war between Israel and Iran.
A news release from the governor said that “for the safety of all those involved,” Friday was “the first day the governor could publicly acknowledge” the squadron’s involvement in the operation.
The 89th Attack Squadron remotely pilots MQ-9 Reaper drones from ground control facilities at the base near Rapid City. In June, the squadron participated in Operation Midnight Hammer, which culminated in strikes on Iranian nuclear sites ordered by President Donald Trump, according to the governor’s office.
The operation destroyed three Iranian nuclear sites, according to statements from the Trump administration. Trump said at the time that the strikes were intended to end Iran’s nuclear weapons program, calling them a “spectacular military success.”
Rhoden praised the squadron for what he described as “heroic service and sacrifice in defense of America and our freedoms.” He declared Friday as “89th Attack Squadron Appreciation Day” in South Dakota. 
The governor’s office said the squadron conducted 177 hours of intelligence operations and provided information that helped safeguard more than 17,000 U.S. troops and informed the president’s decision-making on the military strikes.
Rhoden presented the recognition during a ceremony at Ellsworth Air Force Base.

Legislative committee advances two of five measures aimed at maintaining delivery services. Critics questioned whether one of the two, which set off a lengthy abortion debate, belonged in the discussion.
The post As Wyoming maternity care continues to erode, lawmakers mull ‘band-aids’ appeared first on WyoFile .","When Banner Health announced in September that it would pause labor and delivery services at Platte County Hospital in Wheatland, it marked the fifth Wyoming hospital in recent history to shutter a birth facility.
Like facilities before it in Evanston, Rawlins, Kemmerer and Riverton, the hospital called it a difficult decision. Provider challenges like physician recruitment, declining births and profitability in Wyoming are steep. The result is a loss of services and large gaps in service here. 
As lawmakers on the Legislature’s Joint Labor, Health and Social Services Committee spent most of Thursday wading through measures aimed at fortifying maternity care in the state, they acknowledged that the trend will be difficult to reverse. There were many references to the draft bills as “band-aids” that could perhaps keep maternity care limping along in its current state. 
Ultimately, the panel advanced two of the five measures. The only draft bill to receive unanimous support would authorize freestanding birth centers to be covered by Medicaid for births handled by midwives. 
The second bill that advanced, a divisive measure that ignited lengthy debate, would set rules and regulations aimed at protecting pregnancy centers, which are typically intended to discourage women from seeking abortions. The bill would prohibit the state or any municipality from compelling a pregnancy center to perform abortions, provide abortion medication or counsel in favor of abortion, among other acts. 
Critics wondered if the measure even belonged in the discussion of fortifying maternity care. 
“Please abandon this misguided bill,” said Britt Boril, executive director of WyoUnited, a reproductive rights organization. “It in no way helps us solve our issues with the maternity care deserts that I know we have a shared desire to alleviate. In fact, it aims to shield unregulated pregnancy centers from oversight.”
The committee advanced the measure on a vote of 12-2. That puts it on track to be among the committee-sponsored bills going into the 2026 session, which are historically more likely to pass.
The problem
A dearth of maternal health care has made pregnancy and childbirth increasingly tricky in widening swaths of Wyoming. That means families going to extraordinary lengths to deliver babies; doctors spread thin or on the brink of burnout and hospitals juggling the complicated cost formulas in thinking about maintaining labor wards.
If the trend continues, experts worry that mothers will put off or forgo prenatal care, travel long distances in difficult weather or give birth in emergency rooms with nurses who aren’t trained in labor and delivery, which could have dangerous or even deadly results. Births in the state, meanwhile, continue to fall.

The erosion also poses existential threats to communities, as adequate health care is crucial to attracting young families to rural towns, state leaders say. And though lawmakers and health care professionals have been searching for solutions, no single answer has emerged.
Wyoming isn’t alone, and legislative staff furnished the Labor Committee with a report highlighting strategies implemented in other states to improve maternal health care. They include expanding Medicaid to cover doula services or permit telehealth; creating incentive programs for maternal health care professionals; and integrating midwives into the state health care system.
Wyoming does grant certified nurse midwives a full and independent practice authority and provides midwives with a 100% Medicaid reimbursement rate.
The measures before the committee on Thursday represented an array of strategies to ease operations and costs for maternal services. 
What advanced, what didn’t
The committee first considered a bill that would provide for increased reimbursement for obstetric physician services and critical access hospitals. That includes reimbursing OB-GYN services at 105% of the current Medicare rate. Critical access hospitals that offer labor and delivery services authorized under Medicaid, meanwhile, would be reimbursed for inpatient services at 100% of the actual cost for the services. 
The measure could help with physician retention and family practice residencies that serve Medicaid patients, Cheyenne OB-GYN Jacques Beveridge said. “I think it could go a long way,” he said. 
The Wyoming Medical Society also supported it. “We see it as a stabilization measure,” said Executive Director Sheila Bush, noting that it could be one of many strategies aimed at making shifts, even small ones. Eric Boley with the Wyoming Hospital Association echoed that.

“I think this is one opportunity to work on a much bigger problem and a bigger process,” Boley said. “I think this is an important bill if we want to sustain what we currently have, but it will not fix those [facilities] that have closed.”
Lawmakers, apparently wary of increased state expenses, did not support the bill. It died on a vote of 6 to 8.
They did, however, support a bill regarding extending Medicaid coverage to freestanding birth centers. These facilities are designed to provide a comfortable setting for uncomplicated births. They are not part of hospitals, but often do have partnerships with nearby hospitals or doctors in case more specialized care, such as a cesarean section, is needed.
Birthing centers’ appeal relates in part to expenses. They come with lower fixed costs because they specialize in vaginal births without medical complications, need less equipment and employ midwives, who are paid less. They could establish in regions with delivery service gaps as an option for straightforward births. 
The committee was favorable. 
“I look at this program as bringing a little rain to the maternity desert,” said Sen. Lynn Hutchings, R-Cheyenne.
Lawmakers did not advance a related bill, which would mandate private insurance coverage parity for freestanding birthing center services. 
Abortion debate 
The pregnancy center bill took up most of the committee’s time. Sen. Charlie Scott, R-Casper, noted that the document’s format itself was unusual. “Is this a national bill that has been copied?” he asked. 
The 12-page bill draft includes much preamble, including statements about national events. It prohibits municipalities from interfering in specified pregnancy centers operations, and would impose severe penalties. Under the bill, a pregnancy center or any person aggrieved by a violation of the act can sue for up to three times the actual damages sustained. 
To present the bill as a maternity care solution is disingenuous, critics said Thursday. Pregnancy centers disguise themselves as medical facilities when their true intent is to advocate against abortions, Boril of WyoUnited said. 
Emma Laurant urged the committee to stop spending energy on divisive abortion measures “and actually support increasing practical solutions, such as expanding birthing centers and attracting OBs to the state to take care of Wyoming women and their tangible health and any subsequent children they choose to have.”

Valerie Berry, executive director of LifeChoice Pregnancy Center in Cheyenne, defended her center as a sound medical facility that provides quality care from licensed professionals.  
Sen. Scott wondered if there is a current crisis in Wyoming regarding pregnancy centers and threats. Berry said they are happening around the U.S., though she isn’t aware of issues in Cheyenne. 
Denise Burke, senior counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom, said the bill “was designed to protect Wyoming’s pregnancy centers from censorship or discrimination simply because they do not offer, refer for or counsel in favor for abortion, abortion-inducing drugs or contraceptives.”
Burke, who resides in Kansas, also said she isn’t aware of any potential threats in Wyoming. 
Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, R-Cody, who chairs the Wyoming Freedom Caucus and was lead sponsor on the abortion ban now before the state high court, pushed back on Scott’s question of the bill’s provenance. She drafted a previous version of it with staff, she said, and it’s modeled specifically for Wyoming.

Sen. Sam Douglass, R-Orleans, said he will resign after bigoted comments he and his wife made in a Young Republicans group chat were leaked this week. 
In a long statement released Friday afternoon, the first-term state legislator apologized for the “offense” his comments caused and described hateful messages he’d received in recent days. At the bottom, he announced that he would resign effective Monday at noon.
“I know that this decision will upset many, and delight others, but in this political climate I must keep my family safe,” he wrote.

A Politico report Tuesday revealed remarks Young Republican leaders, including Douglass and his wife, Briana Douglass, made in a Telegram group chat.
Following Politico’s story, Vermont elected officials across the political spectrum quickly called for Douglass’ resignation, with Gov. Phil Scott, himself a Republican, leading the charge. 
In a June exchange between former New York State Young Republicans co-chair Bobby Walker and chair Peter Giunta, Walker mentioned a mutual friend who had dated an “obese Indian woman,” according to the report. Giunta replied that the woman was not Indian, to which Douglass responded: “She just didn’t bathe often.”
After Douglass made a comment about a peer’s Jewish colleague potentially making a procedural mistake, Douglass’ wife, a Young Republicans committee member, responded, stating, “you’re giving nationals to (sic) much credit and expecting the Jew to be honest.”
The Politico exposé revealed members of the Young Republicans Telegram chat referring to rape as “epic” and expressing “love” for Hitler, in addition to a slew of other racist and homophobic comments. 
After the news broke, Douglass did not respond to media inquiries but released a statement that denounced and condemned the comments in the Politico story and said he was still deciding what to do. He sought to distance himself from the group chat but did not apologize for his involvement, instead telling his constituents he regretted the unwanted attention the story had caused. 
Despite the widespread calls for Douglass’ immediate resignation, including from other Republicans in the Northeast Kingdom, Vermont GOP Chair Paul Dame was a rare exception. Dame called the group chat “shocking and grotesque” but said Douglass’ comments were not bigoted or racist. 
“If Sen. Douglass can not meet the minimum standard for informing the public about issues he is involved in, then I will also join the Governor and legislative colleagues in calling on him to resign,” he said in the press release.
Hours later, though, the executive committee of the state GOP issued its own press release retracting Dame’s statement. 
“The Vermont Republican Party (“VTGOP”) Executive Committee stands united with Governor Phil Scott and the Republican Senate and House leadership and calls for the immediate resignation of Senator Sam Douglass,” they wrote in the press release. “The VTGOP Executive Committee condemns the hateful, racist, and antisemitic messages revealed in a national Young Republican group chat.”
In an interview this week Vice President J.D. Vance called the exposed messages stupid jokes made by “kids.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)The University of Louisville has suspended a student group supporting Palestinian rights after President Gerry Bradley’s Oct. 10 inaugural speech was interrupted by protesters, some of whom shouted “Genocide Gerry” and carried flags.
Five UofL students and two former students were issued citations on charges of criminal trespass, according to a statement issued Thursday by Louisville Students for Justice in Palestine. The statement said the group is “interim suspended.”
According to a video the student group posted online, a protestor can be heard yelling “Genocide Gerry” during Bradley’s speech. 
After the suspension, the group rallied on campus Oct. 13, calling on university administrators to reinstate it and demanding that UofL divest investments in Israel. A student was issued a citation when university police stopped protesters who were setting up an encampment, the group said. In its statement, the group said university police “violently struck down, breaking through a human chain of students, faculty, and community members to remove tents and canopies.” 
UofL spokesman John Karman said that as of Friday, Louisville Students for Justice in Palestine remains suspended. 
Bradley sent a campus-wide message on Oct. 13 saying the university is “a strong advocate for its students’ rights to free speech and free assembly,” but added that Louisville Students for Justice in Palestine “has been warned multiple times about conduct on campus.” 
“Our free speech policies allow students to take a position on issues that inspire them and to use their voices to raise concerns, support others and call for change,” Bradley wrote. “They are not allowed, however, to disrupt university business or activities or to endanger their fellow students or faculty and staff. There are consequences for students and other members of the UofL community who do not follow university policies and directives.” 
The UofL Board of Trustees appointed Bradley, who was UofL’s executive vice president and university provost, as president in the spring following the departure of former President Kim Schatzel.
In its statement, Louisville Students for Justice in Palestine issued demands of UofL administration: 

“Disclose all direct and indirect investments from the university’s endowment by companies that are complicit in Israel’s genocide
Disclose all university partnerships with companies complicit in Israel’s apartheid and genocide in Gaza
Make all of these disclosures publicly available and accessible.
Remove all investments in companies that are complicit in the Israeli genocide of Gazans and their apartheid state.
Dissolve all partnerships with companies complicit in the Israeli apartheid.”

In an Instagram post, Louisville Students for Justice in Palestine said Bradley “spoke highly of free speech and hailed UofL as a morally righteous institution, all the while he refuses dialogue with his students, forcing them to disrupt, and then repressing and punishing students afterwards.” 
“UofL has exposed itself for what it is, an institution blindly committed to zionism and genocide before its students,” the group said at the time. 
The tension on the Kentucky university campus comes as colleges nationwide grapple with balancing students’ rights to protest. Campus demonstrations were held across the country in 2024. 
Last week, a group of students in support of Palestinian rights filed a lawsuit against the University of South Florida, claiming the university violated members’ constitutional rights after expelling one student and disciplining others.
State lawmakers who are part of the Kentucky Israel Caucus issued a letter to university presidents in 2023 calling on them to sign a statement that “condemns Hamas and affirms the humanity of Israelis and Palestinians alike.” That letter said that Schatzel, the former UofL president, had signed such a statement. 
Earlier this year, the Kentucky General Assembly enacted a law banning diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at the state’s public universities.

(Photo by Marc Piscotty/Getty Images)Among the dozens of petitions the U.S. Supreme Court rejected this week was one from a Sarasota resident who challenged Florida’s closed primary election system.
Michael J. Polelle is a former attorney and emeritus professor at the University of Illinois Chicago School of Law. An independent voter, he was upset after moving to Sarasota in 2012 and learning that as a nonparty-affiliated (NPA) voter, he was shut out of county commission primaries because of the state’s closed system.
Florida is one of a minority of states with closed primaries. That system locks out the nearly 3.4 million Floridians registered as NPA, as well as 443,000 more who are registered with a minor political party — more than 28% of the electorate.
In a phone interview this week, Polelle, 87, told the Phoenix that while he was bothered by not being able to vote in the primaries in 2012, he wasn’t willing to do anything about it at the time. But he said his feelings changed after the 2016 election, when he realized how “fragile” the election system was, and how it gravitates towards polarization.

“But then what really struck me is that I never realized that my real estate taxes go to pay for these primaries that I can’t vote in. And that makes no sense to me,” he said.
Without the aid of a law firm but with assistance from some of the legal contacts he’s maintained in Chicago, he filed a lawsuit in 2022 in the U.S. Middle District Court of Florida challenging the state’s ban on open primaries, saying it violates his rights under the First Amendment and Equal Protection Clause to political free speech and association. Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd and Sarasota County Supervisor of Elections Ron Turner were listed as defendants.
U.S. District Judge Steven D. Merryday dismissed the case in November 2022, ruling that Polelle lacked standing and had failed to state a claim for relief. Merryday also found that Florida’s interest in preventing unaffiliated voters’ potential to undermine a political party’s candidate-selection process outweighed his desire to vote in a partisan primary election, especially given the minimal burdens that Florida law imposes on voters who wish to join or switch political parties.
He then filed an appeal last year with the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In an 112-page ruling released in March, a three-judge panel rejected his arguments.
The ruling said that Polelle had “both the right to a meaningful vote and the right not to be associated with certain political groups and messages. And Florida’s closed primary burdens those rights.” They added that “Florida’s system of closed primary elections may put Polelle to a ‘Hobson’s Choice,’ but it does not do so unconstitutionally.”
Two of the three justices did write that Polelle had standing to sue the Sarasota County Supervisor of Elections, which Polelle considers “a big win, because prior cases said that people like me, who are not affiliated with a party, don’t even have rights to sue.”
He petitioned for the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case, with the Independent Voter Project, Open Primaries, and the Forward Party filing a joint amicus brief in support of his lawsuit, which was denied earlier this week.
Polelle cited in his legal brief that polls show there are more voters who call themselves independent than do a Republican or Democrat. A 2024 Gallup survey showed that 43% of Americans considered themselves independents, with 28% calling themselves Democrat and 28% Republican.
Meanwhile, the Florida Democratic Party is engaging in an internal discussion about whether to open future primary elections to NPA voters. Polelle said he received an email from Democratic chair Nikki Fried as his lawsuit was pending, and also heard from Mitchell Berger, an attorney with the party, who asked to see his legal briefs. Polelle says he’s never heard back from him, “so I figured they haven’t really decided what they’re going to do.”

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas lawmakers expressed concern about the state of the agriculture industry Friday and agreed to urge the federal government to provide financial aid to keep farmers afloat.
Commodity crop farmers are facing one of their worst periods in decades as a result of skyrocketing production costs and stagnant demand. Agriculture industry leaders told lawmakers last month in Stuttgart that 25% to 40% of farmers are likely to leave the industry after this season unless they receive aid.
Rep. DeAnn Vaught, R-Horatio, chairs the House Agriculture subcommittee that met in Stuttgart and has worked as a farmer herself. She said Friday during the Arkansas Legislative Council’s monthly meeting that there is “a tsunami coming” for Arkansas farmers.
“One out of every three farms shutting down in the state of Arkansas is going to affect that budget that’s sitting there in front of you,” she told Finance and Administration Secretary Jim Hudson. “And if we don’t start looking and forecasting out for that just in case the tsunami is coming, then we are failing the people of Arkansas.”
‘A dire strait’: 1 in 3 farms could close without aid, Arkansas agriculture leaders tell lawmakers

Federal lawmakers are responsible for renewing a sweeping agriculture bill every five years to set both policy and funding levels for the industry. Congress has repeatedly extended the 2018 farm bill a year at a time, but it expired Sept. 30 of this year, the day before the ongoing government shutdown began.
The shutdown is increasing farmers’ frustrations, said Senate Majority Leader Blake Johnson, a Corning Republican and longtime farmer. He told the council that “the whole U.S. agriculture sector” could go to Washington D.C. and “shut that place down” in their efforts to secure stability for the industry.
Johnson later clarified in an interview that he was not aware of concrete plans for farmers to go to D.C. and demand aid, but he emphasized that the agriculture industry needs help by the end of November.
“These guys, who are at the breaking point, have got to know something before the first of the year,” Johnson told the Advocate. “Those plans will be made for next year going into December, and they’ve got to know where they stand.”
Hudson told the Legislative Council that he is aware of “some liquidation of farming operations” and that Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has been petitioning the U.S. Department of Agriculture for farm aid.

“It’s incredibly unfortunate those farmers are hurting,” Hudson said. “I think this is a trade issue that needs to get resolved at a national and international level.”
He attributed some of the agriculture industry’s struggles to “predatory behavior by a foreign nation,” specifically China. Vaught said farmers’ primary problems are not China or tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump.
“Prices have been bad for three consecutive years,” she said in an interview. “We’ve had increases in our input and decreases in the amount of money that you’re receiving for your products. Because of that, it’s truly affecting the farmers and what they can borrow, how they can continue to farm, because [with] those inputs going up and getting less and less money, at some point bankers look at you and say, ‘I’m sorry, I can’t lend you any more money.’”
The council passed a resolution presented by Vaught and Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, to “respectfully urge President Donald J. Trump to implement targeted relief for Arkansas farmers in 2025.”
Resolutions are recommendations rather than policy, but Vaught said she is hopeful the resolution will help Sanders and Arkansas’ congressmen make a case for farm aid. Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman chairs the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, one of the committees responsible for drafting the farm bill.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-17 20:54:34+00:00,CT Mirror,"Child posed as dead New Britain girl in meeting, DCF says",Laura Tillman and Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/17/new-britain-girl-dcf-involvement/,DCF says the girl’s mother allegedly had another child impersonate the girl during a wellness check early this year.,"The Department of Children and Families says that the mother of a New Britain girl whose decomposing remains were found earlier this month had another child impersonate the girl during a wellness check with the child welfare agency early this year, months after the preteen is believed to have died. 
The remains of Jacqueline “Mimi” Torres-García were found on Oct. 8 in New Britain in a plastic container. Lamakers and advocates have demanded answers from DCF about the nature of the department’s involvement in the life of Torres-García and her family, and questioned how such a tragedy could have occurred. 
The case has also spurred renewed attention in the lack of monitoring of homeschooled children in the state, as details emerged that the girl’s parents appeared to have used homeschooling as a cover for Torres-García’s absence from school after her death.
On Friday, DCF provided some details of its role in Torres-García’s life. According to the department, it first became involved with the girl’s family when she was born. At the time, Torres-García’s mother, Karla García, was in a detention center so the baby was placed with a relative where she remained until May 2022, when she was 9 years old. That year, her parents sought guardianship of both Torres-García and her younger sibling, which was granted by the court, a decision supported by DCF at the time. 
“The Department’s recommendation was made after conducting a review of the family’s history and current circumstances, an interview with Jacqueline and her sibling and an assessment of the parents’ current ability to care for them at that time,” according to a statement provided by DCF. 
The department then interacted with the Torres-García “during a subsequent investigation” in September 2022 involving her younger siblings but there was not enough evidence to substantiate child abuse or neglect. DCF closed the case in November 2022. 
In the following two years, DCF says it had no involvement with the family, although it notes that Karla Garcia filed and was granted sole custody of Torres-García and a sibling in June 2024.
But in January of this year, allegations were again made against García, regarding the treatment of Torres-García’s younger sibling. As DCF checked on the sibling and then attempted to check on Torres-García, her mother told DCF employees that she was being homeschooled and had gone to visit a relative out of state. In response, “DCF conducted a video call with a person who (the) mother claimed to be Jacqueline.” But police have said they believe that Jacqueline had died months earlier. DCF, apparently satisfied with that call, closed the case in March 2025. 
The tragic death of Torres-García came to light at a moment when two of the state’s top child welfare positions are vacant — the commissioner of DCF, and the Office of the Child Advocate, a critical role for child welfare that has been vacant since Sarah Eagan resigned from the position in July of 2024. The child advocate is Connecticut’s critical mechanism for investigating state agencies such as DCF that handle the care of the state’s most vulnerable children. 
“This horrific situation should not have happened, and we are angry to hear that our state’s systems did not protect Jacqueline,” said Children’s Committee co-chairs Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton and Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford, in a Thursday statement. “As we learn more, it is becoming apparent that the Department of Children and Families failed her; DCF has one of the most important roles in our state and when it accepts less than 110%, our most vulnerable children are left in harm’s way, with children like Jacqueline suffering the consequences. 
“It’s clear that DCF did not meet the moment here, and we need answers as to how and why this happened, as well as assurances that we can make certain it never happens again.”
Police found the decomposed remains of Torres-García inside a plastic storage bin in New Britain on Oct. 8 after receiving a  phone tip about suspicious activity at an abandoned building. Police say they believe she may have been dead for as long as a year before her remains were discovered. Depending on when she was killed, she would have been either 11 or 12 years old. 
Police say the child’s mother and mother’s boyfriend had previously hidden her body in their basement before a family move. Both adults, along with the girl’s aunt, have been charged with felonies in relation to the murder. Those arrested had criminal histories, some of which dealt with the treatment of children, according to court records.
Karla Garcia was convicted of third-degree assault in 2018. The child’s aunt, Jackelyn Garcia, was convicted of risk of injury to a child in 2022. In 2020, Jonatan Nanita, the mother’s boyfriend, was convicted on a reckless endangerment charge, according to court records. 
Police say there is evidence Jacqueline suffered extensively before her death from malnutrition and physical abuse. 
New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart said during a Monday press conference that no one reported the girl missing, and that the family had a prior history with DCF. The agency confirmed that the girl’s siblings have since been taken into their custody. 
DCF’s interim Commissioner Susan Hamilton said the department is conducting a review of their history with the family.
“We have already begun a thorough review of our history with the family,” Hamilton said in a statement. “Consistent with our practice, this multidisciplinary review will include our knowledge about the family, supports provided, casework decisions, adherence to policy, as well as communication and collaboration with other system and community partners.”
Josh Michtom, a senior attorney at the Center for Children’s Advocacy, said that even at such a tragic moment, policymakers should remember that removing kids from their parents is, in many cases, harmful.
““Unfortunately I think a very, very good system, which we do not have, wouldn’t prevent every tragedy, but removing more children won’t prevent them either,” Michtom said. “We need well-supported offices, mental health care, and an oversight body and I don’t think we have any of those things right now.”
Information provided by DCF that shows the family appears to have effectively used the pretense of homeschooling to deceive caseworkers, has also put renewed pressure on the state to address a total lack of oversight for homeschooling. 
The case comes on the heels of the highly publicized case of a Waterbury man who was allegedly imprisoned for decades by his now-deceased father and stepmother after being pulled out of public school around the fifth grade.
An OCA report released in May found that lax homeschooling regulations have resulted in some Connecticut children not getting a proper education, while the opaque system has been used to cover up abuse.
In 2023, another child was found locked away and abused after he had been removed from school for homeschooling. And, in 2017, a Connecticut teenager died after prolonged abuse and neglect, and it was later discovered that his parents had pulled his sister out of school for homeschooling, according to the report.
Over the past three years in Connecticut, about 5,200 children have been withdrawn from public school to be homeschooled, state officials said Monday. This number doesn’t include students who have been homeschooled for their entire education.
Christina Ghio, who has been working as the acting child advocate for more than a year, said this week that her agency has begun a comprehensive investigation of the Torres-García case that will examine DCF’s involvement with the family and the role of about homeschooling in the case
Though too early to draw conclusions, Ghio wrote in a statement that, “On the issue of homeschooling, we know from previous investigations that some parents use Connecticut’s complete lack of oversight of homeschooled children to withdraw their children from school, isolate them, shield themselves from reports to our child welfare agency, and neglect or abuse their children. This is a known policy issue that the state must address.”
Rep. Liz Linehan, D-Cheshire, also expressed concern about the lack of regulation for homeschooled children. 
“It was my position then, and it is my position now, that the law allows for abusive parents to exploit loopholes and unenroll their children from public school under the guise of homeschooling to prevent a DCF referral from the school if a child is being abused.”
“The real questions have nothing whatsoever to do with homeschool,” said Diane Connors, the founder and co-president of CT Homeschool Network, asking why the child was left with relatives who had come to the state’s attention previously. “DCF failed yet again, those are the real issues that need to be addressed, not homeschooling.” 
Rep. Patrick Biggins, D-Manchester, convened a working group earlier this year to examine homeschool issues and regulations, but that group quickly disbanded. Biggins said he views this case as separate from homeschooling.
“I think that shouldn’t be because of this tragedy,” Biggins said of the law. “It should be because it’s the right thing to do. We shouldn’t be reactive in the laws that we implement.”
He said he doesn’t want to discuss a potential proposal to regulate homeschooling until more details are ironed out.
Rob Blanchard, a spokesman for Gov. Ned Lamont, said that the governor is open to conversation about homeschooling regulations.
“The governor continues to be supportive of ideas or approaches that keep kids safe,” Blanchard said Friday.
Children’s Committee ranking member Rep. Anne Dauphinais, R-Killingly, said state lawmakers and the community need answers about the case from DCF and about the school interactions.
“However, the rush by some to scapegoat homeschooling and formulate policy changes goes too far,” Dauphinais said in a statement. “We must have a full accounting of what transpired to ensure accountability and develop appropriate responses. To do otherwise would be a failure of our responsibility to learn the right lessons from this heartbreaking loss.”
Many lawmakers believe the problem lies with DCF, and say the agency must be transparent about what happened in this case.
“The system failed Mimi on multiple levels,” said a joint statement from Sen. Jason Perillo, R-Shelton and Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield. “We owe it to her to demand answers. Thorough investigations must be conducted.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jacqueline-22Mimi22-Torres-Garcia-Memorial-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-17 17:02:16.801020

“This is one of the most extraordinarily serious fraud schemes that I’ve seen in my years on the bench,” said the judge, who has presided over cases in federal court in Vermont since 1995.

BURLINGTON – A Florida man has been sentenced to serve a little more than three years in prison for his role in an international “grandparent scam” that defrauded older Americans, including those in Vermont, out of millions of dollars. 
The case provides an inside look at what prosecutors termed a highly sophisticated scheme that involved dozens of people posing in various and specific roles to carry it out, from fake bail bondsmen to phony attorneys. 
“This is one of the most extraordinarily serious fraud schemes that I’ve seen in my years on the bench,” federal Judge William K. Sessions III, said Thursday in ordering a 37-month prison term for Dave Leblanc during a hearing in U.S. District Court in Burlington. Sessions has served as a federal judge since 1995. 
Leblanc, 28, of Greenacres, Florida, had earlier pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Nathanael Burris, the prosecutor, said in court Thursday that Leblanc was the latest among roughly a half-dozen defendants who have been sentenced in connection with the scam. Several more people were facing pending charges or warrants for their arrests. 
Earlier this year, federal authorities in Vermont announced they had charged 25 Canadian nationals in connection with the “grandparent scam” that defrauded older Americans out of more than $21 million. 
Between the summer of 2021 and June 4, 2024, those charged engaged in a scam involving phone calls made from call centers in and around Montreal, according to charging documents.
The scam, according to federal authorities, defrauded individuals in Vermont and more than 40 other states. 
The defendants falsely claimed during phone calls to be an elderly victim’s relative, often a grandchild, who had been arrested and was in need of bail money, the documents stated. 
Leblanc, as well as others charged in the scam, would pose a “bail bondsman” or direct others to pick up packages of bulk cash at locations where the victims had mailed the money, court records stated.
“(Leblanc) and his immediate co-conspirators personally collected between $2,500,000 and $3,000,000 and participated in the laundering of this money to co-conspirators in the United States and Canada,” Burris wrote in a sentencing document filed ahead of Thursday’s hearing.
Burris called on the judge to sentence Leblanc to 10 years in prison, citing in large part the vulnerability of the elderly victims the scam preyed on, many of whom were in their 80s and 90s.
“Had Leblanc taken $3,000,000 from a bank vault, his conduct would be considered exceptionally serious, and there would be no question that just punishment would include a substantial sentence of incarceration,” Burris wrote. “The fact that he instead took the money from the hands of his elderly victims should be viewed as comparatively more serious.”
Burris called the organization of the scam “highly sophisticated,” with people even creating and maintaining payroll records for those involved.
The players involved, Burris added, also had distinct roles, from those staffing and managing the call centers to others responsible for collecting and laundering the money.  
After the initial caller contacted a grandparent, a second person posing as an “attorney” representing the family member in trouble would then tell the elderly victim in the scam to provide a “large sum of cash,” often thousands of dollars, to help bail out the family member from jail, Burris wrote. 
“The attorneys involved in this scam often identify themselves by various fictitious names, which sometimes are re-used in connection with calls to multiple elderly victims,” the prosecutor wrote. “The elderly victim is then instructed to provide the ‘bail money’ to a ‘bail bondsman’ who comes to the elderly victim’s home later the same day.”
Also, Burris wrote, the attorney tells the elderly victim that there is a “gag order” in effect that prohibits the victim from discussing the matter with anyone, adding that doing so could create more problems for the family member they are trying to help.
The call centers, sometimes called “boiler rooms,” can be located in places such as warehouses, office buildings, residences, condominiums or rental properties, Burris wrote.
“A manager may also be present in the call center and is usually responsible for logistics, such as making sure the telephones used by the call center are ready each day,” the prosecutor wrote. “The manager also controls the ‘leads’ — personal identifying information of elderly individuals in the United States purchased by the call centers for cents per lead.”
Michael Straub, Leblanc’s attorney, argued during Thursday’s hearing for a prison term of no more than 25 months for his client. 
He said Leblanc had no prior criminal record and was in his early 20s when he began his role in the scam and has since matured and become a valued member of his community. Straub said Leblanc’s role in the overall scheme was limited.
Leblanc also spoke, apologizing for his actions leading to the criminal case against him. He said he offered his “deepest condolences” to those who lost money in the scheme.
“I was young and immature at the time,” he told Sessions, adding, “I do feel terrible about this situation.” 
Vermont’s attorney general urges people who may be targeted by the scam to take the following precautions:

Resist the urge to act immediately.
Write down the phone number of the caller and hang up the phone.
If the caller references a family member, call that family member or another person who can verify their whereabouts and well-being.
Create an uncommon family codeword, phrase, or pin number that they agree to keep private to use during emergencies for verification.
Verify information the caller provides by reaching out to a trusted contact or the Consumer Assistance Program at 800-649-2424.

The Vermont Attorney General’s Office reports that “relationship imposter scams” — which include the “grandparent scam” — ranked fifth on its top 10 list of reported scams to the attorney general’s Consumer Assistance Program in 2024.

Free.,No Kings day expected to draw millions for anti-Trump mass protests,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/no-kings-day-expected-draw-millions-anti-trump-mass-protests,,"WASHINGTON — More than 2,600 nonviolent demonstrations against President Donald Trump’s administration are slated Saturday as part of No Kings day.The second No Kings day, following another in June, is in response to what a broad coalition of liberal advocacy and labor organizations say is “the increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration, which they have doubled down on since June.”  Organizers expect millions of Americans to join in peaceful events in Washington, D.C., across the country and internationally. Locations are pinpointed on a map on the organization’s website.“No Kings is back,” said Eunic Epstein-Ortiz, a national spokesperson, at a press conference Thursday. “And over the past few months, thousands of people have organized once again in their communities, on the ground locally, volunteering to bring their neighbors, families and friends together to say, unequivocally, we have no kings. Together, they’re the ones making this Saturday’s mobilization the largest single-day protest in modern history.”Among the states:In Utah, Salt Lake City’s No Kings protest organizers canceled the march portion of the event and are instead holding a longer demonstration at the state Capitol, according to the Utah News Dispatch.In Maine, at least 30 No Kings events are set to be held, per the Maine Morning Star.In Nevada, demonstrators in downtown Las Vegas will again be confined to sidewalks, the Nevada Current reports, citing high permit costs.In Kentucky, nearly 30 No Kings protests are popping up in the Bluegrass State, according to the Kentucky Lantern.Ten No Kings protests are planned in North Dakota, according to the North Dakota Monitor.In Arkansas, the Arkansas Advocate reports that the protests in more than a dozen cities come as the potential for severe weather ratchets up at the same time the events are scheduled.Shutdown, Trump crackdown since June protestsThe demonstrations build off the No Kings protests in June, which coincided with Trump’s massive military parade on his 79th birthday.Four months later, the federal government is mired in an ongoing shutdown that began Oct. 1 with no clear end in sight. The administration has also cracked down on U.S. cities, deploying National Guard troops and partaking in sweeping immigration raids. Leading voices from labor and advocacy groups that are part of the broad No Kings coalition amplified their message ahead of the planned protests during the Thursday press conference, underscoring a peaceful day of action on Saturday. “We’re going to vigorously exercise our democratic rights peacefully and nonviolently, and against this tyrannical threat of Donald Trump and his administration, we are going to protect American democracy,” said Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen.House speaker criticizes No Kings day National leaders from the coalition also pushed back against U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson’s depiction of the demonstrations as the “hate America rally.”

The Louisiana Republican claimed on Fox News Oct. 10 that “it’s all the pro-Hamas wing and the antifa people — they’re all coming out,” adding: “Some of the House Democrats are selling T-shirts for the event, and it’s being told to us that they won’t be able to reopen the government until after that rally because they can’t face their rabid base.”Leah Greenberg, co-founder of Indivisible, said “there is nothing more American than saying that we don’t have kings and exercising our right to peaceful protest,” adding: “America doesn’t have kings.

(Photo illustration by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)State contractor Deloitte has agreed to pay a proposed $6.3 million under a settlement to resolve claims related to last year’s RIBridges data breach filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
The proposed agreement, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, still needs final approval from a federal judge, but members of the class — a total of 735,501 people, according to court filings — could receive an estimated $100 with no documentation of identity theft needed.
But those checks could quickly shrink as the settlement fund needs to pay for attorneys’ costs and other legal fees. The more claims there are, the smaller the payouts will be.
A Deloitte spokesperson declined to comment when reached by email Friday. 
Settlement in the works to resolve RIBridges class action lawsuit

The settlement agreement notes that “Deloitte denies all liability and wrongdoing,” and the agreement shields the company from future litigation by people who do not send a request to opt out, whether or not they submit a claim. 
Tim Rondeau, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, said via email Friday that “The State is not a named party to this action and did not participate in this settlement.” But the deal does shield the state — by declaring it a “released party” — and its agencies from any related lawsuits by class members who don’t opt out of compensation. 
“The State had a contract with Deloitte for IT and computer processing of the state programs such as food stamps,” Peter Wasylyk, part of the plaintiffs’ legal team, said.
The case was originally filed last December, after the breach was first made public, by Wasylyk on behalf of food stamps and other public benefit recipients whose personal data was impacted. RIBridges is the unified platform made and still currently run by Deloitte which helps residents access public benefits and the state’s health insurance marketplace. The data plundered by cybercrime outfit Brain Cipher in the breach included information used to apply for these services. 
The case was eventually consolidated with several other named plaintiffs into the current class action suit.
While the state is not named as a defendant in the suit, its inclusion as a party released from future litigation is not unusual in a large class action lawsuit. In law, the concept of “global peace” often extends future legal protections to entities beyond the ones being specifically sued.
Meanwhile, both parties are still waiting for updates, and Wasylyk said the court is still reviewing the settlement agreement. The agreement will need a preliminary approval and a final approval. Claims will be due before the judge issues final approval. 
An approximate timeline in the agreement would see the final approval hearing take place “at least 100 days after the motion for preliminary approval” is filed, meaning sometime in Jan. 2026, but that schedule could change with the availability of U.S. District Judge Melissa R. Dubose, who is assigned to the case.
Claims will eventually be open for submission on a website and toll-free line run by Kroll, a firm noted for its settlement administration services. After a judge’s preliminary approval, Kroll will also send out postcard notices to eligible class members, with information on how to submit claims by mail. Those postcards will go out within 30 days of the judge’s preliminary approval. 
Anyone who received an RIBridges breach notice earlier this year is likely eligible to stake a claim. Class members can opt out of the settlement benefits if they so choose. Otherwise, they remain eligible for one of the following:

Reimbursement up to $5,000 with third-party documentation like phone records, receipts, emails, and so on, that show evidence of harm or identity theft from the breach. 
An estimated $100 reimbursement, no documentation needed.

Kroll will also handle opt-out requests, which requires class members to “send a request…or written notice” asking to be excluded from settlement. The deadline to opt out or submit objections is 30 days before the final approval hearing. Class members who do not submit or opt out will not receive any compensation, and they will also lose their ability for future litigation.
The settlement also provides all class members, regardless of which reimbursement they choose, the option to sign up for two years of medical data monitoring from CyEx.
Wasylyk said Friday that the $100 is the baseline both parties agreed to, and that class members could see more money if there aren’t enough claimants to “exhaust” the full $6.3 million.
“In that case a pro-rata increase to more than $100 would go to class members,” Wasylyk explained. 
But the settlement agreement details that these payouts are subject to “pro rata increase or decrease,” meaning they go up or down depending on the final number of claims. The total $6.3 million windfall also includes attorneys’ fees and other litigation costs, as well as the expense of the CyEx medical monitoring.
A draft of the claim submission form clearly delineates the money that could be deducted from the total: “up to one-third of the $6,300,000 Settlement Fund ($2,100,000), plus reimbursement of costs” for the class’ legal team, plus “Service Awards in the amount of $2,500 to each Class Representative,” which are the named plaintiffs in the class suit.
After people choose how to be paid, any residual funds would go toward the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a digital-privacy nonprofit based in Washington, D.C, after 240 days.

Our population is booming, our industries are expanding, and new investments are flowing into communities across the state. As we welcome these opportunities, it’s important to remember that the very qualities that make our state competitive — our landscapes, waterways and quality of life — must be safeguarded.
Economic growth and conservation must go hand in hand if we want progress that is resilient, responsible and sustainable.
That’s where Sustain South Carolina comes in.
As the CEO of Sustain SC, I lead a business-driven organization focused on forging practical, market-based solutions that enhance South Carolina’s competitiveness. We
unite industry leaders, government entities and local stakeholders to strengthen the private sector while preserving the natural resources and agrarian culture that drive our way of life in South Carolina.
To give structure to that vision, we created the “Roadmap to Sustain SC.”
The roadmap outlines high-impact strategies — attracting new industries, modernizing production, fostering a circular economy and boosting resilience against flooding and water scarcity.
These are not abstract ideas — they are economic levers.
Consider this: over the past two years, energy-storage companies have announced nearly $8 billion in capital investment in South Carolina.
That commitment underscores how battery technology and energy resilience are already driving job growth, strengthening the grid and positioning South Carolina as a rising leader in the clean-energy economy.
This October, these conversations will take center stage at our fourth annual Sustainability Symposium, the state’s premier event for business and community leaders working at the intersection of commerce and conservation.
The symposium will highlight South Carolina’s defining challenges and opportunities — from strengthening resiliency through land and water conservation to advancing economic development through clean energy and innovation.
We are proud to welcome James Dozier, founder and board president of Centerline Action, as our keynote speaker.
For nearly 20 years, James has been at the nexus of federal and state advocacy, political strategy and grassroots campaigns. He brings a unique background in Republican politics and business advocacy, offering perspectives that frame South Carolina’s opportunity to lead nationally by pairing economic growth with conservation.

The symposium isn’t just about ideas – it’s about action.
Sustain SC has already delivered results through our Land and Water Action Platform, where corporate investments have helped to conserve critical watersheds and preserved natural landscapes like Waites Island.
This year’s symposium builds on that model of success, showcasing how partnerships between business leaders, conservationists, and policymakers can deliver results that strengthen communities and drive prosperity.
South Carolinians support this vision.
We regularly poll voters to stay grounded in what matters most, and our recent statewide survey of 1,200 likely Republican primary voters — conducted with The Nature Conservancy — revealed compelling support for linking conservation and economic growth:

83% said conserving land and water is essential for both growth and environmental protection.
81% support land conservation to preserve natural and historic resources.
82% believe water management must balance economic use with recreation.
73% favor resilience investments that leverage state dollars to secure federal and private funding for flood prevention and mitigation.
72.9% of respondents support South Carolina adding and using more renewable energy resources such as new nuclear, hydrogen, biomass, solar and wind.

These numbers confirm what we see on the ground every day: economic and environmental resilience are two sides of the same coin.
Our mission is not to saddle businesses with mandates, but to create smart opportunities for investment, efficiency and resilience that benefit both the bottom line and quality of life.
If you care about private-sector growth, job creation, small business opportunities and smart investments in our future, we invite you to join us at our fourth annual Sustainability Symposium on Thursday, Oct. 23, and be part of shaping what comes next.

Karen Lueders, a Democrat from Lincoln and a lawyer who has served on several nonprofit boards in Addison County, will fill the vacant House seat left by Democrat Mari Cordes. 
Gov. Phil Scott announced Lueders’ appointment in a press release on Friday. 
“With many years of public service, I believe she will be an effective legislator and represent her constituents well,” Scott said in the release.
The district, composed of Lincoln, Bristol, Starksboro, and Monkton, was previously represented by Cordes, who resigned her seat earlier this year, spurred by personal and political factors to move to Canada. 
At the time, Cordes told VTDigger she had feared for her safety since President Donald Trump’s first presidential term. A member of the LGBTQ+ community, she said that in her past six years as a representative, she had received two death threats. 
The governor has authority to appoint replacements to fill legislative vacancies and traditionally selects a replacement from the same party as the outgoing representative.
Lueders serves on the board of Addison Housing Works, an affordable housing nonprofit in the county, and previously served on the boards of Addison County Home Health and Hospice as well as Habitat for Humanity, according to the release. She is slated to serve the rest of Cordes’ two-year term. 
Lueders did not immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment Friday afternoon.
“I am grateful to the Governor for the opportunity to represent Addison-4 in the Vermont House of Representatives,” she said in the release. “I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House to find solutions for the complex concerns that affect our communities across the state.”
Lueders’ son, Tim Lueders-Dumont, is executive director of the Vermont Department of State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs.

(Courtesy Duke Rodriguez)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham crossed out several provisions in a $162 million spending package state lawmakers approved during a special session earlier this month, an act that a prominent cannabis CEO contends in a new lawsuit is unconstitutional. 
Duke Rodriguez, the CEO of Ultra Health Cannabis who is publicly weighing a run for governor as a Republican, filed a lawsuit Thursday asking the New Mexico Supreme Court to undo the governor’s vetoes.
He argued that the governor striking language from House Bill 1, a spending bill lawmakers approved in early October to counteract federal funding cuts, disrupts the balance of power between the Legislature and the executive branch. 
In the Running: Who’s in, who’s out for the 2026 NM governor race

Each of the line-item vetoes “distorts legislative intent and is therefore an unconstitutional attempt by the Executive to substitute her policy-making judgment for that of the people’s elected representatives,” the lawsuit alleges.
The bill awarded $12 million to the state Health Care Authority “to maintain the minimum federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefit for elders and people with disabilities.” But the governor struck the words “minimum federal.”  
Rodriguez’s lawsuit argues that removing that language illegally allows the executive branch to expand SNAP benefits beyond the minimum federal requirements, which was not the state Legislature’s intent. 
“The Governor may attempt to use funds appropriated by the Legislature to provide SNAP benefits that exceed the federal minimum, or to provide SNAP benefits to an expanded class of beneficiaries, in direct contravention of legislative intent,” Rodriguez writes in the lawsuit.
The governor also struck language regarding about $6 million aimed at replenishing funding local public broadcasters lost when Congress cut funding to the Center for Public Broadcasting. She removed requirements that the unexpended funding to the state finance and Indian Affairs departments be returned to the general fund, and she removed language requiring the funding to be spent within the next two fiscal years. 
Michael Coleman, the governor’s communications director,, told Source New Mexico on Friday afternoon that Rodriguez’s attempt to speak on behalf of the Legislature’s behalf is “preposterous.”
“Mr. Rodriguez was not present for discussions with lawmakers about the budget, but he appears to be claiming knowledge of the ‘legislative intent’ of these appropriations,” he said, before noting that the Legislature passed the appropriations with broad bipartisan support. “With this lawsuit, Mr. Rodriguez is advocating to take food off the tables of New Mexican families that need it most.”
Wage boost for chile workers hangs in the balance, though some say the state could make it happen

In an Oct. 3 statement Lujan Grisham published detailing the vetoes, she said they were “minor” but necessary changes to counteract “provisions that unduly constrain the Executive Department’s ability to assist New Mexicans.”
Rodriguez is seeking the court’s immediate intervention to determine the constitutional limits of the governor’s line-item veto power. He argues that he has standing to bring the lawsuit as a private citizen because the “separation of powers is an issue of substantial public importance.”
Jacob Candelaria, a former state senator, is representing Rodriguez in court. Candelaria was a Democrat until his last year in office 2022, when he changed his party designation to “Decline to state.” 
He successfully sued Lujan Grisham in 2021 over a similar allegation of the governor usurping the Legislature’s spending power. He argued that lawmakers, not the governor, should be in charge of distributing hundreds of millions of dollars in federal pandemic funding.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Courtsey-Duke-Rodriguez-720x1024.jpg,,,2025-10-17 17:02:16.801020

[…]","South Central Judicial District Judge Jackson Lofgren presides over a trial Jan. 27, 2025, in Bismarck. (Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Testimony from kids and parents affected by North Dakota’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors wasn’t central to a judge’s decision last week to uphold the statute.
Instead, the ruling hinged on defining who deserves special legal protections and whether the law discriminates on the basis of sex, according to one state constitutional law expert.
The plaintiffs argued that transgender adolescents affected by the bill should be considered a protected class under the law because they are a small minority being forced to conform with government-imposed sex stereotypes.
Quinn Yeargain, an associate professor of law at Michigan State University, agreed, citing the history of discrimination against transgender people in areas like employment, health care and a host of other areas.
“It’s very difficult for me to conclude that transgender status, gender identity, however we want to label it, is not a protected class,” Yeargain said. “There’s every reason to believe that it is.”
Transgender teen urges judge to legalize gender-affirming care for minors in North Dakota

Had South Central Judicial District Judge Jackson Lofgren agreed, the state may have had to work harder to prove the law is constitutional, Yeargain said. But Lofgren felt differently.
As he notes in his opinion, special legal status is typically granted to groups that are politically powerless and have repeatedly faced legal oppression. Courts have also found that an important characteristic of these protected classes is that they’re based on innate, unchangeable qualities — like race and ethnicity.
He rejected the notion that transgender people are politically powerless, pointing to the fact that many people testified in opposition to the health care ban and that other state legislatures and courts have acted in ways that bolster transgender rights. He also wrote that he didn’t see convincing evidence that the Legislature adopted the law out of animus toward transgender people, or that the authors of North Dakota’s constitution were aware of or supportive of transgender people.
Furthermore, Lofgren said he does not consider being transgender an immutable characteristic because people’s gender identities can change over time.
Lofgren also dismissed another of the plaintiffs’ key arguments: that the health care law discriminates based on transgender status.
The plaintiffs argued the law is a form of sex discrimination because it bars minors with gender dysphoria from accessing medical treatments that are otherwise available to kids to treat other medical conditions.
Lofgren concluded the law discriminates only based on age and the purpose of the medical treatment in question.
The U.S. Supreme Court in June came to a similar conclusion in its decision upholding a ban on gender affirming care for minors in Tennessee, which Lofgren cited frequently in his opinion.
North Dakota’s ban on transgender care for minors life-threatening, doctor testifies

The plaintiffs also said the North Dakota law infringes on North Dakotans’ rights to autonomy and self-determination, though Lofgren found that these rights do not bar the state from prohibiting certain medical procedures.
The lawsuit was brought against the state of North Dakota in 2023 by three families with transgender children and a pediatric endocrinologist. Lofgren later dismissed the families and children from the suit, finding they did not have standing to bring it. That left pediatric endocrinologist Luis Casas as the sole plaintiff.
Attorneys for the state of North Dakota argued that the law is constitutional because the state has an interest in regulating the medical profession and protecting minors.
Two transgender adolescents and their parents testified against the ban at a seven-day court trial earlier this year. They described gender-affirming care as life-saving, and said the health care law had forced them to seek treatment out of state.
Their testimony wasn’t discussed in Lofgren’s 85-page order.
Yeargain said this wasn’t surprising, given how Lofgren structured his analysis of the case.
“If the framework of this is there is no historical support for this, and transgender status is not a protected class, and this is not discrimination based on sex and so on, then a lot of those stories are not legally relevant,” Yeargain said.
Absent a finding that the law affects a protected group or restricts an important right, judges evaluate laws in a way that is “highly deferential” to lawmakers, said James Blumstein, a law professor at Vanderbilt University.
That means state legislatures generally have broad latitude to pass laws like the transgender health care ban. Under this framework, courts will let any law stand so long as that law conceivably furthers a legitimate government interest, Blumstein said.
It doesn’t have to be the most logical or effective policy, it just needs to be plausible that the law helps achieve the legislators’ goal, he added.
“The way I like to say it is, you can burn down the barn to kill the rat,” Blumstein said.
In order to have proven the law unconstitutional, the plaintiffs would have had to present overwhelming evidence that withholding gender-affirming care from transgender kids is harmful, said Blumstein.
Judge rules in favor of North Dakota’s ban on transgender care for minors

Jess Braverman, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said this is exactly what they did.
“The evidence at trial clearly showed how hard this ban has hit North Dakota families and transgender adolescents,” Braverman told the North Dakota Monitor last week. “It’s just really disappointing that these families won’t be able to get the health care they need.”
One parent who was formerly a plaintiff in the suit said in a statement through an attorney their family is “heartbroken and angry” about the decision.
“I am proud to stand up for the rights of my family, my child, and all transgender youth and their families in North Dakota who are impacted by this harmful law,” said the parent, who was
anonymous in the lawsuit.
North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley in a statement last week applauded Lofgren’s ruling.
“The district court’s thorough and thoughtful decision makes clear that our elected legislative body appropriately reached this medical health determination and passed legislation that is constitutionally sound,” Wrigley said.
Legal advocacy group Gender Justice, which is representing the plaintiffs, said Friday they had not yet made a decision about whether to appeal.
The evidence
Attorneys for the plaintiffs repeatedly pointed out that mainstream medical associations in America endorse puberty blockers and hormone therapy as a safe and effective way to treat gender dysphoria.
Their witnesses — which included two transgender adolescents and parents, two pediatric endocrinologists, a psychiatrist and psychologist that have treat adolescents with gender dysphoria and other medical experts — said gender-affirming care can be life-saving.
The state’s expert witnesses included two endocrinologists, a psychologist and a psychiatrist. Only one of the state’s witnesses had experience diagnosing people with gender dysphoria.
They testified that there is no robust long-term research exploring the effects of puberty blockers and hormone therapy on minors with gender dysphoria, so minors and their families cannot meaningfully be informed of the benefits or risks of the treatment.
The plaintiffs’ witnesses did not dispute the lack of research, but noted it is difficult to conduct top-tier studies like randomized control trials on children because it’s unethical and expensive. They said that the existing data on gender-affirming care demonstrates it works. They also argued that many mainstream medications have been accepted as safe for use on children without this level of clinical research.
Advocates against gender-affirming care for minors testify in North Dakota trial

Some witnesses for the state also have had the credibility of their testimony disputed in other lawsuits.
The state’s witnesses did not deny that their views were considered fringe in the United States. However, they argued that leading medical associations only endorse gender-affirming care as safe for minors for political reasons.
It was up to the judge to decide whether the evidence indicated the Legislature had a rational basis for passing the health care ban.
Yeargain said that ordinarily in cases like this, judges will defer to lawmakers and are “not involved in the enterprise of really weighing evidence.”
“I don’t necessarily think just as a flat matter that whatever any medical association says automatically should determine the scope of legislation,” Yeargain noted. “On the other hand, I think there’s something to be said when virtually all of the major medical associations that have expertise in these areas and are qualified to opine on them pretty much articulate the same thing.”
Blumstein said he does not consider it concerning that North Dakota lawmakers adopted a policy that goes against the medical establishment.
He said the United States is in a period of transferring political power from institutional experts to elected officials.
“There was a realization that experts are not politically accountable, and having politics in the decision is not a bad thing, it builds accountability,” he said.

Jerry Moran of Kansas advocates for delivery of cruise missiles to Ukraine and more intense economic sanctions on Russia.,"U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, endorses during a Senate speech on Oct. 16, 2025, intensification of economic pressure on Russia and deployment of cruise missiles to Ukraine in an effort to end the war started by Russia in 2022. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of the U.S. Senate's YouTube channel) TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran reaffirmed Friday a belief that United States’ interests require delivery of long-range missiles to Ukraine and application of intense economic pressure on Russia to end its unjustified military invasion launched in 2022.
Moran, who has represented Kansas in Congress for more than a quarter century, said in a speech Thursday to Senate colleagues the war between Ukraine and Russia was a threat to stability of the United States.
The Republican senator said there was merit to transferring American-made Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. Making the cruise missiles available to Ukraine would bring high-impact armaments within range of Moscow.
“This weaponry will strengthen Ukraine’s ability to defend its territory, deter further Russian aggression and help level the battlefield as negotiations hopefully move forward,” Moran said. “By providing advanced, precision-strike systems, America demonstrates that our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty is backed not only by words, but by legitimate support that can alter the course of this war.”
His remarks came after President Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and before Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
“As the conflict in Ukraine has surpassed the three-year mark, Putin remains undeterred in his mission to carry out his unjust war on the Ukrainian people,” the senator said. “Each day this war continues, lives are lost and the safety, economic stability and global leadership of the United States are threatened. This war must end.”
He commended the Trump administration for considering transfer of the missiles to Ukraine and for promoting conversations between Russia and Ukraine on finding a “durable and just peace.”
Bipartisan legislation pending in Congress should be adopted to intensify sanctions against Russia’s economy and trade, Moran said.
“By cutting off the resources that allow Putin to fund this war, we can hasten the path to success in finding peace,” he said. “It is imperative that the United States stands firm in its support for Ukraine and, in doing so, places significant pressure on Putin to show our adversaries that democracy will not go undefended.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jerry-Moran-on-Ukraine-missiles-1024x578.png,,,2025-10-17 17:02:16.801020

The board unanimously approved the request by Steve Cunningham, chair of the Jackson State search committee, to begin gathering a proposed list of potential members to serve on a Search Advisory Constituency. 
The advisory group will support the board’s search committee by providing recommendations and insights during the process. 
Cunningham and IHL Commissioner Al Rankins must submit a list of names for review and approval at a future meeting, possibly before IHL’s next board meeting on Nov. 20. 
“This is the first time our board has done this in a long time,” said Gee Ogletree, president of the IHL board. “It’s because we have heard from many people asking us to broaden this process and we’re listening, and you’ve seen the board act.” 
The move marks the first time in recent years the board has used an advisory group to assist with Jackson State’s presidential searches. The last time the board used a group was in 2017 during the university’s executive search that resulted in William Bynum. In 2022, the board’s policies were revised to provide for a Search Advisory Constituency.
Alumni and supporters of the HBCU have repeatedly raised questions about the board’s opaque process, calling for a fair, transparent national leadership search for the university. This includes having multiple supporters’ voices heard and valued. 
The top job at Jackson State has been vacant since May. Marcus Thompson resigned as president less than two years into his tenure without explanation from the IHL board. 
Thompson was the third president to depart in five years — similar to his two predecessors, Thomas Hudson and Bynum. 
Denise Jones-Gregory is serving as the interim president. 
The IHL board can seek additional input from constituents and stakeholders by appointing members to serve on an advisory group for a university’s presidential search, according to board policies. 
The group can have up to 15 members and should represent a diverse range of university stakeholders, such as students, faculty, staff, alumni and community members. The advisory group will not discuss potential candidates, since the process only seeks to gather input. Nor will the board publicly share the group’s input, as stated in board policies. 
The board also heard Thursday from Kim Bobby and Carlton Brown, two consultants with ABG Search, an executive headhunting firm based in Washington. The consultants presented a proposed timeline for Jackson State’s president search as well as best practices. 
In September, the board voted to select ABG Search, to assist with naming the university’s next leader, departing from its usual pick of Academic Search, an executive firm it has used twice in the past. 
It is unclear when the board will announce constituency group members or how long the presidential search will take, but AGB’s proposed timeline said it could be up to five months. The board said it is committed to getting it right. 
“This work will take time and due diligence, and is not locked into a specific timeframe,” John Sewell, director of communications for the IHL board, said in a statement.  
Cunningham, who is also a Jackson State alum, said the board is working to find the best possible candidate. 
“We all know the university has a rich history and bright future,” Cunningham said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/06121027/JSU-Listening-Session1.jpg,,,2025-10-17 17:02:16.801020
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-17 19:57:14+00:00,CT Mirror,Kosta Diamantis defends his acceptance of money from contractors,Andrew Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/17/kosta-diamantis-trial-contractors-money/,Diamantis argued it was completely legal for him to accept tens of thousands of dollars in ‘fees’ from two school construction contractors.,"Konstantinos “Kosta” Diamantis, the former head of Connecticut’s school construction program, argued on Thursday and Friday that it was completely legal for him to accept tens of thousands of dollars in “fees” from a pair of school construction contractors.
But if that is true, prosecutors asked during a contentious cross-examination Friday, why did Diamantis try to keep the money he was accepting from Acranom Masonry and Construction Advocacy Professionals so secret?
During the eighth day of Diamantis’ ongoing federal corruption trial, prosecutors challenged Diamantis on a number of issues, including why he never reported the income he earned from those two companies on his federal tax returns or in his ethics filings with the state of Connecticut.
Diamantis told prosecutors that he didn’t have a “business relationship” with either company and thus didn’t need to report on his state ethics filings. And as for his tax returns, he told the jury that he would be amending his previous filings to account for the additional money he made between 2018 and 2021.
Diamantis’ time on the stand on Friday was far different from his experience testifying on Thursday, when his attorney Norm Pattis asked him questions about how he sought to save taxpayers money.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Francis, who is leading the case against Diamantis, attempted to pick apart portions of his previous testimony.
With Diamantis willingly admitting that he received money from the two school construction companies, Francis focused on proving that Diamantis helped those two contractors on school construction projects or threatened to cut them out of projects if they didn’t pay up.
Francis was aided in that effort by the overwhelming amount of text messages, financial records and other hard evidence that prosecutors filed in the case.
The prosecutor pressed Diamantis over several hours to explain text messages and emails in which he directly intervened in the Weaver High School project in Hartford on behalf of Acranom. And he grilled Diamantis about one conversation in which he threatened to “find a new mason” on the Birch Grove project in Tolland if Acranom didn’t make payments to him.
“I will wait til Monday for him to give me 40. Or I think Tolland needs a new mason,” the text said.
“He has no idea who I am and my back to the wall,” Diamantis wrote in another message.
Under pressure from Francis, Diamantis agreed that he told Acranom’s leader that he would pull the company from the project.
But he suggested it was a hollow threat because he really didn’t have the power to hire or fire companies on school projects in Connecticut.
Throughout his two days of testimony, Diamantis maintained that he never used his public office for personal gain.
The checks he received from Construction Advocacy Professionals, Diamantis said, were for legal work he performed for the company.
And the cash he received from Acranom, he said, was payment for him to broker a relationship between Acranom and D’Amato construction, one of the largest construction firms in Connecticut.
That defense was challenged after Diamantis left the stand, however.
Pattis called Edward D’Amato Jr. to the stand, as one of Diamantis’ defense witnesses, but D’Amato repeatedly told the jury that Diamantis never brokered a meeting between his company and Acranom. 
“I don’t recall a conversation like that, no,” D’Amato said.
But even before D’Amato testified, prosecutors had placed Diamantis on the defensive as they confronted him with his own text messages.
Francis ran Diamantis through a host of messages in which he discussed Acranom’s school construction contracts in Hartford and Tolland and, in the next breath, reminded the company’s executives of the money they owed him.
In one text message, Diamantis wrote: “I need 5 k desperately tomorrow from him, or anyone. I don’t care who;. I shouldn’t have to beg. He owes me 77 2 months ago.”
When asked about that message, Diamantis said he was referencing $77 that Sal Monarca, the owner of Acranom, owed him for a lunch. 
Prosecutors also asked about a text exchange in which Diamantis instructed John Duffy, the vice president of Acranom, for money and then told him to “erase” their communications.
Diamantis was adamant, however, that he didn’t tell Duffy to delete the conversation because they were discussing his compensation.
“That’s not the context,” Diamantis said.
Throughout his hours of testimony, Diamantis and Francis verbally sparred. Francis tried to pin the defendant down to yes and no answers. And Diamantis sought to dodge some of the questions Francis posed.
The back-and-forth between the two men became so heated that, during a break, Pattis asked for a mistrial because of how Francis was handling the cross examination. He said the prosecutor was being too “theatrical” in his response to Diamantis’ answers.
U.S. District Judge Stefan Underhill denied that request to end the trial, but he asked Francis and Diamantis to “take the temperature down a notch.” And he warned that he didn’t want a “street fight” in his courtroom.
New evidence
As Diamantis’ time on the stand neared its end, prosecutors also dropped brand new evidence into the trial: text messages between Diamantis and his daughter, Anastasia.
Francis unveiled that evidence to the jury as he pressed Diamantis about whether he ever helped negotiate what Construction Advocacy Professionals paid his daughter as an administrative assistant.
Diamantis told the jury on Thursday that he had no role in negotiating what Antonietta DiBenedetto Roy, the owner of CAP, paid his daughter.
But the texts that Francis revealed showed Diamantis had multiple conversations with his daughter about what Roy would pay her. One of the exchanges suggested that compensation would be linked to how much CAP would make from a contract on the Birch Grove Elementary project in Tolland.
“I told (Roy) I expect you get percentage bonus,” Diamantis told his daughter. “I’m told don’t worry. I got Anastasia.”
At another point, Diamantis asked his daughter if she was satisfied after he “negotiated” another $1,500 for her.
“You happy,” he asked.
“Yes of course! I can pay my car taxes and a credit card!” his daughter responded.
“Great and more to come,” Diamantis said.
Diamantis said he couldn’t recall negotiating any compensation with CAP for his daughter.
Some of the other comments in the text messages, Diamantis added, were a “tongue in cheek” remark.
In 2024, Roy pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe Diamantis on school construction projects.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1016_SR_KostaTrial_056-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-17 15:57:44.706869

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)President Donald Trump spoke with Indiana Senate Republicans on a Friday morning phone call in the latest effort to pressure Hoosier GOP legislators to redistrict the state congressional map early.
The call was first reported by The New York Times Friday afternoon.
Molly Swigart, communications director for the Indiana Senate Republicans, confirmed that caucus members were invited to join a call with the president and that Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray participated. She would not say how many other lawmakers joined the call.
A few hours later, Sen. Tyler Johnson, R-Leo, posted a statement in support of redistricting. He also attended a meeting at the White House in August on redistricting and other topics.
He blamed the national political landscape for bringing “a fight to our doorstep that we did not ask for and Hoosiers rightfully scoff at but we must use every legal means at our disposal to counter this with a redistricting effort.”

All states drew new maps in 2021 after the decennial census. Indiana’s breakdown is 7-2 in favor of Republicans. But advocates for redistricting want to eliminate the Democrat districts in Indianapolis and northwest Indiana.
Texas was the first state to pass new maps in August at the behest of the Trump administration, which is trying to ensure it retains controls of the U.S. House in 2026. Missouri then followed in September.
Democrat-led California responded by putting a question on its November ballot to do the same. Other Democrat states could follow. GOP states Nebraska, Kansas and North Carolina are also being targeted for new maps.
“Indiana is a red state through and through, and our congressional districts should mirror that sentiment,” Johnson said. “For too long, maps have diluted the voices of everyday Hoosiers who prioritize fiscal responsibility, strong borders, and traditional values. By redistricting we can improve the likelihood that Indiana’s delegation in Washington fights unequivocally for Hoosier interests-lowering taxes, protecting life, and standing up to federal overreach.”
He said a unified delegation can ensure health care access, economic growth and energy independence.
Indiana’s Senate Republican caucus has been more hesitant than House Republicans and where much of the new pressure has been focused. Vice President JD Vance visited Indiana last week initially to speak to the Senate caucus but added a meeting with House members. It was Vance’s second visit about the topic since August.
The Indiana Capital Chronicle has been tracking public statements on the proposal — four Senate Republicans have come out in support while three are against. The rest of the 40-member caucus is undecided or haven’t been definitive in their statements.

Tony Evers at a 2023 DWD event held at the Plumbers Local 75 training center in Madison. Pechacek held a news conference online Thursday where she spoke about the impact of the federal government shutdown on DWD and the state. (Photo courtesy of DWD)As the federal shutdown drags on, Wisconsin is likely to feel the impact — in employment, in agriculture and in the safety net for workers, according to the state’s labor secretary.
“Right now, we have the ability to continue to operate and our goal is to not disrupt our current workforce programs or state workforce,” said Amy Pechacek, secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, during an online news conference Thursday.
Governments in some other states have started to reduce their workforces, Pechacek said. Wisconsin is holding off on filling vacancies and taking other steps “to try and preserve all of the funding we can so that we don’t have programmatic or employment disruptions,” Pechacek said.
Nevertheless, 75% of the DWD’s $500 million annual budget — three out of every four dollars — comes from the federal government, she said.
The remaining 25% that comes from the state isn’t “just one big pot,” Pechacek added, but funds specific programs. For example, the state workers compensation program, which covers treatment costs and lost income for people injured on the job, is entirely state funded. That includes the cost of administering the program.
But job support services — local job centers, career counseling, unemployment insurance administration, state apprenticeship programs, and the division of vocational rehabilitation for people with disabilities — are “all tied to federally funded programs,” Pechacek said.
“We need the federal government to come together, come up with a funding mechanism and continue to support their obligations to all the states and to all the people to ensure that we can move forward with the economic health and prosperity that we have enjoyed without this chaotic massive interruption,” she said. “The longer this goes, the continued adverse and exponentially worse impacts to our workforce will compound.”
Pechacek’s virtual news conference Thursday took the place of DWD’s monthly report on Wisconsin employment data. The usual reports draw on the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys that poll employers on the number of jobs they have and poll households to calculate the unemployment rate.
The data BLS compiles and analyzes is one of the casualties of the shutdown, Pechacek said, hampering employers, job seekers, nonprofits, economic development agencies and governments.
All of them rely on BLS data “to guide fiscal decision making, determine whether to open or expand their businesses, determine if they’re going to hire or lay off, figure out how to allocate resources, and understand really how best to train their current workforce,” Pechacek said. Without that information, “employers are putting off important decisions, essentially fumbling around in the dark until Congress can get around to turning back the lights on.”
Unemployment claims can serve as one indicator, and Scott Hodek, section chief in the DWD Office of Economic Advisors, said the department is looking at other data sources to fill in some of the missing information. Those sources include various private sector organizations as well as the regional federal reserve banks.
“But really it’s pretty difficult to get an accurate picture of what’s happening,” Hodek said. “It will get more difficult as time goes on.”
Another federal report on inflation is expected to be released soon, even with the shutdown, because the findings are used to calculate annual cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients, Hodek said.
That report will also figure into the deliberations of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee when it meets at the end of October to decide whether to cut interest rates. The Fed’s dual mission includes keeping inflation as close to 2% as possible while encouraging maximum employment.
“That becomes very difficult to do if you don’t have any of that data to make those decisions,” Hodek said.
Looking at the coming months, Pechacek said, the process of applying for H-2A agriculture visas is on hold. The visas enable about 3,000 migrant workers to come in annually to work in specific seasonal agricultural operations, including planting, harvesting and food processing, she said.
DWD is required to verify that there is a worker shortage in the occupations to be covered, and the U.S. Department of Labor must certify the state’s verification report before the federal government issues the visas, she said, but the federal certification of the state’s report is on hold because of the shutdown.
December and January are the months when the most requests come in for H-2A visas, Pechacek said, so if the shutdown continues for too long, the agricultural employers depending on those workers would be unable to get the needed certification.
Pechacek said the department is also watching to see how many federal employees file for unemployment insurance.
There are about 18,000 federal employees in Wisconsin, and DWD has estimated that 8,000 might be affected by the shutdown. By comparison, she said, one of the largest layoffs in Wisconsin took place in 2018 when a larger retailer shut down, laying off 2,200 employees.
So far, however, there have been just 30 initial claims from federal workers, Pechacek said.
If federal workers who file unemployment claims get back pay when they return to work, however, they’ll have to repay the unemployment insurance fund.
Pechacek noted that President Donald Trump has threatened to permanently fire federal workers in the shutdown as well as to withhold back pay for furloughed federal workers who return to work. Between uncertainty about those threats and court rulings that have blocked some mass federal layoffs, however, “it is really an ongoing situation,” she added.
Pechacek several times criticized Trump and the Republican leaders in Congress for the shutdown.
“The president and congressional Republicans have shut down our nation’s government trying to force massive health care cuts and cost increases to the nation’s working and middle class families and we are in a stalemate,” she said.
“We really need our federal government to return to work so they can restore some predictability and reliability to our economy and continue to be the partner that we need to ensure the economic health and prosperity of Wisconsin workers.”

And officials in Kansas, New Hampshire and New Mexico have warned their residents could miss their food assistance payments for November. More than 42 million Americans rely on the program, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture administers. The federal government funds nearly all the program benefits, with states administering the program.Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins warned Thursday that SNAP will run out of funds in two weeks if Congress fails to strike a deal and end the government shutdown.“You're talking about millions and millions of vulnerable families of hungry families that are not going to have access to these programs because of this shutdown,” she said outside the White House Thursday. USDA could not be reached for comment Friday. USDA has directed regional SNAP directors to stop working on benefits for November, according to an Oct. 10 letter obtained by Politico, written by the program’s acting associate administrator, Ronald Ward. “Considering the operational issues and constraints that exist in automated systems, and in the interest of preserving maximum flexibility, we are forced to direct States to hold their November issuance files and delay transmission to State EBT vendors until further notice,” Ward wrote. “This includes on-going SNAP benefits and daily files.” USDA has already shuffled more than $300 million in tariff revenue into the agency’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC, through the rest of the month. The shutdown started Oct. 1 after Congress failed to find a bipartisan path forward on a stopgap spending bill. Senate Democrats have pushed for negotiations to extend the enhanced tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Republicans have insisted on passing the House’s version of the stopgap funding bill that does not address insurance premiums.",,,,2025-10-17 15:57:44.706869

Gen. Craig Strong at left and Nebraska Department of Correctional Services Director Rob Jeffreys as the state announces a new ICE facility. Aug 19. 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The State of Nebraska officially signed a contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Sept. 30 to convert the state prison in McCook into an ICE detention facility, officials announced Friday.
Under the initial two-year, 183-page contract, ICE plans to pay Nebraska $2.5 million each month to house federal detainees, adult males and females, at Nebraska’s Work Ethic Camp — a daily bed rate of $269.17 per detainee. In the second year, ICE payments to Nebraska would rise by 3%.
The Work Ethic Camp previously had an annual operating cost of $10.2 million and a daily bed rate of $199.50 per inmate. It housed only male inmates.
Gov. Jim Pillen’s office said the contract would annually net Nebraska about $14.25 million. ICE agreed to also pay Nebraska a one-time lump sum of $5.9 million for “facility renovations.” 
Projected cost savings
Kenny Zoeller, director of the governor’s Policy Research Office, which is largely Pillen’s main legislative lobbying arm, said in an email to state senators Friday that the arrangement is “designed to maximize fiscal benefit.”
“This new revenue model, when weighed against the current annual facility operating expense from general funds, demonstrates a significant financial advantage for the State of Nebraska,” Zoeller wrote.

Pillen’s office said the facility, which officials have said would be rebranded the “Cornhusker Clink,” will remain state-owned, and the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services will continue to run it. 
Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys signed the contract on behalf of Nebraska. The contract states Nebraska and ICE could agree to use the Work Ethic Camp this way for up to five years.
Pillen’s office now estimates that the state could begin accepting detainees before November. Jeffreys has said he hopes the facility can be a “Midwest hub” for immigration enforcement.
“I’m very grateful to President Trump and Secretary Kristi Noem of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for their strong leadership in securing our nation’s southern border and addressing illegal immigration through initiatives like this,” Pillen said Friday in a statement.
Minors are not supposed to be housed at the repurposed prison. Any young people sent there must be relocated within 72 hours and be housed away from adults during that time, the contract states.
‘Public has a right to know’
State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha blasted the contract Friday as “not just morally wrong, it’s unconstitutional” because of legislative checks and balances. She criticized provisions in the contract that ban videotaping, recording and public access to the state-owned facility, which would be contrary to how other state facilities operate.
“Nebraska taxpayers are funding this prison, and the public has a right to know what’s happening inside,” Hunt said. “When oversight is blocked, abuse thrives.”

Hunt said that if ICE or state officials bar senators from conducting oversight, it would violate the separation of powers and obstruct lawmakers’ constitutional duties.
It wasn’t immediately clear why officials did not release the contract for 17 days after Jeffreys and an unnamed federal official signed it Sept. 30, hours before the ongoing federal shutdown. Pillen’s office and Jeffreys’ agency had denied multiple public records requests over that span, including one from the Examiner requesting a copy of the contract on Oct. 2.
Prison transition specifics
Attorney Jennifer Huxoll in the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office told a Red Willow County District Court judge Thursday that she did not know when the facility would open but that all state inmates had been moved out. A Correctional Services spokesperson could not immediately answer Friday specifically where the inmates had been relocated.
Zoeller said all remaining state inmates were transferred to other facilities last week. There were 186 inmates at the facility on Aug. 19 when Pillen announced the plan.

Huxoll had also indicated Nebraska had entered multiple contracts, though she did not specify with whom. Jeffreys’ agency is currently contracting with a Lincoln-based fencing company for $750,000 to build a razor-wire fence around the Work Ethic Camp, which Huxoll said Thursday was 90% complete. 
Zoeller said internal modifications will continue so Nebraska can house up to 300 detainees, up from about 200, and allow for virtual and in-person attorney visits and court proceedings. Providing additional housing and legal space will involve converting rehabilitative programming space. Zoeller said an intruder detection system had also been installed, and armed staff will constantly patrol the perimeter.
Staffing will increase from 97 full-time employees to 171. Zoeller said the new positions will provide coverage for repurposed spaces, housing units and transportation. Transportation will be reimbursed monthly at $10,816.67, with regular and overtime rates for on-call guards.
Minimum staffing levels required of the state under the contract have been redacted, as has information on handling emergency situations in receiving or discharging detainees.
“NDCS has developed staff training specific to the management of the detainee population and is exploring options to allow for the utilization of electronic translation services to assist non-English speaking detainees,” Zoeller said.
Separation of powers lawsuit
State lawmakers created the Work Ethic Camp in 1997 at the request of then-Gov. Ben Nelson, a McCook native and the state’s last Democratic governor. It opened four years later. The prison is primarily designed to reduce Nebraska prison crowding by moving out low-risk offenders and making space for more violent offenders elsewhere.
Thirteen McCook residents, plus a former state lawmaker, filed a lawsuit Wednesday to try to stop the transition and reopening of the Work Ethic Camp. They argue that because Pillen and Jeffreys did not receive legislative approval first, the transition of the facility violates the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches.
13 McCook residents, former lawmaker sue to stop Nebraska-ICE detention center

Red Willow District Judge Patrick Heng will hear arguments next Friday on whether to grant a temporary injunction. He declined this week to block further action in the meantime.
State officials did not immediately answer whether they would begin to accept federal detainees before the temporary injunction motion could be heard. A temporary injunction would pause action until the lawsuit can be more holistically argued and evaluated.
In 1958, voters gave the Legislature authority over the “general management, control and government” of all state penal institutions. The latest lawsuit targets that constitutional provision as well as a state law that says state agencies can’t change or divert from the “use or purpose, kind or class” of public buildings in which lawmakers have appropriated tax dollars for.
Pillen has previously argued state law gives him authority through the creation of the Corrections Department, plus a clause in the Nebraska Constitution that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.”
Nick Grandgenett, an attorney on behalf of the McCook residents, told District Judge Heng that state law also does not give Jeffreys’ agency the authority to house federal detainees.
“At its core, this is not about immigration,” Grandgenett said Thursday. “This is about our constitutional republican form of government.”

(Photo courtesy of Iowa DNR) The Iowa Department of Natural Resources is investigating a hog manure spill in Louisa County that has resulted in a small number of dead fish in an unnamed tributary. 
According to a DNR news release, a crew from the manure application business Catnip Ridge was applying manure to a field Thursday when a break in a line caused an unknown amount of manure to spill into a tributary of Roff Creek. 
DNR said the applicator team took “immediate action” to stop pumping and to clamp the line once the tear, which DNR later discovered was from friction against an iron fence post hidden in some vegetation, was discovered.

According to the news release, the spill occurred in a road ditch northeast of Winfield at the intersection of Q Avenue and 65th Street. The Catnip Ridge crew placed dams in several areas along the tributary and plugged a nearby culvert to keep the manure from entering the creek, DNR reported. 
Fresh water was added to the spilled area to help the crew flush the tributary and pump out the spilled manure. When DNR staff assessed the scene Thursday, initial water monitoring tests showed elevated levels of  ammonia, but staff did not observe any dead fish. 
According to the release, when staff returned Friday morning to the site, “a small number of dead fish were observed” in the tributary, but the plugged culvert had prevented further downstream migration of the manure. 
DNR will continue to monitor the cleanup efforts and investigate the incident to determine if further enforcement action is necessary.



When to apply manure
Iowa State University Extension and Outreach holds that farmers should wait to apply manure to fields until soil temperatures drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit to minimize nitrification in the soil. According to the Iowa Environmental Mesonet, soil temperatures across the state are not expected to drop below that level until the end of October.

June 14, 2025 | Photo by Jon KingMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said Friday that President Donald Trump and his supporters were attempting to stir up anxiety, fear and violence ahead of the planned weekend No Kings protests, all under the guise of provoking a federal law enforcement response.
That statement, issued Friday in a news release from Nessel’s office, was evidenced by a bizarre statement made by a local Metro Detroit GOP official, who warned in a vague email that left-wing agitators were planning to infiltrate and derail Saturday’s protests in Michigan.
More than 100 communities from southeast Michigan to the westernmost part of the U.P. are set to hold “No Kings” rallies in support of civil rights, democracy and the rule of law. The protests are expected to attract millions of people nationwide to speak out against the Trump administration and the numerous anti-democratic policies enacted by his office in his second term.
A large turnout on Oct. 18, across the state and nation, would be the biggest litmus test yet for the growing movement against the Trump administration. As such, various far-right pundits, members of the Republican Party and the White House itself have been attempting to blunt that momentum by warning that members of the loosely organized antifascist Antifa movement and other left-wing agitators were planning to cause trouble.
On Thursday evening, Oakland County GOP Chair Vance Patrick joined them in stirring the pot with an email containing unsubstantiated and unsourced claims that an incoming “mobilization” of left-wing trouble makers were headed for Michigan’s protests.
Patrick and the county’s GOP branch said it believed that included “the Communist Party USA, the Freedom Socialist Party, and the Democratic Socialists of America.” Patrick and his office also claimed that those groups have a history of causing unrest in communities.
Again, Patrick did not point to any credible threat issued by law enforcement, nor any credible news source indicating that such a situation was occurring.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Still, Patrick doubled down, claiming that attendees at earlier No Kings rallies held in June called for Trump’s assassination or violence against law enforcement.
“Our county will not be intimidated by organizations whose only aim is to sow chaos and division,” Patrick said. “The Oakland County Republican Party stands for law and order, and we reject the radical and violent tactics that have become the hallmark of the No Kings movement and its extremist sponsors. It is time for everyone, regardless of political affiliation, to denounce violence and work toward a safer, more united community.” 
Patrick also said that conservative activists had expressed an interest in forming a counter-demonstration, but the Oakland GOP was recommending that they avoid the protest due to concerns for their safety.
“Our first priority will always be the safety and well-being of our supporters,” Patrick said. “We strongly urge everyone to stay away from these events and to avoid any confrontations that could put you in harm’s way.”
On Friday, Christine McGillivray, executive director of Voters Not Politicians, one of the organizers of the Michigan protests, reiterated that the movement was peaceful and the demonstrations would remain that way. In a statement to Michigan Advance, McGillivray also responded directly to Patrick’s veiled warning.
“All across our state, your neighbors will be waving flags alongside children and their grandparents. We love this country, but are alarmed at what the Trump Administration is doing – using the military against US citizens, masked agents abducting people off the streets, prosecuting his political opponents,” McGillivray said. “These things are totally un-American. Smearing tens of thousands of Michiganders standing up for our rights is quite sad. But don’t take my word for it – do your own research! Come visit a No Kings demonstration and make up your own mind. There are more than 100 across the state, so there’s certainly one near you.”

Nessel also responded, encouraging people from all walks of life to show up and have their voices heard in the face of growing authoritarianism from Trump and his supporters.
“The No Kings protests happening across Michigan and the country are powerful opportunities for people to make their voices heard,” Nessel said. “I  encourage everyone who wants to participate to make signs, bring your friends, and stand together for what you believe in.”
Nessel also called out officials and pundits, like Patrick and others on social media, for trying to cause a panic that would ultimately give the Trump administration the justification it would need to step in and crack down on the First Amendment rights of millions of protesters.
“At the same time, we have seen a troubling pattern wherein the Trump Administration and his supporters are already attempting to squash the movement’s momentum and scare attendees by predicting violence and labeling this legal protest an act of terrorism,” Nessel said. “We know from this Administration’s actions from coast to coast that they are looking for any reason to invoke the Insurrection Act. We must deny them that justification and protest peacefully and lawfully.”
The attorney general also asked all those who attend to remember the core values of the nonviolent protest movement, as acting otherwise would be antithetical to “responsible civic engagement.”
“When protests turn chaotic, our voices are drowned out, the safety of protestors and public safety officers may be jeopardized, and it hands the White House the excuse they so badly want to abuse and test the limits of their constitutional authority,” Nessel said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9137-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-17 15:57:44.706869

Wright announced forthcoming furloughs of federal nuclear weapons workers on Oct. 16, 2025.(Photo by Anna Padilla for Source New Mexico)National Nuclear Security Administration employees could face layoffs as soon as Friday if the federal shutdown continues, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in an Oct. 16 appearance on Bloomberg TV, a message he reiterated to USA Today.
“We have not furloughed anyone yet, but we will be out of funds by tomorrow or early next week. So we will be forced to do that if this shutdown continues,” Wright said on Bloomberg. “We’ve been paying them to date, but starting tomorrow, Monday at the latest, we’re not going to be able to pay those workers, if that continues on for long, they may get other jobs,” Wright, putting the “the sovereignty of the country,” at stake.
The NNSA is a section of DOE that oversees the nation’s nuclear stockpile and development of nuclear weapons and waste, including programs for Sandia National Laboratories, Los Alamos National Laboratory and other programs such as nuclear disposal near Carlsbad.
U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Alabama), who chairs the House Armed Services Committee, underscored the message Friday morning during a U.S. House of Representatives news conference, when he said he had been told the NNSA would furlough most of the staf— about 80% of employees.
“We were just informed last night, the National Nuclear Security Administration, the group that handles the nuclear stockpile, that the carryover funding they’ve been using is about to run out,” he said Friday. “…These are not employees that you want to go home. They are managing and handling a very important strategic asset for us. They need to be at work and being paid,” he said.
He also told CBS News that the NNSA told his office the agency would place roughly 1,400 employees on furlough and 375 would continue to work.
Neither Wright nor other officials have said where furloughs will occur.
A spokesperson for Los Alamos National Laboratory told Source via an emailed statement that LANL “has funds in place to continue operations. We focus on maintaining the safety and security of our employees and facilities.”
An automatic response from Sandia National Laboratories stated that they are “open and employees are reporting for work. The Labs will operate in the short-term using unspent funding.”
In a statement, Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) said the DOE had not provided any information on site-specific impacts, but called Wright’s comments an “excuse.”
“In New Mexico and across the country, workers at our National Labs or other defense-related facilities are crucial for our national security. At this time, LANL and Sandia continue to operate at full capacity to deliver the cutting-edge research, technologies, and capabilities that keep our nation safe,” Luján said in a statement to Source NM. “Now, Secretary Wright and the Trump administration have used the government shutdown as an excuse to threaten these critical jobs. Secretary Wright and the Trump administration must prioritize this vital workforce to protect our national security.”
Requests for comment from other members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation remained pending Friday. This story will be updated if needed.
Phone lines for media contacts at Sandia National Laboratories and local NNSA offices all had out-of-office messages, and deferred further comments about the shutdown to the U.S. Department of Energy press office.
Voicemails and emails to public affairs at the Department of Energy went unanswered Friday morning.
The lack of information about furloughs and the shutdown is “dispiriting,” Dylan Spaulding, the senior scientist in the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy group, told Source NM Friday.
“It conveys that the NNSA and Department of Energy are not reliable employers,” he said. “I think the best and greatest scientists in particular will move to opportunities elsewhere. The danger is, once those people are lost, they never come back, so even if the furloughs stop, even if the shutdown ends, funding is resumed, you’ve done some irreparable damage.”
Local anti-nuclear groups said the furlough was contradictory to the administration’s push to develop nuclear power and weapons.
“I think this is mostly theatrical and designed to bring Democrats to the bargaining table,”Greg Mello, the executive director of nuclear nonproliferation nonprofit Los Alamos Study Group, said. ”However, if NNSA’s unspent balances are not in the categories they need, they may well have to furlough people, and they might even furlough people as part of the theater.”
Don Hancock, director of the Nuclear Waste Safety program at the Southwest Research and Information Center, criticized the “lack of transparency” from the federal government about what impacts this may have on nuclear weapons stockpiles and waste work in New Mexico.
“What I don’t understand is why this shutdown is so different from the 35-day one in the first Trump administration when they didn’t get rid of 80% of the NSA folks,” Hancock said.

Verde, 1507 State St., Bettendorf — During an Oct. 2 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this restaurant for 17 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number. The inspector found that the establishment was open and operating without a valid food-service license, as the previous license had expired and had not been renewed.
Also, there was no certified food protection manager on staff, and multiple food items — including red salsa dated Aug. 14, bean puree dated Aug. 18, wine sauce dated July 11, and mango habanero dated Sept. 12 — were being held long past the maximum of seven days and had to be discarded.
In addition, raw whole cuts of beef were stored above fresh herbs and cooked rice inside a cooler, risking cross-contamination; several containers in the clean-dish rack were marred by “bits of leftover food debris;” the interior of the large ice bin was marred by an accumulation of grime; the sanitizing dishwashing machine in the bar area was not properly functioning; a container of raw, improperly stored fish had to be discarded, and food was being packaged in reduced-oxygen, or vacuum-sealed, packaging without the required approval.
Also, a bag of onions, a box of tortillas, and a box of eggs were being stored directly on the floor of the walk-in cooler; the stainless steel rolling cart had a buildup of spilled grease and food debris, and the air filters above the cooking equipment contained a buildup of dust and grease.
Brady’s Bar & Grill, 113 N. Washington St., Edgewood – During an Oct. 9 visit, a state inspector cited this establishment for 12 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. Among the issues: The staff was assembling sandwiches with their bare hands and there was no soap available at either the bar or dish-room handwashing sinks; there was “adulterated” pizza sauce and alfredo sauce in the pizza preparation table that had to be discarded, and various food items — including sausage, ham, shredded cheese, coleslaw and cottage cheese — were being stored at temperatures above the maximum of 41 degrees.
Also, the shredded pork, chicken breasts, in-house ranch dressing, in-house salsa, and in-house bacon jam were not marked with dates to ensure freshness and safety. In addition, the microwave oven “appeared unclean” and the establishment’s current license was not posted.
The Bettplex, 4850 Competition Drive, Bettendorf – During an Oct. 8 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this restaurant for multiple products throughout the main kitchen that had been held for longer than the maximum seven days, including Canadian bacon and lettuce dated Sept. 25, bean sauce dated Oct. 1, ranch dressing dated Sept. 30, beer cheese dated Sept. 26 and brisket dated Sept. 28.
Also, access to the handwashing sink was blocked by trash cans positioned in front of it, and several prepared food products — including bags of cooked noodles, cooked chicken, cheese sauce and deli meat — had been held for more than 24 hours without proper date-markings to ensure freshness and safety.
In addition, several pizzas that had been prepared four days earlier and were stored on an open rack in a cooler had “a small accumulation of mold growth on them.”  The inspector also reported an accumulation of fruit flies around two floor drains behind the main bar.
Cabos Cantina & Grill, 1500 E. LeClaire Road, Eldridge – During an Oct. 1 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this establishment for 10 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. Among the issues: rice on the main hot-holding line in the kitchen had not been reheated to 165 degrees within two hours as required; raw chicken and raw steak in the refrigerated drawers below the grill were holding at 43 to 45 degrees rather than 41 degrees or colder; several knives stored as clear were marred by food debris, and several cans of Raid insecticide, not approved for use in commercial food establishments, were found in the utility room.
Also, the chlorine dishwashing machine was operating with no detectable levels of sanitizing solution; frozen fish had not been removed from reduced-oxygen packaging before thawing, increasing the risk that any spoilage would go undetected; in-use utensils in the bar area were being stored in standing, room-temperature water, and hot tortillas were being stored in plastic, grocery-style bags rather than in a food-grade container.
Dynasty Buffet (listed in inspection reports as Gog Dynasty Buffet), 5388 Elmore Ave., Davenport – During an Oct. 7 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this restaurant for 11 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. Among the problems: Employees handled vegetables using their bare hands; raw chicken and seafood were stored above ready-to-eat food items in a cooler, risking cross-contamination; kitchen knives and the ice machines used for customers’ drinks were marred by “debris and gunk;” employees were seen eating food off the cutting board surface rather eating at a table in the dining area; the dishwashing machine was not properly sanitizing dishes; multiple food products were stored on the floor of the walk-in cooler, and multiple food products had been left uncovered in the kitchen.
Also, dented cans of food were found in the establishment, and one cooler was storing food products at temperatures of up to 50 degrees rather than 41 degrees or colder. In addition, frozen fish was left to thaw at room temperature in the kitchen, fly strips were hanging in several areas of the kitchen, and spoons and scoops used for food were “crusty and had debris buildup.”










No foods were date-marked with a production or discard date ... Frozen meat was thawing in large pots of water on the floor in the back of the kitchen.


– State inspector's report for the Colfax Truck Stop 


Colfax Truck Stop, 1405 N. Walnut St., Colfax – During a Sept. 25 visit, a state inspector cited this establishment for nine risk-factor violations. Among the problems: Cartons of raw eggs from an unapproved private flock were offered for sale in a reach-in cooler and had to pulled from sale. Also, the individual in charge could not provide the name of an approved source for the large metal pan of yogurt found inside a walk-in cooler or for “the plastic grocery bags of frozen meat” found inside a walk-in freezer.
In addition, the pastry stored in a hot-holding case was measured at 114 to 120 degrees and had to be discarded. The establishment, the inspector reported, “does not have a date-marking system for time- and temperature-controlled foods that require date-marking. No foods were date-marked with a production or discard date.” The inspector also found that equipment and utensils were not being sanitized after washing, and reported that cutting boards, utensils, and storage containers were marred by “food debris and buildup” on their surfaces.
“Cooked chickpeas and cooked chicken were cooling at room temperature with no temperature monitoring,” the inspector reported. “Frozen meat was thawing in large pots of water on the floor in the back of the kitchen.”
All Pho You, 4120 University Ave., Des Moines – During an Oct. 7 visit, a state inspector noted that meat cooked days before had been left in the cooler and freezer with no date-markings to ensure freshness and safety. The inspector also made note of sausage with “visible contamination and discoloration” and found that the person in charge was not a certified food protection manager as required. During the restaurant’s previous routine inspection, in October 2024, it was cited for 13 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number.
Hy-Vee Foods, 1720 Waterfront Drive, Iowa City – During an Oct. 6 visit, a Johnson County inspector noted that the diced tomatoes in the pizza refrigeration unit were being stored at 47 degrees rather than 41 degrees or colder. Also, cooked items, including pork ribs and smoked pulled pork, were stored in a cooler at 44 and 47 degrees and had to be discarded.
In addition, several items in the produce area’s cooler — such as Margaritaville salsa, black bean and corn salsa, and guacamole salsa — were being held at temperatures above 41 degrees and had to be discarded. The store was also using a nonapproved, noncontinuous method of cooking chicken, and the smoked chicken that was stored in a hot-holding unit in the Market Grill area was being held at 129 degrees – too cool to ensure its safety – and had to be discarded.
The inspector also reported that partially cooked chicken stored on a preparation table in the Chinese food area was measured at 90 degrees and had to be discarded, and raw ground beef was being stored above raw pork steaks in a self-service meat cooler, risking cross-contamination. Also, the handwashing sinks in the meat department were found to have no hot water supply.
Olive Tree Café, 2513 53rd Ave., Bettendorf – During an Oct. 6 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this restaurant for food-contact surfaces that had a “buildup of soil and/or food debris” and required additional cleaning.  Also, three cans of food had severe dents along their rims or seams and had to be discarded, one container of quinoa prepared on Sept. 29 had been held for more than the maximum seven days, and there was no certified food protection manager on site each day.
Fas Mart, 1200 Locust St., Glenwood – During a Sept. 30 visit, a state inspector noted that dishes were not being sanitized after washing, and food products were being chilled in an open-air cooler at 58 degrees – too warm to ensure safety. Also, the handwashing sink in the dish room had no hot water supply, and the drain for the handwashing sink was not connected, allowing water to drain directly onto the floor. In addition, the establishment’s most recent inspection report was not posted in a location that allowed consumers to read it. According to state records, the establishment last underwent a routine inspection in October 2020.
Hy-Vee Foods, 1125 N. Dodge St., Iowa City – During a Sept. 30 visit, a Johnson County inspector noted that the interior of the ice machine in the Market Grill area was marred by a buildup of unspecified debris, and numerous items – including diced and sliced tomatoes, cheese, deli sandwiches and wraps, and ready-to-eat salami, diced pancetta, and Columbus pepperoni panini – were being held at temperatures above 41 degrees and had to be discarded.
Also, the veggie wash used in the Market Grill area had no detectable level of cleaning solution; food employees in the meat department and deli sandwich section did not wash their hands before putting on gloves and handling food; and the most recent inspection report had not been posted.
Foundry Food & Tap, 5055 Competition Drive, Bettendorf – During a Sept. 29 visit, a Scott County inspector noted that multiple food-contact surfaces throughout the kitchen were marred by a buildup of soil, food debris and grime. The soiled areas included the food-preparation tables, the shelves of the reach-in freezer, the interior of all the refrigerated drawers of a cook-line cooler, the interior of the hot-holding food cabinets, the onion dicer and storage pan, and the ice scoop.
“All surfaces require additional cleaning and sanitizing,” the inspector reported.
In addition, three pans of food containing pulled pork, rice and vegetables had no date-markings to ensure freshness and safety. Also, one cooler was holding food product at between 46 and 53 degrees, rather than 41 degrees or colder, and so the food was discarded. Another cooler that was being used to store raw chicken, fish, and breading products was holding food at 47 to 50 degrees, and so that food was discarded. The restaurant also had to discard a container of boneless wings that were being held at 53 degrees, as well as improperly thawed vacuum-sealed salmon filets.
Smoke N Firehouse No. 20, 103 W. Maple St., Ringsted — During a Sept. 19 visit, a Siouxland District Health Department inspector cited this restaurant for 13 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number.
Among the problems: A bag of hamburger buns that showed “the presence of mold” and had to be discarded; multiple foods stored in all three of the reach-in coolers had been left uncovered, risking contamination; raw ground beef was left sitting on a counter at room temperature; there was no system in place for date-marking foods that were time- and temperature-controlled; cut tomatoes, cooked pulled pork, taco meat, and cooked ground beef had all been held for more than the maximum of seven days and had to be discarded; and the chemical dishwasher was operating with no detectable levels of sanitizing solution.
In addition, the kitchen utensils were soiled; a handwashing sink was filled with dirty dishes; a can of Hot Shot bug spray, not approved for use in commercial food establishments, was located in the kitchen, and the fryers, flat-top grill and coolers were visibly soiled with a buildup of food debris.
“Kitchen walls and floors are heavily soiled with food debris, especially around kitchen equipment,” the inspector reported. The visit was in response to a non-illness complaint concerning general sanitation. The complaint was deemed verified.
Hy-Vee Foods, 1700 E. Washington St., Mount Pleasant – During a Sept. 18 visit, a Lee County inspector cited this store for 10 risk-factor violations. Among the problems: Raw,  seasoned chicken was stored on top of seasoned ribs on a cart in the walk-in cooler, risking cross-contamination; rotisserie chickens in the hot-holding case ranged from 125 to 130 degrees, which was not hot enough to ensure their safety, and had to be reheated to at least 165 degrees; and various cold items, such as cheese and tomatoes were stored at 48 degrees in the sandwich-prep cooler.
Also, the dishwashing machine in the bakery area was not reaching the minimum of 160 degrees, and the written log documenting sushi preparation was incomplete and missing some of the required information.

Free.,Former Trump aide Bolton pleads not guilty to mishandling classified information,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/former-trump-aide-bolton-pleads-not-guilty-mishandling-classified-information,,"Former National Security Advisor John Bolton pleaded not guilty in Maryland federal court Friday to eight counts of unlawful transmission of national defense information and 10 counts of unlawful retention of national defense information.He was released from custody on personal recognizance bond, meaning he did not have to post bail but did have to surrender his passport and pledge not to leave the country. The next hearing was scheduled for Nov. 21.In a statement shortly after an indictment against him was returned Thursday, Bolton said the prosecution was engineered by President Donald Trump in retaliation for criticism the longtime national security official had leveled against his one-time boss.Bolton said the material he used for his 2020 book on his time as Trump’s national security advisor had been cleared for publication, and that he made the FBI aware of a 2021 hack of his private email.During President Joe Biden’s four years in office, reviews of his case did not result in indictment, he continued. But federal law enforcement during Trump’s second presidency has sought to prosecute individuals opposed to the president, he said.“These charges are not just about his focus on me or my diaries, but his intensive effort to intimidate his opponents, to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct,” the statement said. “Dissent and disagreement are foundational to America’s constitutional system, and vitally important to our freedom. I look forward to the fight to defend my lawful conduct and to expose his abuse of power.”Bolton was formally charged Friday with the 18-count indictment that accused him of transcribing handwritten notes containing classified information onto a word processor and sharing the material in the form of “diary” entries with two family members who were not cleared to receive classified information.Bolton’s is the third indictment federal officials have secured in recent weeks against high-profile Trump critics. Former FBI Director James Comey was charged with lying to Congress following a major fallout in a Virginia federal prosecutor’s office that was widely reported to be over career staff refusing to proceed in the case against Comey.New York Attorney General Leticia James was also indicted for charges related to a mortgage application.Like Bolton, both Comey and James have proclaimed their innocence and said they were being persecuted as Trump critics.",,,,2025-10-17 15:57:44.706869

(Courtesy of Maggie Shama)Maggie Shama thought she and her husband Mohamed Shama had finally cleared their last hurdle. After years of navigating the complex immigration system, they were moments away from securing his legal status.
At the immigration office in Raleigh on Oct. 9, Maggie, who has been married to Shama since 2017, was the first to be interviewed for their marriage-based green card. The officer told her everything looked good, and that unless her husband’s answers drastically differed, their case would be approved, she said.
Relieved, she left the room and walked toward Shama, who was waiting. As he was called in for his turn, she kissed him and said, “We got this,” before taking a seat in the waiting room.
The couple had spent much of their lives together fighting to secure Shama’s legal status, and this was supposed to bring an end to years of uncertainty.
But soon, everything changed.
Despite being told they had passed the interview, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents entered the office and took Shama into custody.
“I was dumbfounded,” Maggie said during a phone interview. “I kept saying, ‘But we were approved. I don’t understand what’s happening.’”
The arrest stems from a prior deportation order dating back years. Though he had followed every legal step to resolve his case, the longtime Durham resident now faces the possibility of being deported to Egypt, the country he left behind years ago.
NC Newsline contacted ICE to confirm Shama’s story. The agency referred us to U.S. Customs and Immigration Services. That agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Shama is among immigrants affected by the Trump administration’s expanded deportation policies. The administration has prioritized the removal of anyone with a prior deportation order, even those married to U.S. citizens or with pending legal cases.
According to the Department of Homeland Security, over 2 million individuals have left the United States in less than 250 days, including an estimated 1.6 million who voluntarily self-deported.
Immigration advocates say the approach has upended families who had been following the legal process for years.
“They just wouldn’t listen,” said Maggie, who suffers from spinal stenosis and depends on Shama for daily care. “Even when our lawyer and the interviewer said he was approved, the ICE agent said, ‘I don’t care. We have an order to deport.’”
Despite her health issues, Maggie has spent the days since the arrest calling lawyers and coordinating with friends to keep Shama’s story visible.
Shama, who has two children from a previous marriage, has lived in North Carolina for more than a decade. He worked his way up to general manager at AMC Theatres in Durham, earning the company’s national 2022 General Manager of the Year award, according to the GoFundMe page, and was recognized by former Durham Mayor Steve Schewel for hiring people with special needs.
“He’s the face of the building,” said Raul Navedo, a close friend and former colleague who met Shama in 2017. “People light up when they see him walking around.”
That same warmth has fueled an outpouring of support since his arrest. Friends and former coworkers quickly rallied around Maggie, launching a GoFundMe that has already surpassed its first goal. The fundraising page outlines Shama’s transfers from the Cary Detention Center to the Alamance County Jail, and then to the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia — one of the nation’s largest immigration facilities.
Donations are being used to cover legal fees and family expenses. Organizers say the money will help file motions to stay his deportation, prepare a writ of habeas corpus, and, if necessary, pay for airfare should Shama be forced to self-deport and continue his case from abroad.
The legal path remains uncertain. One attorney said that because a removal order is already in place, a motion to stay has only a slim chance of success; another estimated a 50% chance. That leaves the painful possibility that Shama’s best option may be to self-deport — a move that could separate him from his wife and daughters for years.
The family also fears that if ICE carries out its own removal process, Shama could be sent to another country, since deportation flights to Egypt are rare.
Shama also suffers from health issues, including a suspected case of long COVID, and friends fear his health will worsen in detention.
Maggie said she misses the man who has been a caregiver and a companion all the years. The couple bonded over their shared love of movies, especially the comedy series Only Murders in the Building.
“It’s just so quiet in this house, it’s unbearable,” Maggie said through tears. “We crack each other up. It’s just what we do. I miss going to the movies with him, because that’s how we bonded. I miss the smell of his cologne; I miss his smile. I just miss everything.”
“At this point, it’s just, keep fighting,” she added.” We’re just gonna keep fighting and hope for the best.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-17 19:03:47+00:00,CT Mirror,Judge orders release of video of death of J’Allen Jones,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/17/jallen-jones-video-release/,The judge said the public interest in releasing the video of J'Allen Jones' death outweighed concerns raised by the Department of Correction.,"A Superior Court judge on Thursday ordered the Department of Correction to release the video showing the death of J’Allen Jones at Garner Correctional Institute in 2018. 
In her 11-page decision, Superior Court Judge Claudia Baio said that the Department of Correction had not sufficiently proved that the safety concerns that officials raised during a hearing in August were enough to override the public interest in the video’s release. 
Jones died in March 2018 after being pepper sprayed, restrained, struck and forcibly moved by as many as 10 corrections workers. In August 2018, Jones’ mother and girlfriend filed a lawsuit against the Department of Correction. The family has been petitioning the courts for the release of the video, along with the ACLU and the Connecticut Examiner. 
In August, the court heard arguments in favor of and against the release of the video. William Mulligan, the deputy commissioner of operations and rehabilitative services for the Department of Correction, said he was concerned that the release of certain portions of the video would create a security risk, allowing incarcerated individuals to map the facility and possibly plan an escape. 
He said he was also concerned that incarcerated individuals could discover the identities of the staff involved in the incident, which could create negative encounters among those staff members and the incarcerated. 
Mulligan proposed that the department allow the portion of the video in which Jones had been strip-searched, pinned down, pepper sprayed, struck and forcibly moved by corrections officers to be available for members of the public to view, but not distributed widely on the internet. The modified version of the video would not include segments in which Jones was transported from his cell into the inpatient medical area, or when he was transported from the medical area out to an ambulance. 
But Attorney Ron Murphy, who represented Jones’ family, argued that removing any part of the video would not do justice to Jones’ memory and would leave out critical information about Jones’ conduct the day he died. 
In her decision, Baio acknowledged the security concerns that Mulligan raised but maintained that the majority of the video could not be sealed, since it provided direct evidence of the central issue of the case — the actions of both Jones and the correction officers on the day of Jones’ death. 
“The defendants chose to submit the entire video in connection with their motion for summary judgement, rather than only a portion. Therefore, it is not reasonable for the defendants now to advocate that only a certain portion be publicly available,” the decision read. 
Baio ordered that the Department of Correction provide the video to the court within two weeks. The department will be allowed to blur out doors and door numbers, metal detectors and staff members who are not involved in the lawsuit. They are also permitted to erase radio transmissions between corrections officers “if they feel the conversation therein raises legitimate security concerns.” 
Baio noted that the number of people who attended the August hearing — including attorneys, criminal justice reform advocates and Jones’ mother — proved that the issue “had generated substantial public interest.” She also noted that the video was the primary evidence that the Department of Correction had presented in asking the court to dismiss the lawsuit without a trial, and that the public had a right to see that evidence “so that they can evaluate the court’s decision on that motion.” 
Advocates celebrated the video’s release but were mixed on whether the department should be allowed to redact even portions of the video. 
Barbara Fair, executive director of Stop Solitary, CT, said she was “ecstatic” that the department had released the video, and that “J’Allen did not die in vain.” But she said she was concerned that the Department of Correction could use the pretense of security concerns to blur out some of the most brutal actions that happened. 
She said she hoped the video would lead to changes in how the Department of Correction is held accountable. 
Attorney Alex Taubes, who is representing the Connecticut Examiner in a petition to intervene for the release of the video, called the judge’s ruling a “major victory for public accountability and transparency.” He said he disagrees with the need to redact parts of the video but “understands and respects” the judge’s decision. 
Correction ombuds DeVaughn Ward said the judge’s ruling proved that the state’s argument for concealing the video was “indefensible,” particularly since they themselves had presented it as part of their argument against the case going to trial. He said he plans to ask to see an unredacted version of the video and use that to make a recommendation to the Department of Correction on whether they should discipline the officers involved. 
Ward said he understood the need to redact parts of the video for security reasons and said the judge’s ruling struck the right balance. 
Dan Barrett, attorney for the ACLU, which filed a petition in October 2024 for the video’s immediate release and was denied, said he felt the judge was “absolutely correct” in her ruling.
“The court affirmed that documents filed by the government need to be seen by the public so we can evaluate our government institutions,” Barrett said. 
Asked about the redactions, Barrett said he felt the court had “struck the right balance,” since the redactions were intended to be very limited. 
Barrett pointed out that the prison system belongs to the public and said what happens inside “is done in our names.” 
Barrett said the real question now is whether Attorney General William Tong will release the video or attempt to file an appeal. 
“[Tong] really should stop fighting. The public needs to have access to this,” he said. 
Corrie Betts, the criminal justice chair for the Connecticut chapter of the NAACP, who praised the court ruling, said in a statement that representatives from the CT NAACP state conference had recently met with Tong, who reportedly told them that there was “nothing he could do” about releasing the video. 
“The court’s ruling now makes it clear that such a position is inconsistent with the positions of justice and accountability,” Betts said. 
Elizabeth Benton, the spokesperson for the Attorney General’s office, said their office was “reviewing the decision and evaluating next steps.” 
Andrius Banevicius, spokesperson for the Department of Correction, said the department was reviewing Baio’s decision “in order to determine the appropriate course of action.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025_0822_SR_JonesVideo_040-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-17 15:57:44.706869

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)TOPEKA — Kansas won’t release its monthly labor reports as a result of the federal government shutdown, the Kansas Department of Labor announced Friday.
September’s monthly jobs report and unemployment data were scheduled to publish Friday, but a lapse in funding for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics caused data collection, analysis and distribution activities to cease Oct. 1.
“This report provides the public with important information about the state of the Kansas labor market,” said Derek Helms, a spokesperson for the state labor department. “For example, are job estimates increasing or decreasing? Which industries are adding jobs? How many people are unemployed?”
Delayed data releases have arisen as one symptom of the federal government shutdown as it enters its third week, while state operations largely continue.
The monthly state report typically provides preliminary data on job estimates by industry, unemployment rates and labor estimates, Helms said. It is the state-level equivalent of the monthly U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Situation report. Jobs and labor data, even if preliminary, inform key economic indicators.
“The immediate impact is a delay in access to this important information about the Kansas labor market,” Helms said. “The official statistics used by analysts, economists and policymakers are only available through August 2025. Estimates for more recent time periods won’t be available until federal operations resume.”
Kansas’ unemployment rate has remained steadily around 3.8% in the past year, according to data through August. The state lost 4,700 nonfarm jobs and 1,300 private sector jobs in August. Kansas ranked near last in the nation for percentage gain in nonfarm payroll employment in the past year, according to the data.
Between July and August, the state’s leisure and hospitality services sector was the best performing, gaining around 600 jobs. State and local government and trades, transportation and utilities were the worst performing. The government sector lost around 3,500 jobs and the trades lost around 2,100. 
The government sector has been on the decline for the past year, according to the data. It has remained the worst performing sector with a loss of around 9,200 between August 2024 and August 2025. 
The private education and health services and financial activities sectors were the strongest in the past year, gaining 3,300 and 2,600 jobs respectively.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/capitolsunsetsept302025-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-10-17 15:57:44.706869

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current) Rhode Island’s capital city is one step closer to tightening its rules on how local police interact with U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel.
The Providence City Council on Thursday unanimously granted its first passage of a series of rewrites to the city’s Community-Police Relations Act as a way to further to protect the city’s immigrant community from the Trump administration’s arrest and deportation agenda.
“In Providence, we take pride in being a welcoming city where every neighbor deserves to feel safe,” Councilor Miguel Sanchez, a co-sponsor of the amended ordinance, said in a statement. “Our immigrant neighbors are the backbone of this city, and they deserve safety, dignity, and accountability.” 
The initial approval comes over a week after dozens of residents urged the council’s Ordinance Committee to pass the measure to ensure that Providence police officers do not assist ICE.
Providence officials want to further prohibit police cooperation with ICE

Enacted in 2017 under then-Mayor Jorge Elorza, the Providence Community-Police Relations Act prohibits officers from assisting with federal immigration enforcement regardless of the reason the person is being detained, unless there is a criminal warrant issued for a person in Providence police custody.
But how strictly police adhere to the policy came into question after officers were filmed at the scene of an ICE arrest on Alverson Avenue on July 13 establishing a perimeter at the request of federal agents — an incident the Providence External Review Authority ruled “constituted prohibited assistance.”
The new language in the ordinance would bar Providence police from complying with any federal agency’s request for assistance — such as sharing information or controlling traffic — unless they provide a criminal warrant signed by a judge.
Schools, places of worship, health facilities and courts would be designated safe spaces, meaning federal immigration authorities can’t be granted access unless they have a judicial warrant or are “acting in response to a specific act of terrorism, national security threat or when there is the threat of imminent danger of violence.”
One provision had split some Democratic councilors during a committee hearing earlier in the month: a clause allowing community organizations to challenge potential violations and sue individual officers.
Such a clause drew concerns from Mayor Brett Smiley, who believed the language could open the city up to “frivolous lawsuits.”
That language was updated by the Council Thursday to clarify that organizations may only sue the city as a whole and only for a court to uphold one’s civil rights, not for monetary damages.
“It was already true in the ordinance, but there were requests that we clarify that,” City Council President Rachel Miller said in an interview Friday.
Smiley said in a statement Friday he supports the changes made by the council.
“These changes will help to protect our city from dangerous financial liabilities, continue to protect our immigrant communities and support our officers to continue their nationally recognized community policing practices,” Smiley said.
The council will be required to give second approval of the ordinance before it heads to the mayor’s desk. That next vote is scheduled for Thursday, Nov. 6.

Construction began Oct. 14, 2025 to restore the room. (Courtesy New Mexico General Services Department)Construction began this week to restore a room in the former New Mexico Capitol that served as the state Senate chambers for 60 years.
The “Red Room”—so named because of its old red decorations—housed the Senate beginning when the New Mexico Territorial Capitol was completed in Santa Fe in 1900, 12 years before New Mexico became a state. It remained the Senate chambers until 1966, when lawmakers moved into the Roundhouse. 
Two years later, state leaders renamed the old capitol the Bataan Memorial Building, in honor of 1,800 New Mexico National Guard soldiers who endured the Bataan Death March in World War II.
State officials expect to complete the $2.4 million restoration project late next summer, but many questions remain about what the “Red Room” will look like, including whether it will be red. 
Joe Vigil, spokesperson for the New Mexico General Services Department, told Source New Mexico Friday that state agencies collaborating on the redesign haven’t yet decided which version of the “Red Room” they’ll restore. 
It’s gone through several renovations over the last 125 years, he noted, so architects are still trying to figure out which architectural style they can restore it to the most faithfully. He expects they’ll make that decision soon.
How firefighters spared Fort Stanton from ‘a wildfire 170 years in the making’

“There’s still a lot of questions as to, was it built classical?” Vigil said of the different architectural styles. “Did it change to semi-territorial, Territorial? There’s going to be a recommendation in the next couple weeks as to what period we can actually verify, to go back to, because we don’t want to guess on it.”
To help them make that choice, state officials pored through photographs and documents to find details of the old designs. In July, the state Department of Cultural Affairs asked the public to submit any photos they might have of the room throughout its history. 
In its research, Vigil said the team found 1951 renovation plans, so using those plans is an option.
In the meantime, the room is closed to the public, deemed “uninhabitable“ due to falling ceiling tiles and other issues, Vigil said. Crews this week began removing balcony risers, doors, shutters, tiles and other fixtures in preparation for the room’s eventual rehabilitation. 
State officials announced in April the Bataan Memorial Building’s inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. Officials approved it for the State Register of Cultural Properties in December. 
In a statement the GSD released ahead of the renovation, project manager Marilyn Martinez said she hopes the restoration honors the building’s history and its namesake.
“Ultimately, we want to make this renovation worthy of what this building stands for,” she said. “We want it to be part of the memorial that represents those service members who served in Bataan. We want to match that energy and make it something worthy for them.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Red-Room-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-17 15:57:44.706869

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)A Kanawha County circuit judge on Friday ruled against a mother seeking a religious exemption to the state’s school compulsory vaccination law on behalf of her son.
Judge Richard Lindsay dismissed the lawsuit against the Kanawha County Board of Education, saying that the state’s school vaccination law — with no religious exemptions — passes the strict scrutiny legal standard that the government must meet when determining if its action is constitutional. 
“Vaccination of our children is a compelling state interest and it is pursuing the least restrictive means in order to satisfy that compelling interest and it is narrowly tailored to the extent that it is the only way possible to keep outbreaks of measles and other diseases and viruses… at bay,” Lindsay said. 
Nakesha Watson filed the complaint against the Kanawha County school board on behalf of KJ, III, her child. The state Bureau for Public Health granted KJ a religious exemption to the school vaccine requirements, but the school board is not letting him attend school without being vaccinated, according to the complaint. 
Watson, who’s acting as her own attorney, did not show up to a hearing originally planned for Wednesday nor to a rescheduled hearing Friday morning. 
The case is one of a handful filed against school officials on the basis of Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s executive order in January requiring the state to offer religious and philosophical exemptions for school vaccination requirements. The executive order is based on the state’s 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act. Morrisey has argued that the school vaccination law should be read alongside EPRA to allow religious exemptions.
All states require students to be vaccinated against a series of infectious diseases including measles, chicken pox and polio. West Virginia has been one of only five to allow only medical exemptions to those requirements. Morrisey has not rescinded his executive order even though the Legislature this year rejected a bill that would have codified the exemptions. 
Lindsay on Friday further ruled that Morrisey’s executive order does not have authority in the matter. 
“The court also finds that the governor through his executive order is not empowered to make law,” Lindsay said. “That is empowered and entrusted by our state Legislature. And on three occasions since [Equal Protection for Religion Act] has become law, the Legislature has refused the amendment of the [Compulsory Vaccination Law] for religious and or philosophical exemptions. 
“It is the Legislature’s authority to make and or amend law and to pursue those and pass those exemptions, should they arise,” Lindsay said.
The ruling Friday comes just after a Raleigh County Circuit judge entered a ruling certifying that families across the state who have asked the state for a religious or philosophical exemption can be part of a class. Judge Michael Froble said he would enter a final ruling by the end of November on behalf of all the approximately 575 families who have asked the state Department of Health for religious or philosophical exemption.
In his order Thursday certifying the class, Froble defined the class as anyone who has sought, will in the future seek or has obtained a religious exemption to the state’s compulsory school vaccination law under the Equal Protection for Religion Act and those been denied access to school because of enforcement of the state’s school vaccination law. 
The class excludes those that have received final judgement for a similar lawsuit in another court. Parties who have filed lawsuits in other counties may join the Raleigh County class when they withdraw their pending claims with permission from the other court.
Froble in July granted a preliminary injunction allowing students in the Raleigh case to attend class with a religious exemption.
During that hearing, Froble ruled said the state’s mandatory school vaccine law is invalid without a religious exemption to the law. If there were any question, he said, the state’s Equal Protection for Religion Act makes it clear the law should make exceptions for religious beliefs. 
The issue seems destined to be decided by the state Supreme Court. The state Board of Education has already filed notice that it would appeal Froble’s July preliminary injunction ruling.
Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Corey Palumbo, an attorney representing the Kanawha County Board of Education, said Lindsay’s ruling was good. 
“I think he understands the clear language of the [compulsory vaccination law] does not provide for a religious exemption,” he said. “I think he understands the separation of powers argument. I think even if the EPRA does apply to the CVL, it passes strict scrutiny. So I think it’s a good ruling.”

(Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)Thousands of state employees and programs relied on by tens of thousands of Mainers are at risk if the federal government shutdown continues into November. 
Kirsten Figueroa, commissioner of the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services, gave the Legislature’s Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee an update on the impact of the shutdown on state finances and operations on Friday afternoon. 
“I’m not going to caveat it,” she said. “Just the fact of the matter is: the daily evaluation and also the daily information that comes in and then changes, it sometimes frustrates people because it doesn’t feel like they’re getting information fast enough.”
“But the fact of the matter is, we’re hearing something and we make a plan for that, and the next day we hear something that’s different, and so we are, right now, adjusting to all of that and doing the best that we can.”
Employees 
There are approximately 2,500 state of Maine employees whose jobs are funded, either entirely or in part by federal funds. According to DAFS’s evaluation, there is enough funding to cover employee pay through the end of October, though that’s being reevaluated daily. 
“After that, we will definitely be in a position in a number of our programs where we’ll have to start issuing layoff notices,” Figueroa said. 
One of the largest entities that the state would have to start considering layoffs for if the federal shutdown goes into November is the Maine Department of Defense, Veterans and Emergency Management, which has approximately 106 state employee positions that are fully or partially funded by the federal government.
Changes with federal employees outside of Maine would also have impacts on the state 
For example, earlier on Friday lawmakers discussed plans for how the state will conform with federal tax changes made in the GOP spending bill passed this summer.
“There was a lot of promise of technical assistance, guidance, updated forms, for instance, tax forms at the federal level that need to be changed as a result,” Figueroa said. “But as I’m sure that you all know, half — over 36,000 IRS employees — were furloughed.” 
Without that support, Figueroa expects implementation delays which, she said, “will only cause more confusion and probably mistakes as those things start to move.”
Grants
How long the state of Maine will be able to continue work funded by federal grants will be specific to each individual grant. 
“Which is, I know, an answer that sometimes frustrates,” Figueroa said, “but it really is dependent on what grant we’re talking about.”
And, she said, “when the funding runs out, the authority runs out.” The state won’t be able to move money that had been dedicated for a different purpose to help cover a grant serving another purpose. 
If the shutdown continues, some pauses are already expected. On October 10, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services was notified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service to pause or delay their November issuance of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP.
“If the current lapse in appropriations continues, there will be insufficient funds to pay full November food SNAP benefits for approximately 42 million individuals across the nation,” the notice read. 
With funding for courts in question, Congress stuck in shutdown gridlock for day 16

An estimated 172,000 Mainers receive SNAP benefits.
While the state has the authority and funding, agencies can try to alleviate the impact of the shutdown and postpone the impacts, Figueroa said.  
She used an example of a program that relies on federal match. If it has a $100 federal component and a $100 state general fund match and $2 is spent every day — $1 in federal money and $1 in state money —  then normally the program could last for 100 days.
Figueroa explained that without the federal component the state could “make the decision to spend $2 out of the match, because it’s the same authority, the same purpose, with the expectation that when this settles out then the feds will reimburse and then we go back to being able to replenish our match and move forward.”
However, that’s with the expectation that the federal government will eventually pass a budget that provides that reimbursement. 
Figueroa also said that if the state is put in the position where it has to cover a federal match or other federal expenses for a period of time, the administration would have to grant permission through financial orders, which require a 30-day wait. 
“Because we really wouldn’t have the opportunity to wait, it’s possible we would be coming to this committee with financial orders the longer this goes on,” she said. 
Long vs. short term solution 
How lawmakers in Washington, D.C., ultimately choose to end the shutdown will also have implications for Maine. 
For example, the Maine Department of Transportation has to pay certain obligations first, so if Congress passes an annual appropriation, it would provide the agency some flexibility. However, if there is only a short-term stopgap measure, funding would need to go toward those obligations.  
Figueroa said that would mean MDOT’s funding “could be significantly impacted if there isn’t a longer-term solution that comes out of this shutdown.”  
Currently, MDOT is paying about $27 million per week with its existing cash. That should get them through the next three weeks, Figueroa said, and with some financial orders likely three more weeks after that.
“After that, without a longer term appropriation from the federal government, DOT’s ability to contract and pay its contractors significantly reduces,” Figueroa said.

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Providence Place mall’s penthouse movie theater is poised for a remake under a new lease agreement that could start as soon as Nov. 1, pending court approval.
Mark Russo, the court-appointed receiver for the downtown shopping center, announced plans to bring in Apple Cinemas to operate the movie theater in a press release Thursday. Russo also filed a petition in Providence County Superior Court the same day, seeking permission from Judge Brian Stern to finalize the new lease agreement with the regional movie theater operator.
“This represents an important step forward for Providence Place and its future,” Russo said in a statement. “We’re pleased to have reached an agreement with Apple Cinemas — an experienced and growing regional operator — and we’re confident this will bring new energy and an enhanced movie-going experience to the mall.”
The proposed lease, which has already been signed by Russo and by Apple, according to court documents, comes just before the departure of the existing movie theater operator, Showcase Cinemas, owned by National Amusements. Showcase was set to end its 23-year run in Providence on Jan. 31, but Russo sought to cut ties early and find a new movie theater operator.
Stern approved Russo’s request to end the existing contract with Showcase on Thursday, according to court documents.
Showcase did not respond to inquiries for comment Friday. However, its website notes that it will cease operations at Providence Place on Oct. 26 “due to a business decision.”
The 128,000-square-foot cinema contributed nearly 10% of the mall’s annual rent in 2024 — the second-largest source of income after Boscov’s — making its occupancy critical to the mall’s financial future. The shopping center has struggled to stay afloat amid shifts in shopping habits and the loss of flagship stores, culminating in receivership — the state-level equivalent of bankruptcy — in October 2024. The receivership was prompted by a lawsuit from a group of private lenders who alleged they were owed $259 million from a 2011 mortgage loan taken out by the mall owner, Brookfield Properties.
Since taking over the operations and finances, Russo has brought in a new management company, added security and authorized major infrastructure repairs, while also securing court permission to list the property for sale. A listing was slated to hit the market in September, but as of Friday, the property has not been publicly advertised online.
Sarah Dell, a spokesperson for Russo, said in an email Friday that the process to prepare the property for sale has begun, but that a few “procedural and operational matters” still needed to be completed.
“These steps are typical in a court-supervised process, and reflects the commitment to maximizing the property’s value and ensuring a smooth sale process,” Dell said.
Russo also touted the new lease with Apple Cinemas as part of larger efforts to rejuvenate the mall.
“This is part of our broader effort to position Providence Place for long-term success by taking advantage of opportunities that add appeal and value for visitors, other tenants, and the community,” Russo said. 
According to court filings, Apple Cinemas was one of several movie theater operators that expressed interest in taking over the Providence Place movie theater. The number of other offers, and the identities of the companies, was not disclosed.
However, Russo wrote in the court petition that Apple Cinemas’ offer had the best terms and conditions, and that he was “impressed” by the company’s operations at the 10-screen theater next to the Warwick Mall.
Apple Cinemas did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday. A copy of the lease was submitted to Stern for review, but not available for public view.
A court hearing on Russo’s motion for the new lease with Apple Cinemas has been scheduled for Monday, Oct. 20, at 10 a.m., according to the public docket. If approved, Apple could take over operations on Nov. 1, with plans for an “upgraded movie-going experience” in its “signature format,” according to the press release. Details will not be shared until after court approval.
The 1.4-million-square-foot shopping center opened in 1999 after a series of delays and changes to financing and development terms. The final funding package for the $460 million project featured a state bond and a tax treaty with the city of Providence. The state deal used mall sales tax revenue to repay the debt on the bond that paid for construction. The state made its final $73 million payment on the bond in 2019.
The 30-year tax treaty with the city of Providence is set to end in 2028. Under the current agreement, the mall pays $500,000 a year in city property taxes. If taxed at fiscal 2026 city commercial rates, the property would be paying nearly $21.4 million in taxes based on its 2025 assessed value of $730.8 million.
A change in movie theater tenant does not affect the property’s tax payment to the city.

(Photo by Steve Hockstein/HarvardStudio.com)A man whose criminal case helped redefine juvenile justice in New Jersey left prison Friday after nearly 26 years behind bars, a release civil rights advocates celebrated as an affirmation of their decade-long fight against extreme prison sentences for minors.
James Comer was 17 when he was sentenced in 2003 to 75 years behind bars — with no possibility of parole for 68 years — for a deadly 2000 robbery spree in Newark in which he was an accomplice but not the triggerman.
He successfully appealed, with the state Supreme Court decreeing in 2022 that juveniles shouldn’t face the same mandatory sentences adults face, that judges must weigh immaturity and other “hallmark features” of youth in setting punishment, and that minors condemned to lengthy sentences can petition for sentencing review after 20 years.
Since then, such sentencing reviews have become known as “Comer hearings,” and Comer had his own Comer hearing not long after his 2022 landmark win, with a judge reducing his sentence to 25 1/2 years.
Under his original sentence, he wouldn’t have been eligible for parole until 2069, at 86 years old. Instead, at age 42, he walked out of Northern State Prison in Newark Friday, meeting a joyful group of attorneys and other supporters who waited for him outside.
“It means the world to me to have the opportunity to rejoin my loved ones,” he said. “I am forever grateful for this second chance and relieved that no child will face the hopelessness that I endured when I was effectively sentenced to die in prison.”

Attorney Alexander Shalom, who represented Comer for years, said his case demonstrates the importance of second chances, especially for young people.
“James’ resilience and unwavering belief in positive change have forever advanced youth justice in New Jersey,” Shalom said.
Nationally, the U.S. Supreme Court has drastically limited extreme sentences for law-breaking minors in a series of rulings dating back to 2005, in which they barred judges from sentencing people under 18 to the death penalty, life without parole in non-homicide cases, and mandatory life terms in homicide cases, with exceptions for “permanent incorrigibility.”
In New Jersey, the state Supreme Court’s Comer ruling came after years of court fights and legislative advocacy. Since 2022, nearly 100 people condemned to lengthy terms behind bars for offenses they committed as children have successfully petitioned New Jersey courts for Comer hearings, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey.
Amol Sinha, the group’s executive director, said Comer’s case is “part of a bigger story of decarceration in New Jersey” and a racial justice victory in a state with some of the highest racial disparities in its prisons in the nation.
His release comes after the Christie administration ended cash bail in 2014 and the Murphy administration signed a law in 2020 allowing early releases during public health emergencies. It also comes after Gov. Phil Murphy launched a clemency effort in 2024 that has seen him pardon or commute the sentences of 170 people — more clemencies than New Jersey governors have done in the past 30 years combined. Such efforts have cut New Jersey’s prison population, now about 13,000, by about half since 2011.
“James’ story is yet another story where New Jersey can claim leadership of being one of the most forward-thinking states when it comes to decarceration and justice,” Sinha said. “He was effectively sentenced to die in prison. Because of his persistence and his fight, now dozens of people across New Jersey are able to face a more just juvenile justice system.”

(File/Mint Images/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — A transgender student in Berkeley County dropped his appeals in a lawsuit over public school bathrooms after switching to virtual learning, one of his attorneys said Friday.
The high school freshman, who is unnamed in court filings, filed suit in November 2024, claiming a clause in the state budget violates the Constitution’s equal protection clause and federal law prohibiting discrimination. The budget rule puts school districts at risk of losing 25% of their state aid if they let transgender students use multi-occupancy bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity.
The underlying case will continue, the student’s attorney said.
However, the case is on pause until the U.S. Supreme Court hands down a decision in a lawsuit challenging a 2021 West Virginia law that bans transgender students from playing on girls’ and women’s teams in public K-12 schools and colleges. South Carolina passed a similar law in 2022. The nation’s high court agreed July 3 to hear the West Virginia case.
Transgender student can continue using boys’ bathroom, US Supreme Court says

Part of the Berkeley County student’s appeal challenged that pause. The appeal also asked the court to suspend the law while the case proceeds.
The student, referred to in court documents as John Doe, was allowed to use the bathroom of his choice while the appeal made its way through the courts following a U.S. Supreme Court order last month. That decision applied only to that student and acted as a temporary stopgap until judges handed down a decision on the appeal itself.
The student no longer needed that decision made after switching to virtual learning this month “because of discrimination based on his gender identity, including harassment from school staff and peers,” said Alexandra Brodsky, an attorney for Public Justice, which is representing the student.
“Our client’s experience at school is, unfortunately, not unique,” Brodsky said in a statement. “Transphobic harassment is rampant in many South Carolina public schools. And it is spurred by discriminatory laws like the proviso, which feed baseless stereotypes about, and hostility toward, transgender people.”
Directives in the state budget are technically called provisos, and they carry the same legal weight as permanent state law.
A spokeswoman for Berkeley County School District did not respond to a call or email requesting comment.
Attorney General Alan Wilson declared victory, emphasizing that the law remains in effect.
“This is a major win for common sense and for South Carolina families,” Wilson said in a statement.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bathroom-stalls-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-17 14:57:59.771360

The program began this week with the first in a series of collaborative workshop sessions.
The fellowship seeks to support whole newsrooms — rather than focusing on individual reporters — in reporting on the science of climate and environmental change. It will provide training and resources for producing “long-term, accurate, equitable, and impactful coverage” for the communities served by each newsroom, according to an announcement. 
“The communities we cover have already experienced climate-related events, and that’s not going away. This fellowship is an excellent opportunity to better understand what our audience needs and make that information accessible,” said CT Mirror Executive Editor Elizabeth Hamilton.
The institute, based in the URI College of the Environment and Life Sciences, is a collaborative endeavor between higher education, government, nonprofit, business and community leaders and newsrooms to “improve and expand news coverage of environmental topics.”
This year’s cohort is the Metcalf Institute’s second, and includes newsrooms ranging in size, representing all six states in New England. The participating newsrooms are:

Beacon Media 
Connecticut Mirror
Daily Hampshire Gazette 
The New Bedford Light 
New Hampshire Public Radio 
The Providence Eye 
Vermont Community Newspaper Group
WBZ | CBS Boston
WERU Community Radio
The West End News

This fall, participating journalists will engage in training sessions. Early next year, Metcalf Institute leaders will coach the newsrooms through a project they develop and implement. 
John Moritz, CT Mirror’s energy and environment reporter, led the effort to apply for the fellowship. “This is an opportunity for everyone at the CT Mirror — regardless of our individual beats — to explore how climate is impacting the people and topics we cover,” he said. “In addition, Metcalf’s collaborative sessions will allow us to meet with skilled reporters in other newsrooms to learn how they are approaching climate-related stories around New England.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Climate-Ready-Newsrooms-2026.png,,,2025-10-17 14:57:59.771360

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A state agency that regulates the ethical behavior of candidates and politicians filed suit Thursday against Rep. Ajay Pittman.
The suit was filed by the Oklahoma Ethics Commission in Oklahoma County District Court. The Attorney General’s Office confirmed it is also investigating Pittman, D-Oklahoma City.
The Ethics Commission lawsuit alleges Pittman committed fraud and breach of contract by filing fake documents to settle a previous ethics investigation. It seeks actual and punitive damages, costs and attorney fees.
In 2024, Pittman entered a settlement agreement with the Ethics Commission. She admitted using her campaign account to pay expenses not related to her office or campaign.
She admitted to inaccurate reporting of $30,000 in contributions in 2020 and another $20,000 in 2022, in violation of ethics rules.
She also failed to maintain 2020 and 2022 campaign records, also in violation of ethics rules.
She agreed to pay $35,000, which included reimbursements to her campaign and a civil penalty.
Prior to the agreement, she submitted a falsified letter from a building manager indicating her campaign records had been destroyed due to water damage, the Ethics Commission lawsuit alleged.
The suit alleges the letter was written by her mother, former lawmaker Anastasia Pittman, not the building manager, two minutes before it was submitted to the Ethics Commission to induce it to accept her settlement offer.
In addition, the suit alleges Pittman submitted a falsified check to the agency as proof she had made a payment from her personal funds as outlined in the settlement agreement.
Pittman’s “submission of falsified documents to the Ethics Commission was intentional, malicious, and in reckless disregard of the Commission’s enforcement authority and statutory duties,” the suit said.
As a result, the agency suffered damages in the form of the unpaid settlement amount, administrative costs and attorney fees.
The suit alleges she is in breach of the settlement agreement.
Pittman, who was elected to her fourth term in 2024, did not return phone calls seeking comment.
“The Ethics Commission has conducted a thorough review of the scenario surrounding Campaign Finance violations and Breach of Settlement by Representative Pittman and are ensuring the appropriate steps are taken to hold an elected official responsible and provide transparency to the citizens of Oklahoma,” said Executive Director Lee Anne Bruce Boone.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said it was inappropriate, in light of the Ethics Commission’s actions, for Pittman to continue to serve in a role overseeing state-tribal relations and removed her from a related committee where she served as vice chairman. She remains a member of other committees.
The Oklahoma Attorney General’s office on Thursday served a search warrant on her Capitol office, as reported by NonDoc. 
The agency operates the multi-county grand jury.
A spokeswoman confirmed an ongoing investigation, adding that that search warrant was filed under seal.

(Photo courtesy of Getty Images)Allegations that Centreville High School staff coerced minors into getting abortions and assisted them in undergoing the procedure without their parents’ knowledge are “likely untrue,” Oct. 16 findings from Fairfax County Public School’s legal probe surmised. 
The legal probe runs parallel to a separate, ongoing Virginia State Police investigation launched at the request of Gov. Glenn Youngkin after a conservative blogger reported in August that a FCPS teacher named Zaneida Perez alleged another staff member had helped students obtain abortions in 2021. The blogger has family ties to Youngkin but he said it didn’t influence his investigation.
Fairfax abortion allegations fuel new political firestorm in Virginia governor’s race

Under Virginia law, it is illegal for minors to get surgeries, like abortions, unless they have parental consent or a successful petition to a court. Such court records are also exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. 
In the FCPS allegations case, emails between the accused staffer, a social worker, and Centreville’s former principal purport that “proper protocol” was followed concerning pregnant students, who were referred to a school nurse. The school nurse was employed by the local health department rather than the school division, and was legally allowed to discuss reproductive health care options with students. 
The documents released by King & Spaulding, the law firm FCPS hired, stem from their investigation into the abortion allegations and are part of a U.S. Department of Education request that required documentation regarding the matter. 
While the school division’s law firm said they have been unable to locate the former student who allegedly obtained an abortion, a letter purportedly written by the student that was referenced in the blogger’s report may have actually been written by Perez. That’s due to a “high similarity” in the handwriting of the supposed student letter and other complaints filed by Perez, the legal counsel said. 
The lawyers also recently spoke with a student that Perez claimed had been pressured to have an abortion, but the student said as recently as Oct. 9 this year that it was the school nurse she consulted, not the accused social worker, and that high school staff have been supportive of her decision to continue her pregnancy and give birth. 
The newly-released documents also suggest that Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares and Youngkin may have known about the allegations for more than a year, but have only spoken out about them in recent months, ahead of this fall’s pivotal statewide elections. 
The documents include a complaint about the abortion allegations from March 2023 that Perez filed with the attorney general’s office, which FCPS claims they were never contacted about. 
While the state attorney general office doesn’t have the local jurisdiction to prosecute the local complaint from Perez, the filing noted how a referral to state police could have been made in 2023. 
“OAG’s Office of Civil Rights has no record of a complaint filed by Ms. Perez,” a spokesperson for Miayres’ office said in a Oct. 17 email. 
A spokesman for Youngkin said in an October email that the governor learned of the allegations following the August report, after which he had directed state police to launch a criminal investigation. 
The filing from FCPS’ lawyers’ probe also pointed to social media posts by a Northern Virginia parental rights activist that claim the Youngkin administration knew about the allegations “a year ago.”
In the new filings from their law firm, FCPS collectively shared that it finds it “very disturbing that so many of the individuals who are now (in the weeks leading up to a hotly contested election) shining a spotlight on these dated (and, our investigation shows, likely false) allegations have known about these same allegations for years.”
Walter Curt, the investigative reporter who published the August report about the abortion allegations, cast doubt on the law firm’s findings and took to social media to emphasize that a state police investigation is still underway.  
“We don’t have to give even a remote bit of credibility to the ‘findings’ of multimillion dollar law firms hired to try and get FCPS and Michelle Reid out of hot water,” he wrote on Oct. 17. 
FCPS Superintendent Michelle Reid has been under fire from parents along with state and federal leaders much of the year for various decisions, including overhauling admissions  at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology to promote greater diversity, and resisting statewide transgender policies that advocates said infringe on trans students’ rights. By mid-August, the district had begun arranging a security detail for Reid.
Fairfax will hire security for its superintendent. Could Va. see this elsewhere?

Reid is also not the only local official to draw ire from Virginia’s executive branch. Steve Descano, Fairfax County’s Commonwealth Attorney, has been frequently portrayed by Miyares as too lenient a prosecutor. As attorney general, Miyares has long pushed for changes in state law that could allow the state to intervene in local prosecutions. 
The abortion allegations have percolated ahead of this year’s elections for the state’s executive branch —  Miyares is seeking a second term — and as the entire House of Delegates is also up for election. An in-progress constitutional amendment could enshrine reproductive rights including abortion access, but its potential to advance to voters on statewide ballots next year hinges on Democrats retaining their majority in the House this year. 
Reid issued a statement to Centreville families and staff on Oct. 16, echoing the attorney’s findings that so far indicate the abortion allegations are “likely untrue.”
“As I stated in a letter to the school community two days following these allegations, such behavior would never be acceptable in Fairfax County Public Schools,” Reid wrote.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said official negotiations with Republicans to end the federal government shutdown aren’t occurring in Washington right now, only backdoor communications.
“There are a lot of people on both sides of the aisle who are talking about how can we end this and get government operating again and how do we address the health care issue,” she said in an interview with the Bulletin after a roundtable event in Concord. “But nothing official is happening, and again, that’s the problem. We need leadership on both sides of the aisle in both houses and the president to come to the table and help do official negotiations so we can end this.”
The federal government ceased nonessential operations earlier this month after the Senate failed to pass a spending plan. Senate Republicans proposed keeping funding largely at current levels, but Democrats refused to vote for any package that didn’t extend a set of soon-to-expire tax credits used by Americans to purchase health coverage on the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. The Democrats countered with a spending plan that spent roughly $1 trillion more to extend the subsidies and reverse many of the health spending cuts made by Republicans in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July. The sides failed to reach an agreement by Oct. 1, prompting the government shutdown. Both parties have blamed one another for the shutdown.
“The impasse is that, on the one hand, we’re hearing from the majority (Republicans) in both houses and the president saying, ‘We’re not going to talk about the Affordable Care Act premium tax credits as long as the government is shut down,’” Shaheen, a Democrat, said. “And on the other side, we’re saying, ‘Look, we think this needs to be done. There’s urgency. We need to get it done, so let’s do it as part of opening the government.’”
If the shutdown doesn’t end by Oct. 31, the federal government won’t provide New Hampshire with the funding to operate the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides low-income families with help purchasing food. Shaheen wouldn’t say whether she’d vote to end the shutdown if Republicans haven’t agreed to extend the tax credits by then. She pointed the finger at Republicans.
“I think you need to ask Republicans why they continue to shut down the government,” Shaheen said. “Why they’re not willing to address the people who are going to lose their health insurance because of losing their premium tax credits. There’s an easy fix here, and people ought to be willing to come to the table and do both.”
As part of that government shutdown, many federal workers have been furloughed or are being asked to work without pay. Asked how she squares the pain of those federal workers with the pain she’s trying to prevent among Americans who will lose their tax credits, Shaheen said “I think we can do both (end the shutdown and renew the tax credits).”
“Listen, we’re spending $20 billion to bail out Argentina,” she said, referring to the Trump administration’s decision to send aid to the South American country amid increasing inflation under libertarian President Javier Milei. “This administration is willing to bail out Argentina, but they’re going to let 20 million people’s premiums rise so that they can’t afford their health insurance.”
Shaheen emphasized her desire to renew the tax credits. In New Hampshire, just under 50,000 people used the tax credit in 2025, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data. If the credits expire, premiums are set to spike. A single person in their mid-40s earning $31,300 in New Hampshire annually could see their total annual premiums increase $1,344, according to analysis from New Futures, which hosted the roundtable Friday, and Families USA; additionally, a couple in their 60s earning $90,000 annually could see their premiums increase $14,712.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shaheenshutdown-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-17 14:03:29.301808

The Lafayette County Board of Supervisors will decide whether to approve the change on Monday. The county’s planning commission voted 3-1 last month to move forward with the proposal. 
Residents have come together over concerns about the precedent the rezoning would set, potential air emissions and water run off, and how the plant would affect the bucolic nature of the town of about 300 people.
“We’re worried about pollution and how it’ll affect our health,” said Melissa Roberson, a Taylor resident.
The September planning commission meeting saw a large turnout, with most voicing objections to the plant proposal. Many came in support of Falkner Farms, a grass-fed beef and egg producer that supplies markets in the area. 
The family-owned farm sits across a two-lane highway from the proposed asphalt site. Reed Falkner, whose parents bought the land in 1996 to raise their family, is worried the plant would disturb their business. Too much noise, for instance, could cause chickens to produce fewer eggs, he said.

“There’s the potential to put us out of business,” Falkner said. “ This decision (from the county) has a lot of weight. It’s sending a much larger message than asphalt over agriculture. It’s the precedent they’re setting.”
J.W. McCurdy, the developer and owner of the land where the asphalt plant will be built, has lived in Lafayette County since he was 3 years old. 
“I’ve lived here virtually my entire life,” McCurdy said. “I care about the success of Lafayette County as much as anybody in the world. I mean, I’m probably going to die here.”
Between new subdivisions and paving roads, the county has a high demand for asphalt, Joel Hollowell, the county’s director of development services, said. He also pointed to an upcoming project, starting in March, to add new lanes to parts of Mississippi Highway 7.
“We’ve survived a lot of years without competition (in the asphalt market),” Hollowell said. “Could we survive longer? Probably so, but competition tends to create a more affordable product.”
McCurdy and other local developers said the area has only one asphalt provider, which has long lines and isn’t always open when it’s needed. That’s why a new plant could help make it easier and cheaper to build around Oxford, McCurdy said. 
“ I’m trying to better our community and make things more affordable for people to be able to buy houses, rent houses, build restaurants or whatever it may be,” McCurdy said.
Regarding concerns over emissions and runoff, such as into the nearby Yocona River, Hollowell said the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality would have to approve any water runoff or air emissions before the plant could open. 
In 2022, MDEQ cited McCurdy for violating rules around sediment runoff at a construction site in Oxford. The developer told Mississippi Today the error was quickly fixed, describing it as a “misperformance by a subcontractor.”
For nearby residents, though, the decision before the county isn’t just about the asphalt plant. It’s about preserving the area’s identity in the face of growing development and constant expansion around Oxford. Especially amid local struggles with rising housing costs, as The Daily Mississippian wrote about a year ago.
“This kind of fight is a familiar growing pain in counties that are transitioning from rural to suburban,” said Ellen Meacham, a longtime resident of Taylor who saw similar fights in DeSoto County during the late 1990s.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/16123324/IMG_1690.jpg,,,2025-10-17 14:03:29.301808

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)New reporting on controversial comments made by Graham Platner in years past is drawing scrutiny to the Democratic U.S. Senate candidate, who has generated significant grassroots excitement since his campaign launch in August.
While the oyster farmer and veteran has been gaining support with his frank speech, the posts reveal a potential vulnerability for the political newcomer as he goes up against seasoned campaigners with national backing.
The comments were reported by national outlets days after Maine Gov. Janet Mills, the favorite of Democratic Party leaders, entered the race to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins.
On Wednesday, CNN reported on several now-deleted Reddit posts made by Platner in 2020. In one, the Hancock County native responded to a thread titled “white people aren’t as racist or stupid as Trump thinks.” He wrote, “Living in white rural America, I’m afraid to tell you they actually are.”
In another, he described himself as “a vegetable growing, psychedelics taking socialist these days.” 
Platner, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and has been open about his depression after returning home in 2018, wrote, “After the war, I’ve pretty much stopped believing in any of the patriotic nonsense that got me there in the first place, and am a firm believer that the best thing a person can do is help their neighbors and live a loving life.”
His campaign did not respond to a request for comment, but told other outlets he largely regretted the remarks.
“I didn’t feel connected. I didn’t feel like I understood my place in the world, my place in our society. And that of course resulted in a lot of feelings of alienation and loneliness,” he told Maine Public in response to the reporting. “And that’s when all this happened.” 
Politico followed Thursday with reporting on several 2018 posts made by Platner also on Reddit forums highlighting his belief that violence may be necessary to counter facism. 
Responding to another user concerned about what their roommate would say if they purchased their first AR-15, Platner reportedly replied: “Tell them that if they expect to fight fascism without a good semi-automatic rifle, they ought to do some reading of history.”
In another post, Platner said he agreed with the views of former socialist presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs, writing, “An armed working class is a requirement for economic justice.”
A primary focus of Platner’s campaign has been to return the Democratic Party to one of and for working people, while building a lasting structure in Maine for grassroots organizing. He has also been a vocal critic of establishment politicians, including Mills and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who reportedly recruited the Maine governor to enter the race.
“I made dumb jokes and picked fights,” Platner told Politico. “But of course I’m not a socialist. I’m a small business owner, a Marine Corps veteran, and a retired shitposter.”
Before the revelations, political scientist and writer Amy Fried made the argument that a contested primary would be helpful to sharpen Platner’s skills “in a real campaign environment.”
“If there’s anything we know about how Susan Collins runs for the Senate, it’s that her staff is aggressive and tenacious,” Fried wrote on her Substack. “One of its core strategies is to find a weakness in her opponent and hammer them persistently so it sticks in the minds of Maine voters.”

(Photo courtesy of Idaho Education News)This story was originally posted on IdahoEdNews.org on Oct. 15, 2025.
Jerome Joint School District trustees this month will consider adopting a policy that removes a long-standing prohibition on audio and visual recordings during public school board meetings.
School district staff on Aug. 26 told a local television reporter and newspaper reporter that it is against district policy to record a school board meeting. Superintendent Brent Johnson said he consulted with legal counsel the next morning, then called KMVT and the Twin Falls Times-News to say that policy needs to be amended. Trustees took a first reading of the updated policy on Sept. 23 and are expected to adopt the policy on Oct. 28.
“We needed to update that,” Johnson told EdNews on Monday. “That hadn’t been our practice and certainly isn’t our practice moving forward. So we want it to be open.”
While the new policy will allow attendees to record meetings, the district is not following a growing trend of other districts that provide patrons the opportunity to watch meetings from home as they happen, or days later. Jerome provides live audio via a Zoom link in meeting agendas, but does not record that audio for later listening.
About 30% of Idaho school districts and charters provide livestreams of meetings, an EdNews review found this week, a 10% increase from two years ago. More districts started livestreaming meetings during the COVID-19 pandemic when social distancing was necessary.
Jerome has had a policy on the books since 2006 that regulates conduct at open meetings. The policy broadly prohibits the public from using audio recording devices, cameras and video equipment during school board meetings. The board may allow the public to take photos and videos, however, when it “would be desirable” for the board, such as when the district presents awards or swears in new trustees.
A blanket ban on video and audio recording is beyond unreasonable, according to the Idaho Press Club, and violates the media’s constitutionally protected rights to cover government entities.
“We believe that your policy regarding video and audio recording violates Idaho’s open government laws, previous court rulings, and the First Amendment,” President Melissa Davlin wrote in a Sept. 2 letter to Jerome trustees.
READ: Idaho Press Club letter
The 19-year-old policy provides several explanations for the prohibition. It states audio recorders are “easily tampered with” and those tampered recordings might embarrass trustees. If the public is allowed to record meetings, then there must be an official recording prepared by the district “to secure the sanctity of the record.” High quality recording equipment is expensive, the policy adds.
“Fears of embarrassment or saying something inarticulate, as cited in section 5-a of your policy, do not trump the First Amendment,” Davlin wrote in the Sept. 2 letter.
The new policy simply crosses out the entire old policy and adds a section called, “Board Meeting News Coverage.”
“One of the paramount responsibilities of the Board of Trustees is to keep the public informed of its actions,” the new policy states. “Consequently, local news media representatives shall be welcome and encouraged to attend all regular and special meetings of the Board.”
READ: Jerome revised media policy
Audio, photo and video recordings are allowed at all meetings open to the public under the new policy. Camera operators must limit disruption and cannot obstruct the view between the audience and trustees.
Johnson, who was hired in July 2024, said the district consulted with the Idaho School Boards Association and used its model policy.
“We try and stay within their model policies as they’ve been legally approved and consulted with a team of attorneys,” he said.
In a written statement to EdNews on Tuesday, Davlin said she is pleased to see the proposed policy welcomes recording of public meetings.
“I hope the board officially adopts it, and that both the public and local media continue to attend these meetings,” Davlin wrote.
 How other school districts handle recordings

Idaho law does not require school districts to livestream or record meetings, but does require written minutes within a “reasonable time.” There is a wide variety in how Idaho school districts allow the public to follow along if they can’t attend a meeting in person.
An EdNews review this week of school district and charter school websites found 57 of 192, about 30%, livestream board meetings. That’s a 10% increase over the past two years. An EdNews review in 2023 found 39 of 186 districts and charters livestream meetings.
The review this week also found four districts post video recordings after meetings, but do not livestream, and three provide audio only.
Currently, the five largest districts in Idaho livestream and archive school board meetings on YouTube. West Ada and Boise school districts have catalogs of recordings going back to 2020. For most meetings in West Ada, many more people watch the videos than attend in person. The videos have hundreds, or sometimes thousands, of views.

Let Idaho Education News know how you follow your local school board meetings when you can’t attend in person. Do you have any concerns with how your district records, or doesn’t record, meetings? Contact reporter Sean Dolan at sean@idahoednews.org.

Vallivue, the sixth largest district, provides a call-in option that provides live audio during meetings. The district does not record meetings, deputy board clerk Jenny Titus confirmed. She said there haven’t been a lot requests for video recordings from patrons who can’t attend. The number of people who call during the meetings varies from month to month.
“Sometimes we have as little as five callers, sometimes we have up to 25 or 30,” Titus said. “It kind of depends on what’s going on and what’s on the agenda.”
Twin Falls School District livestreams meetings on YouTube, but does not record or archive them for later. The livestreams are provided as a courtesy, according to district spokesperson Eva Craner. If the district recorded meetings, those recordings would become an official record and the meetings would have to stop if the recording fails. Those records would also have to be maintained permanently, Craner said, and the district would likely have to purchase more servers and cloud storage solutions.
“With roughly 42 hours of meetings a year, conservatively, that storage could become costly quickly,” Craner wrote in an email to EdNews.
YouTube will store videos, Craner added, but that is part of the overall storage the district has available through Google that the district uses to store other documents in the cloud.
In Boise School District, spokesperson Dan Hollar said the district does not pay for storage on YouTube and the meetings would continue if the recording fails. But there are several hours of staffing costs to run the livestreams as well as costs to purchase and maintain equipment. Agendas include a disclaimer:
“As a courtesy, the meeting will be live-streamed and the link will be provided immediately prior to the meeting,” the agendas state. “Please note, if there are technical difficulties, the meeting will continue as scheduled.”

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)A preview of one of the debates anticipated next session came Friday when Maine’s Office of Tax Policy provided state lawmakers with an overview of Gov. Janet Mills’ temporary plan for conforming to federal changes to the tax code.  
On Oct. 1, Mills issued preliminary instructions for how the State Tax Assessor will administer Maine’s 2025 tax returns in light of changes made in the federal GOP spending bill passed this summer. But that’s not the final word on the topic. 
A state law passed last session allows the governor to make temporary adjustments to state tax administration in the case of nonconformity, or a lag between federal tax changes and state rules, which is common. But under that law, any temporary changes must be consistent with legislative intent as reflected in already enacted Maine tax laws.
The governor suggested not adopting a few provisions from the GOP bill: no tax on tips and overtime, allowing business owners to claim a tax deduction equal to 100% of the cost of a qualified property, and an immediate tax deduction for businesses based on qualifying research expenditures. 
This means that Mainers would still pay state taxes on these earnings, but not federal taxes. 
Dan Pittman, associate tax policy council for Maine’s Office of Tax Policy, walked through the specifics during a joint meeting of the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee and Taxation Committee Friday morning. He explained that the governor didn’t feel she had the authority to make a decision on those provisions based on the state law. 
“As the governor has made quite clear, this is not the end of the discussions of any of these topics,” Pittman said. 
Temporary determinations are ultimately contingent on lawmakers enacting  legislation that addresses the federal income tax law changes. 
Kirsten Figueroa, commissioner of the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services, said permanent changes also must be considered as a part of the larger fiscal conversation. 
“It’s just not as easy as, we see that something’s happening at the federal level — should we apply it?” Figueroa said.
Lawmakers are meeting later Friday to discuss state impacts from the ongoing federal government shutdown, as well as changes and cuts to programs and responsibilities shifted from the federal to state government. In light of that, Figueroa said, “We won’t be able to take just the tax implications and tax conformity piece because of the fiscal impact it will have in concert with what are the decisions that we’re going to make about those components as well, again all in spirit of needing to balance our budget.” 
The administration also discussed the need to wait for updated revenue projections expected in December. 
Rep. Kenneth Fredette (R-Newport) questioned why the governor didn’t call a special session to address conformity earlier. 
Those present from the tax office said it was above their pay grade but Appropriations Committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Lewiston) responded, “I would suspect that, given the amount of work that’s going to have to go into making these decisions, a special session one day would not have solved these issues.”
But Rep. Amy Arata (R-New Gloucester) called for a public hearing the first week of November to consider adopting federal tax changes, before the Legislature is slated to start its next session in January. 
Legislative Republicans have already been sharply criticizing the Mills administration for not fully conforming with the federal changes.
“It’s never enough for Maine Democrats. Instead of taking this opportunity to provide much-needed relief to Maine citizens, our Governor has chosen to continue with her unsustainable tax-and-spend mentality,” Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) said in a statement on Oct. 3. “Democrats’ angry obsession with opposing anything President Trump touches is going to continue to hurt Maine people.”
Fredette also questioned Friday that, if Maine doesn’t ultimately comply fully with federal tax changes, if it would essentially amount to tax increases for Mainers. 
Pittman said no. “If the state doesn’t conform or choose to piggyback off of a federal tax cut, your federal state tax isn’t changing. You just don’t get that benefit. There are parts of the Maine tax law that provide tax benefits that the federal government doesn’t provide.” An example: the federal government taxes Social Security benefits. But Maine doesn’t. 
Looking at federal changes holistically, the tax deductions may not be enough to offset the negative effects of other aspects of the Republicans’ spending bill.

Girod, chancellor since 2017, pointed to a series of threats confronting U.S. higher education. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — University of Kansas Chancellor Doug Girod says dismantling of federal funding of university research, lukewarm state budgets, a precipitous drop in college-age students, rise of artificial intelligence and inflationary pressure on operating costs threaten the future of higher education.
These headwinds exist amid dwindling enthusiasm, regardless of political affiliation, in the public’s view of the value of investment in a college degree, the chancellor said. Positive sentiment among Americans for higher education has eroded from 70% to 40% in less than a decade, he said.
“The question of, is the investment worth it, is really the question that’s being asked a lot of our society,” Girod said. “It’s creating a time of fairly significant uncertainty across the country right now.”
Girod said computing power of artificial intelligence would transform KU and other higher education institutions. AI must be viewed as a “disruptor,” he said, but also an opportunity to evolve.
“It’s going to completely change how we educate. It’s going to completely change how we conduct research. It certainly is going to completely change how we conduct our business of higher education,” he said.
Girod shared the report Thursday during his annual “State of the University Address,” which featured a broad analysis of U.S. higher education as well as distinct challenges facing KU and a summary of the university’s enrollment, research and fundraising trends.

Positive trends
Girod said KU this fall achieved record student enrollment for the second consecutive year. The current freshman class at KU is the third largest in university history, he said. At the same time, the chancellor said, KU improved student retention and its graduation rate. The decline in 18-year-olds in the United States will make continuation of that track record increasingly difficult, he said.
“We have the most Kansas kids we’ve ever had. We have the most out-of-state kids we’ve ever had. That’s a great place to be at this moment in time,” he said.
The chancellor said KU documented nine consecutive years of growth in research funding as the total climbed from $337 million in 2017 to $611 million in 2024. The pipeline of research grants in the current year has “slowed down profoundly” as the administration of President Donald Trump rolled back federal research and development funding available to colleges and universities.
He said progress has been made with the “One KU” project to realign and unify administrative leadership of KU campuses in Lawrence, Wichita and Kansas City, Kansas. The idea is to create efficiencies by moving away from a decentralized campus-based administrative structure, he said.
“The goal of that is obviously to help us streamline and be far more strategic, but also far more nimble in leveraging our assets across all our campuses,” Girod said.
Girod told about 200 people during the speech that KU endowment’s fundraising campaign eclipsed the $2 billion mark with two years remaining in a 10-year quest to secure commitments of $2.5 billion. He said half the contributions were destined for KU’s Lawrence campus, 30% would be dedicated to KUMC and 20% was earmarked for athletics.
“I’m happy to stand up here and say the state of our university is actually quite strong,” Girod said. “Probably the strongest it’s ever been. I also know I say that in a moment when we probably have the highest degree of uncertainty that we’ve had … in the history of the university.”
 
Kansas headwinds
Girod said the 2025 Kansas Legislature adopted a flat budget in terms of base support for KU, which could be viewed as a step backward due to inflation. He said a 30% surge in operating costs in the past five years and combined challenges with state and federal funding prompted decisions to cut spending by $32 million on the Lawrence campus and to reduce spending by $39 million on the KU Medical Center campus in Kansas City, Kansas.
“I’ll tell you on the Lawrence campus about half of that cut will go to market pay for faculty and staff, but that really just gets us started on that journey,” Girod said.
David Smith, a professor of sociology, was among faculty and staff in the audience holding small signs during the chancellor’s speech that said “Contract now! Stop the delay” or “Fair contract now!” KU faculty and academic staff in April 2024 approved formation of a union by capturing 86% of the vote among nearly 1,000 participants in the election. The bargaining unit, United Academics of KU, represents employees with educational or research roles on campus.
“We have been in contract negotiations for well over a year now,” Smith said. “It’s been something like 450 days since those contract negotiations began.”
Smith said union negotiators were working to improve compensation, especially for adjunct faculty or people on short-term contracts. He said negotiations included an effort to enshrine in the first contract guarantees the administration formally shared governance with faculty and staff. For example, he said, union membership should have had a concrete role in discussing with KU administrators the 42 academic programs that were unilaterally discontinued in 2022.
Girod said the 2026 session of the Legislature would be important to KU, and early indications were that it would be another tight budget year for higher education. He anticipated legislators would renew a push to redefine university tenure so it no longer could be recognized as an “entitlement, right or property interest.” The 2025 version of that legislation was blocked by opponents, including Girod, from emerging from a House committee.
“We’ve already been told its coming back again. We know that’s something we’re going to have to pay attention to because it’s so critical to what we do and who we are as an institution,” the chancellor said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Doug-Girod-speech-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-17 14:03:29.301808

(Photo from Canva)Louisiana officials increased the construction budget this week for a new 80-bed regional jail dedicated exclusively to 17-year-olds. 
The facility is being built after state lawmakers approved a law in 2024 that requires 17-year-olds to be treated as adults, rather than minors, in the criminal justice system. The change Gov. Jeff Landry pushed has created a space crunch in some local jails. 

The state Criminal Justice Priority Commission originally awarded Concordia Parish Sheriff David Hedrick $3 million earlier this year to convert an old community center into a jail for 17-year-olds. The commission upped the project budget to $3.5 million Thursday after Hedrick’s office said project bids came in higher than expected. 
The facility will accommodate 17-year-olds from East Baton Rouge, Lafayette, LaSalle, Livingston, Madison, Tensas, West Carroll, West Feliciana, Winn and possibly other parishes, according to the project application submitted last year. 

State budget officials had not initially recommended the Concordia facility receive funding, but legislators and the governor’s staff inserted it into the list of approved projects earlier this year to address concerns from sheriffs about needing space to house more 17-year-olds.

The decision to treat 17 year-olds as adults conflicts with federal law and has created logistical problems for Louisiana sheriffs at their local jails. The federal government prohibits 17-year-olds from being housed with adults and requires sheriffs to provide the teens with educational resources while they are jailed. 
Sheriffs have complained they don’t have the space or funding for these accommodations. This Concordia facility devoted exclusively to 17-year-olds is supposed to help alleviate that pressure.

From maintaining funds for free school meals and continued financial support for innovative programs like RxKids, it is easy to find successes in this year’s budget negotiations.
Yet, as the CEO of a provider of services for survivors of violence, I am deeply troubled by this budget’s failure to meet the needs of victims of violence and some of our most vulnerable neighbors. For decades, federal and state funds have been the primary source of funding for victim services across the country, including in Michigan. Funding these services has been part of the government’s commitment to public safety.
Recently, this definition of “public safety” has narrowly shifted to policing and law enforcement, leaving behind the actual victims who depend on emergency shelter, legal support, housing, forensic exams, and other services necessary to escape violence and engage with law enforcement in the first place.
Since 2018, federal funding streams for survivors of violence have decreased dramatically, with another projected decrease in 2026. In addition to this downward trend, the swift policy and funding changes of the new federal administration have decimated funds for victims, particularly survivors of human trafficking.
So we, and many advocates, turned to the state for support. We engaged with many supportive legislators and completed all required steps in alignment with a newly announced “transparent” budget process. We, and many advocates, drafted testimonies. We came prepared with stories to tell and data to highlight client successes, program efficiencies, and even how our programs save state funds. Yet, no committee hearing was held. Few updates were shared. And we, like many others, found that the budget had been decided overnight.
Just hours into Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we saw deep cuts to MDHHS, few state funding supports, and a 2026 allocation for programs, organizations, and Crime Victims Sustaining Grants covering less than half of the total gap in federal funding loss.
This year’s budget failed to backfill increasing federal declines in funding for victim services – to the tune of $45 million – allowing this loss to hit communities statewide. Reductions in victim services mean reductions in survival. The loss means more violent deaths, particularly of children.
As did our federal leaders, now our own state government has turned its back on the Michiganders at greatest risk for homicide. Public safety does not just mean holding perpetrators accountable. It also means stopping homicide before it happens by giving victims and their children a place to flee and organizations to protect them – and these are the services slashed in communities across the state.
After the passing of this state budget, YWCA Kalamazoo is facing deep budget cuts, severely reducing comprehensive and life-saving interventions. We know hundreds of survivors will now go unserved within the next year in our area, just as the lethality of violence rises. Across Michigan, domestic and sexual violence organizations are facing much the same, if not closing their doors entirely.
Budgets are more than how and where a state spends its money. They are a reflection of the guiding principles and priorities for the state and its elected officials. While there are pieces of this budget that respond to the growing needs and concerns of some Michiganders, it is also true that many needs – many people – remained negotiable.
Expendable.
With Michigan’s 2026 budget decided and no end to the federal government turmoil in sight, community members positioned at the margins will continue to carry the burden. Lawmakers must see our neighbors, particularly women and children, as worthy of protection.
Until then, organizations like YWCA Kalamazoo statewide will host more and more vigils for victims whose lives are needlessly, violently, lost. We hope you’ll attend and light candles for the lives written out of the budget.

Steven Jackson, D-Shreveport,  has asked the Louisiana Board of Ethics to dismiss more than $10,700 in fines he faces for failing to properly submit public disclosure and campaign finance forms over the past two years.","Rep. Steven Jackson sponsored a new law that requires the Louisiana Board of Ethics to broadcast its public meetings. (Allison Allsop/Illuminator)State Rep. Steven Jackson, D-Shreveport,  has asked the Louisiana Board of Ethics to dismiss more than $10,700 in fines he faces for failing to properly submit public disclosure and campaign finance forms over the past two years. 

Jackson, who has also held a local elected seat, has a decade-long history of not filing his election and government transparency paperwork on time and appropriately. 

Since he first ran for the Caddo Parish Commission in 2015, Jackson has been fined by the ethics board 22 times, including the seven existing penalties he is asking to be waived, according to the ethics board staff. 
Jackson told the ethics board in an August email he had recently hired an accountant to handle his campaign finance paperwork and his failure to submit the forms properly was not malicious. 

“In most instances, the reports were submitted, though some contained errors. In the limited cases where a report was not filed, it was due to duplication of information rather than any intent to violate the law,” Jackson wrote to state Ethics Administrator David Bordelon. 
The board staff has recommended the board deny Jackson’s appeal of the penalties and require the legislator to pay the fines. 
Campaign finance reports and personal financial disclosure paperwork are the primary way the public knows who donates to a political campaign and what conflict of interest elected officials might have. When those forms aren’t submitted properly, members of the public are denied the ability to learn about a politician’s donors and personal financial interests. 

The bulk of Jackson’s current round of the ethics penalties, around $7,200, comes from missing deadlines or leaving information off of five reports related to the 2023 election, when he first won his state representative seat. 

Jackson also faces a $2,500 penalty for not including all of his income streams on a personal financial disclosure form he was required to fill out in 2023 as a Caddo Parish commissioner and a member of the Louisiana Housing Corporation Board of Directors. He served in both roles before he became a legislator.  
He has also failed to turn in another campaign finance report listing who gave him political donations and how he spent money from his campaign account for the year of 2024. The report was due Feb. 15 of this year, but Jackson has never submitted it, according to the ethics board staff. 

The state representative has often complained the board is too aggressive about enforcing deadlines.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

He declined to talk to a reporter about his waiver request when reached by telephone this month and instead asked for questions to be sent to an “Elect Steven Jackson” email account. He said questions sent to the email address would be answered by campaign workers, who he refused to identify by name and didn’t sign an emailed statement. 
“Late filings shouldn’t result in excessive fines or aggressive penalties. Rep. Jackson remains committed to fixing a system that punishes paperwork delays more harshly than serious offenses,” reads a statement sent from the email account. 
The state had to resort to extreme measures to collect previous fines from Jackson for forms that weren’t submitted properly during his 2015 and 2018 races for the Caddo Parish Commission.
It filed a short-lived lawsuit on Aug. 15, 2019, to block Jackson from qualifying to run for his second term on the commission over $3,600 in late fees for his 2015 race. State law requires candidates for public office to have paid their penalties in full before they enter a new election cycle. The suit was withdrawn a day later after Jackson hastily met with the board and paid some of the fines he owed. 
Over a separate group of fines, the attorney general’s office garnished more than $1,000 monthly from Jackson’s paychecks for three months in 2022. It covered fines he accrued when he didn’t file paperwork properly during the 2018 election cycle. 
If Jackson doesn’t pay or resolve his latest set of penalties soon, he could face similarly aggressive enforcement methods. Bordelon said in an interview that two of the seven fines Jackson currently owes have already been referred to the attorney general’s office. 
In an email with Bordelon, Jackson argued he should not have to pay at least one of the fines that has already gone to the attorney general, worth $2,500, because of a 2024 law he authored.
Jackson was assessed this particular fine in 2023 because he never filed the required personal financial disclosure form when he ran for state representative. The report, which is due a few days after candidates sign up to run for office, includes information about a candidate’s income, property ownership and business interests for the public to inspect. 
Jackson said that he didn’t think he had to turn it in because he had submitted similar information to the ethics board as a Caddo Parish commissioner a few months earlier. 

The 2024 law Jackson authored, which the Louisiana Legislature approved unanimously, now exempts candidates who are already in elected office, like Jackson, from having to file a second personal financial disclosure form if they have already done so.
But the law isn’t retroactive, and Jackson will still be responsible for the fine unless the board agrees to waive it. 
In previous years, Jackson’s mounting penalties led the state representative to lash out at the ethics staff. Over several email exchanges from 2019-23, Jackson accused the ethics staff of harassing him and treating him unfairly. 
“You all are nothing more than a debt collection agency that harasses and bullies elected officials who don’t have the means to defend themselves,” Jackson wrote as Caddo Parish commissioner in an October 2022 email to former Ethics Administrator Kathleen Allen. 
The board has also struggled to deliver notice of late fees to Jackson via certified mail. Four attempts to get penalty notices to Jackson went unsigned from August of 2024 to March of 2025  alone, according to information provided by the board staff. 

As a result, Bordelon, as the state ethics administrator, decided to personally hand deliver Jackson’s most recent late notices directly to the state representative while Jackson was at the State Capitol on April 23. At the time, Jackson was in Baton Rouge for the state legislative session. 
The ethics board will consider Jackson’s request for fine waivers at its Dec. 5 meeting. The matter was pushed from its October meeting two weeks ago until December in order to accommodate Jackson’s schedule, according to information the board provided.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/LaIllum-01-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-10-17 13:02:51.570385

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)RAPID CITY — A national leader in monetary policy said during a visit to South Dakota that the Federal Reserve was “making good progress” bringing down inflation until “tariffs threw a curveball at us.”
Neel Kashkari, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, addressed dozens of people during a question-and-answer session Thursday at the Hyatt Place in downtown Rapid City. A local economic development group, Elevate Rapid City, hosted the event.
A tariff is a tax on imported goods. Kashkari said the duration and severity of tariff-caused price increases is still unknown.
“The impact of tariffs on the economy is taking longer to be felt than I would have guessed when they were announced,” he said.


That’s partly because some businesses have used their inventories to avoid buying imported goods, which has allowed them to avoid passing the cost of tariffs on to their customers.
“But as that inventory gets worked down, they have to replenish it,” Kashkari said. “They’re telling us, ‘Hey, at the beginning of the year, we might start to see more of a tariff impact on prices.’”
Effects on farmers
Farmers are already feeling the effects of higher tariffs. Responding to a question about China’s retaliatory boycott of U.S. soybean purchases, Kashkari said the situation is changing the global marketplace.
“What’s happening is you’re seeing other countries respond by growing more beans,” he said. “And so more supply is coming online, and that is going to have a permanent effect on the price of soybeans, and it really disrupts our markets.”
He added that “when our whole supply lines are set up to ship to China, it’s not so easy to now turn it around and ship it someplace else.”
Yet he said there’s little the Fed can do for affected farmers: “All we can do is try to keep inflation in check, and it really is a question for our elected leaders and for fiscal policy to try to address.”
Interest rates
Kashkari is a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the target for the influential federal funds interest rate. The Fed has kept the rate higher in recent years while trying to bring inflation down to 2% over the long term.
The Trump administration has publicly pressured the Fed to lower the key interest rate faster. At the same time, the administration has been imposing and threatening higher tariffs on an array of imports from numerous countries.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The measure of annual inflation used by the Fed, the personal consumption expenditures price index, peaked above 7% three years ago and was down to 2.3% this April, but has since risen to 2.7%. Last month, the Fed reduced its key interest rate for the first time this year, lowering its short-term rate from about 4.3% to about 4.1%. Kashkari supported the move and said at the time that two more reductions could be warranted by the end of the year.
On Thursday, he said “I don’t think it’s likely that we’re going to wake up to 4 or 5% inflation,” because the Fed can “do the math” to determine how tariff rates will impact inflation.
“So, I think the risk of inflation is more one of persistence, that it’s not so much of a one-time event, but it stays at 3% for an extended period of time,” Kashkari said.
Other topics
Kashkari spoke about numerous other topics raised by audience members Thursday, including the following.
Politics: Regarding pressure from the Trump administration, Kashkari said that “the best thing we can do when we face political uncertainty is to do our jobs to the best of our ability, leaving politics at the door. And the more we do that and the more we are seen and acknowledged to be doing that, the more credibility I believe we will have with the American people.”
Artificial intelligence: Kashkari said he’s “long-term bullish” on the technology’s potential but “short-term skeptical” about predictions it will cause mass layoffs, because most major new technologies take decades to “get woven into the fabric of society.”
Immigration: The two sources of economic growth are productivity and population growth, Kashkari said, and without the latter, “you’re going to have slower growth unless you decide to embrace immigration. And that’s just math.”
Housing affordability: Home prices will go up if interest rates are cut without more homes being built, Kashkari said, so “localities need to look at what can you do locally to try to remove some of the barriers that are preventing more supply from coming in.”
Consumer outlook: “Consumers keep getting asked questions: ‘How are you feeling about the economy?’” Kashkari said. “And for the last three years, consumers have said, ‘The economy stinks. I’m gloomy as heck.’ And then they go spend thousands of dollars on Taylor Swift tickets, and they get on planes, and they go out to restaurants, and people are spending money like crazy. And so there’s a disconnect between how people are feeling and what they are actually doing.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3072-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-17 13:02:51.570385

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — While the U.S. Department of Education proposes mass layoffs in its special education office, an Oklahoma lawmaker said he intends to bolster state-level support for students with disabilities. 
Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, said he plans to file legislation to give families of special education students an outlet at the state level to seek recourse when their children aren’t receiving the proper services guaranteed to them by law.
Although funding for special education is secure, the federal employees whose jobs could be eliminated are responsible for holding states accountable to upholding the rights of students with disabilities.
“I was hearing from a lot of parents with children with special needs,” said Pugh, who leads two committees on K-12 schools. “I felt like there was a need for us to act on their behalf because what you don’t want is a parent in a situation where they don’t feel like the system is working for them and there’s no recourse when that occurs.”
A key part of his legislation would be to ensure families don’t have to hire an attorney when pursuing complaints through the state, Pugh said. He also aims to set clear timelines to address each case, so parents aren’t dragged into a lengthy “bureaucratic nightmare,” he said.
“I think there’s the assurance from the state to parents that, ‘Hey, we’re not going to let your child’s rights be violated here and then force you to foot the bill to fight that through the legal system,’” Pugh said.
The deadline for lawmakers to file bills before the 2026 legislative session is Jan. 15. 
Lawmakers convene their legislative session Feb. 2. Meanwhile, Pugh also is running as a Republican candidate in the 2026 election for state superintendent.
Last month, the U.S. Department of Education distributed $181 million to Oklahoma for special education through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). That amount covers 14% to 15% of the cost to educate children with disabilities in Oklahoma public schools, Pugh said.

Amid an ongoing government shutdown, the Trump administration attempted sweeping layoffs at multiple federal agencies, including cutting 466 jobs at the U.S. Department of Education. That reduction in force would eliminate almost the entire Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services.
A California federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked the layoffs from moving forward. 
The Oklahoma State Department of Education assured families that federal cuts wouldn’t mean oversight of special education programs would disappear. 
The state agency also monitors these services to make sure local school districts comply with IDEA and state standards, Deputy Superintendent Romel Muex-Pullen wrote in a statewide letter this week.
The state Education Department also offers assistance with dispute resolution, she wrote.
“Despite changes at the federal level, our mission, responsibility, and dedication remain unchanged,” Muex-Pullen wrote. “Oklahoma will continue to ensure that all students with disabilities receive the educational services, protections, and opportunities guaranteed under IDEA.”
One of the primary functions of the U.S. Department of Education is investigating and remediating violations of federal laws like IDEA, often threatening the withholding of federal funds to do so.
During an Aug. 19 visit to Oklahoma, U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said the federal government still would defend students’ civil rights, though she continues to advocate for closing the U.S. Department of Education and limiting federal influence in public schooling.

“If you were a school that receives federal funding and you are not abiding by the law, then clearly we have the authority and we will take that action,” she told Oklahoma Voice during a bill signing ceremony at the state Capitol.
Despite the government shutdown, students are still going to school, teachers are still being paid and schools are still operating as normal, McMahon wrote in a social media post Wednesday. She said that’s evidence the federal Department of Education is “unnecessary.”

Seasonal migration raises concerns for continued infections of a virulent strain of bird flu. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)As hundreds of millions of birds flock south during seasonal autumn migration, so too does a particularly virulent strain of bird flu. New Mexico state officials said they’re keeping an eye on wild bird and mammal deaths as the season progresses, but noted that some tracking efforts have been hampered by the ongoing federal shutdown.
The H5N1 strain of avian influenza has killed millions of birds and mammals worldwide. And while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the current risk to human health is low, experts contend the virus’ propensity to spread from birds to other animals and mutate further raises the prospect for a new pandemic. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture Sept. 30 plan for the shutdown requires the agency to track avian influenza, calling it “essential to protecting public health and safety.” According to an Oct. 14 spreadsheet tracking, dozens of H5N1 cases were documented in the past two weeks across seven states, including wild waterfowl in New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Washington and vultures in Indiana, Kentucky, Utah, West Virginia.
USDA last confirmed a wild bird avian influenza case in New Mexico in March 2025, from a great horned owl in Chaves County. The USDA reported 339 domestic bird H5N1 deaths this year in February through April from flocks in Roosevelt, Curry, Valencia and Bernalillo counties.
Elin Crockett, a wildlife veterinarian for the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, said in a statement provided to Source NM that state officials are collecting samples during investigations of wild bird deaths.
“Our current focus is on monitoring for unusual mortality events, particularly among waterfowl, raptors and scavengers, as fall migration progresses,” Crockett said.
Crockett said interruptions to work at the federal National Wildlife Health Center, Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services during the shutdown have impacted tracking birds in the field and diagnostic tests for the virus.
“Many routine surveillance and response activities are currently limited. Active surveillance on healthy migrating waterfowl that is normally coordinated through federal partners has been paused,” Crockett said.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Sept. 30 plan for the shutdown states the agency will limit the number of staff in laboratories, hatcheries and other facilities, reduce field work or suspend work altogether.
Experts’ concerns extend beyond wild birds or backyard flocks. In 2024, the flu spread to dairy cattle in New Mexico and other states. Sick dairy cows and increased cases in poultry farms facilitated 70 human cases and one death across the U.S., though none reported in New Mexico.
The outbreak in cows has slowed, but ultimately impacted more than 1,000 herds in 18 states. Cases were confirmed in Idaho this month.
New Mexico hasn’t reported a livestock case since May, Samantha Holeck, the state veterinarian with the New Mexico Livestock Board, told Source NM, but officials remain on the lookout.
“I don’t think we’re gonna know about the impact on dairy populations until we get through this migratory season and can see what happens,” Holeck said.
Since 2023, more than 90 New Mexico mammals have contracted the virus, mostly mice collected from infected dairies last year. In 2025, cases included three skunks, all in March, two  in Curry County and one in Valencia County; and one domestic cat in February, in Curry County.
Holeck cautioned that anyone with pet cats or other animals should minimize water sharing outdoors and prevent sickness from exposure to infected birds or carcasses.
“An exposure to that virus is potentially a fatal exposure,” Holeck said. “We want to make sure that people keep close tabs on their animals and maintain a barrier or a safe distance from wild animals.”

(Provided by the SC Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — A death row inmate who killed three people 21 years ago as he taunted police with a message in blood, then beat up an officer after he was jailed, is scheduled for execution Nov. 14, according to a Friday death warrant.
Stephen Bryant, 44, is slated to be the fifth person in the state put to death this year and the seventh total since executions resumed last September following an unintended 13-year hiatus.

Bryant pleaded guilty in 2008 to a number of crimes, including three Sumter County murders, four years prior.
He was sentenced to death for the third murder.
“Victim number four in two weeks, catch me if you can,” he wrote on the wall for police to find, with some of the letters in blood, according to court filings.
Unless a court steps in or the governor grants him clemency, which Gov. Henry McMaster has not done for any other inmate, Bryant will die by his choice of lethal injection, firing squad or electrocution.
The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday turned down his final pending appeal, claiming his mother’s alcohol use while pregnant made him incompetent for execution.
Bryant’s attorneys made a last-ditch attempt to halt his coming death warrant, claiming the shutdown of the U.S. government requires his federal public defenders to work without pay, hindering their ability to file any necessary appeals on his behalf. The state Supreme Court unanimously denied his request in a two-sentence order Friday.
Bryant’s crime spree began with a burglary Oct. 5, according to court records. He committed a second burglary three days later, then shot a fisherman, Clinton Brown, in the back in Richland County. Brown survived the shooting.
On Oct. 9, Bryant picked up his coworker, Cliff Gainey, at his home and took him to a convenience store, then out on a drive. Bryant shot Gainey three times, then left his body on the side of the road and returned to Gainey’s home, which he robbed.
Two days later, Bryant killed 62-year-old Willard Tietjen in his Sumter home. After shooting Tietjen nine times, Bryant ransacked his house looking for items to steal, then smoked cigarettes and a cigar and used Tietjen’s computer.
Bryant answered calls to Tietjen’s phone from his wife and daughter by telling them he had killed Tietjen.
When police arrived at the scene, after Bryant had left, they found cigarette burns on Tietjen’s eyes and several notes left behind, including the bloody message on the wall.
Two days after that, Bryant greeted 35-year-old Chris Burgess at a convenience store. Burgess put his motorcycle in the back of Bryant’s truck and drove off with him, the clerk later recounted. Similar to how he killed Gaines, Bryant shot Burgess twice and left his body on the side of the road, according to court records.
SC death row inmate who killed 3 reaches end of appeals, can receive death warrant

Police caught Bryant, who witnesses had identified, that same day. Bryant confessed to the crimes, according to court filings.
While in jail the following year, Bryant attacked a detention officer, punching him multiple times and continuing to beat him after he collapsed, according to court records. Bryant pleaded guilty to that attack along with the other crimes in 2008.
Bryant received a death sentence for killing Tietjen and life sentences for the other two slayings, plus 100 years combined for his other crimes, according to court records.
Bryant’s defense attorneys said he was high on methamphetamine when he killed Tietjen and that a history of drug abuse to cope with childhood sexual abuse.
In an appeal, his attorneys claimed prosecutors failed to mention that Bryant’s aunt had sexually abused him as a child during the sentencing phase of the trial, which might have affected the judge’s decision to give him the death penalty.
Courts rejected that appeal, alongside all others Bryant has filed.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0542-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-10-17 13:02:51.570385

Announcements

Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Leonard, a former speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives, on Wednesday announced that Nikki Snyder, one of only two GOP members on the Michigan State Board of Education, will serve as chair of his Leonard for Michigan Education Coalition, which would advise the campaign on education priorities.
Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Dr. Abdul El-Sayed‘s campaign announced it was launching a statewide “Open Our Healthcare” tour, starting in Houghton in the Upper Peninsula, on Oct. 22, with later stops in Pontiac, Detroit and Downriver. The events will “convene providers, patients, and community advocates”.

 
Fundraising

State Senator Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo) announced Tuesday that his campaign has raised more than $300,000 in the first full quarter of his campaign to win the Democratic nomination for Michigan’s 4th Congressional District, currently occupied by Republican U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga of Holland Township.
Speaking of which, Huizenga reported having raised just $325,000 in the third quarter, nearly half of which were $158,000 in transfers from House Speaker Mike Johnson’s “Grow the Majority”  joint fundraising committee. However, he ended the quarter with $1.6 million in cash on hand.
Also seeking to replace Huizenga is Kalamazoo attorney Jessica Swartz. The Democrat raised $92,000 in the third quarter with approximately $171,000 in the bank.

 

7th Congressional District candidate Bridget Brink announced Thursday that her campaign for the Democratic nomination had raised $611,179 in the third quarter, leaving her with more than $738,000 cash on hand, “nearly double any other Democratic candidate.”
Meanwhile, her main opponent for the nomination, Matt Maasdam, said on Thursday he had raised more than $615,000 in the third quarter, making him “the top-raising Democratic challenger in Michigan this quarter.”

 

Don Ufford, a former Ford Motor Co. engineer, announced Thursday that his campaign for the Democratic nomination to Michigan’s 11th Congressional District seat had raised “more than $350,000 in just 34 days during the 3rd Quarter, more than any other candidate in the race.”
Meanwhile, state Sen. Jeremy Moss (D-Bloomfield Township), who is also seeking the 11th District Democratic nomination, raised approximately $205,000 for the quarter, ending with almost $472,000 in cash on hand.
The third Democrat seeking that nomination is Sterling Heights attorney Aisha Farooqi, who raised $114,351 and finished with just over $72,000 in cash on hand.

 

The campaign of U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) seeking the Democratic nomination to run in 2026 for Michigan’s U.S. Senate seat noted on Thursday that the $1.9 million it previously reported she raised in the third quarter allowed it to end the period with $2.6 million in the bank, “far outpacing her opponents.”
One of those opponents, Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, announced on Monday his campaign had raised $1.77 million in the third quarter of 2025, and ended the third quarter with more than $1.8 million cash on hand.
The other Dem U.S. Senate candidate, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), previously reported raising more than $1.65 million in the third quarter, with records showing she had just under $1.5 million in cash on hand.
On the GOP side, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake) reported having in excess of $2.7 million in cash on hand in his campaign for the Republican nomination. But as The Detroit News reported, only $1.6 million of that total was raised in the third quarter, while the $2.2 million reported being raised in that span “reflects two transfers on Sept. 19 from his joint-fundraising entity, Team Rogers, of about $626,587 that was raised in the second quarter” as well as “$62,000 from the National Republican Senatorial Committee”.

 



Also of note
Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald, who is running as a Democrat for Michigan Attorney General, on Tuesday called on fellow AG candidates to “uphold the law faithfully and not weaponize it for political gain.”
The challenge came after President Trump‘s Department of Justice filed charges against former FBI Director James Comey following pressure from the White House to prosecute the president’s political rivals, and after Trump, in a social media post, called for both the Mayor of Chicago and Governor of Illinois to be jailed.
McDonald is among four Democrats seeking the AG nomination of their party. The others are: Washtenaw County Prosecutor Eli Savit, former U.S. Attorney Mark Totten, and public defender William Noakes. On the GOP side, there are two announced candidates; Eaton County Prosecutor Doug Lloyd and attorney Kevin Kijewski.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Advance-at-a-glance-political-roundup-v2-1024x662.png,,,2025-10-17 12:04:48.625493

What’s happening in your town?,Sasha Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/17/violent-crime-is-down-across-ct-whats-happening-in-your-town/,"Murders in the state declined nearly 35%, and cases of criminal sexual contact declined nearly 18% from 2023 to 2024.","Serious violent crimes in Connecticut, including murder, manslaughter, assault and rape, dropped from 2023 to 2024 and are at their lowest level since at least 2021, according to the latest data from the state Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection.
Murders in the state declined nearly 35%, and cases of criminal sexual contact declined nearly 18% from 2023 to 2024, according to an Oct. 7 press release from the CT Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, based on data collected by the National Incident-Based Reporting System.
“This police data confirms that public safety trends are continuing to move in the right direction, that Connecticut remains one of the safest states in the country, and that we should keep implementing policies that will reduce the rates of crime even further,’’ said Gov. Ned Lamont in the press release.
This trend continued into the first two quarters of 2025, and when comparing the number of crimes classified as “crimes against persons” this year to the first two quarters of 2024, there was an overall drop in cases.
There was even more of a decline in incidents of theft, robberies and burglaries, shoplifting and larceny, vandalism and all other incidents classified under the National Incident-Based Reporting System as “crimes against property.” Compared to the first two quarters of 2024, there were 19.1% fewer incidents of property crimes, with drops in nearly every category.
This decline follows a spike in property crimes in 2023, where property crimes hit the highest rates seen from 2021 to 2025.
However, from 2024 to 2025, crimes against society, which include drug and weapons violations, increased. This was largely due to an overall increase in drug violations. Weapons violations and pornography and obscene material violations both dropped.
“Group B offenses” include less serious crimes that lead to arrests, including disorderly conduct, trespassing and driving under the influence. These offenses rose 4.3% from 2024 to 2025, with increases in arrests for trespassing incidents and disorderly conduct.
Across the nation, as in Connecticut, violent and property crimes were on the decline in 2024 compared to 2023. According to the Councils of State Governments Justice Center, there was a decrease in violent crime rates in 39 states and D.C. from 2019 to 2024.
While the majority of Connecticut towns saw major drops in crime rates from 2023 to 2024, a few towns saw increases.
Col. Daniel Loughman of the Connecticut State Police attributed the fall in violent crimes to the work of police.
“Our troopers are on the front lines every day, and the progress in these reports belongs to them,’’ Loughman said. “Their hard work and dedication, combined with collaboration with our municipal and federal partners, is what keeps Connecticut moving in the right direction.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/JwkiN-how-did-the-crime-rate-change-in-each-ct-town-2023-to-2024--1024x872.png,,,2025-10-17 12:04:48.625493

(Photo courtesy of Sanford Health)SIOUX FALLS — The key to improving rural health care in the Dakotas is more than telehealth, according to health and innovation experts.
It’ll require providing rural residents with tools to monitor their own health, and nearby hubs or health care access to conduct basic tests ahead of telehealth visits with specialists.
“How do we have both the tools and the training to tell you how to use them so that the care can start even before the ambulance gets there?” said Nworah Ayogu, a physician and investor in health care technology. 
Ayogu, who is also a member of the Sanford Health Plan board, was one panelist to speak about efforts to improve rural access to affordable and quality health care at the fourth annual Summit on the Future of Rural Health Care hosted by Sanford Health in Sioux Falls on Tuesday. 
Investments in tech aim to relieve some challenges, panelists say
Ateev Mehrotra, a physician and professor at Brown University School of Public Health, urged caution in the health care industry’s rush to invest in artificial intelligence.
As a panelist alongside Ayogu, Mehrotra added that the investment shouldn’t be made to the detriment of patient care and that health systems should ensure there is evidence supporting the technology is a good investment of their money.
Mehrotra highlighted the gap in telehealth use nationwide for rural and urban patients. Even though telehealth was created in large part to address rural needs, he said, urban patients tend to use the technology more consistently. Rural patients nationwide will also sometimes bypass their local, smaller hospitals to get care from larger hospital systems hundreds of miles away.
“It’s not the technology; the technology can fix this problem. It’s rather how we’re deploying it right now in the United States,” Mehrotra said. “And so that’s really what I’m focused on, which is how do we change the way that we’re using telehealth in the United States so that we can finally address that big gap.”

The gap could also be due to a lack of adequate technology access, Mehrotra said.
Most patients Dave Newman sees have access to broadband, said the Fargo, North Dakota-based endocrinologist and chief medical officer of virtual care at Sanford. But he has had telehealth visits with farmers on their phones during harvest season or with a patient still with a rotary phone.
Telehealth does not require complex technology, but simply meeting the patients where they’re at, Newman said. The virtual care center has more than 75 specialties now, he added.
Health systems like Sanford are working to improve virtual care, including training providers on “webside manners” and establishing a network of clinics and access points close to rural residents, Newman said. 
“We consider ourselves a hub and we support multiple different spokes,” Newman said. “What the spokes are is dependent on what patients need.”
As an example, he said a clinic in Williston, North Dakota, with a nurse, lab and imaging facilities can run tests a patient needs before a telehealth visit with a subspecialist in Fargo or Sioux Falls “without having to travel the huge distance.”
Avera Health, another major health system in South Dakota, was awarded a three-year federal grant to invest in its virtual nursing program, which connects virtual nurses to patients in hospital rooms. The program also uses AI to monitor patient falls in hospitals, which Avera Virtual Health Director Kristine Becker told South Dakota Searchlight after the award announcement will “shape the way” hospital systems deliver care.
Further investment in remote patient monitoring, equipment at home and other technology can improve rural care even further, participants at the conference said.
Although AI could potentially increase efficiencies, nurses and clinicians are still needed to care for South Dakota’s growing and aging population, panelists said. 
$50 billion for rural health
State governments can further help address rural health needs by bringing partners together, Ayogu and Newman said, and ensuring medical students and doctors receive training pertinent to practicing in a “new world.”
Mehrotra added that the state could facilitate e-consults across the state and across health care systems to improve care, and it could provide licensure reciprocity with nearby states so South Dakotans could receive virtual care from out-of-state providers rather than traveling hundreds of miles to Minneapolis or other larger health care systems.
Adequately reimbursing telehealth services for patients on Medicare or Medicaid, which brings together state and federal players, was top of mind for Newman and other panelists.
“We know it’s effective, and there have been temporary fixes,” Newman said. “We have had kind of a Band-Aid instead of an actual fix to the problem. The funding bills now have a longer fix, but nothing has been done to reassure the health care systems or the providers that are doing this care that they will continue to see reimbursement.”
Republican South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden highlighted the state’s efforts in recent years at the conference, including a “game changer” telemedicine program meant to bolster rural ambulance services. The program was launched with pandemic relief funds during former Gov. Kristi Noem’s administration.

He added that the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program will be a new opportunity, with over $500 million of those funds expected to reach South Dakotans in the next five years. The fund was created to offset the impact of Medicaid changes on rural hospitals created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Donald Trump in July.
“I think that there’s going to be a sizable investment in rural health care in South Dakota,” Rhoden said.
American Hospital Association President and CEO Rick Pollack called the $50 billion five-year investment “modest” compared to the $1 trillion in funding hospitals nationwide are expected to lose in the next decade.
“They’re going to look for transformation in terms of different approaches,” Pollack said during a panel discussion, “whether it’s expanding access to behavioral health services, whether it’s telehealth, whether it’s using different technologies in terms of virtual care, whether it’s how you can retain and grow a workforce in rural areas.”

Connecticut has the highest percentage of residents with Italian ancestry in the United States, with about 15% of its population, or roughly 562,000 people, identifying as Italian American, according to 2023 data from World Population Review. Rhode Island follows closely with 14.6%, and New Jersey ranks third at 13%.
New York had the highest total population of Italian Americans at 2.2 million, which make up 11% of the state’s population. Connecticut ranks 10th in total population.
Italian immigration to Connecticut surged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as thousands arrived from southern Italy and Sicily seeking industrial jobs. They settled in cities like New Haven, Waterbury, Bridgeport, Hartford and New Britain, working in factories, on railroads and in construction. Over generations, Italian Americans helped shape the state’s economy, neighborhoods and culture.
Each October, the state celebrates that lasting legacy during Italian American Heritage and Culture Month.

I didn’t leave.
That simple phrase carries more weight than most people realize. As a millennial born and raised in Mississippi, I’ve heard all the reasons to go, and I’ve watched many of my peers follow through.
But I stayed. Not because it was easy, but because I believe in the soil here. Mississippi is not just where I’m from. It’s where I’m building something that reflects the best of who we are and what we can become.
I’m Dyamone L. White, a daughter of western Hinds County – Edwards to be exact. I am a banker and housing strategist by training and a community developer at heart. But in this season of my life, I’m something more: a hospitality entrepreneur, a creative economy advocate and the founder of The High Horse: Bite & Beverage Barn of Bolton – a modern-day juke joint and cultural venue rooted in Mississippi pride.  
The High Horse isn’t just a bar or music spot. It’s a bet – a bet that Mississippi’s culture, stories and soul are not only worth preserving but worth investing in. It’s my answer to the question: What if we stopped exporting our best and brightest, and instead created the kind of spaces that made them want to stay?

The idea came to life during a drive through Louisiana when I stumbled upon the concept of beer barns — informal, deeply local gathering spots that once populated the rural South. Curious, I dug deeper and discovered these spaces weren’t just a Louisiana thing. Mississippi had them too. Changing times wiped them out.
Around that same time, I visited Ground Zero Blues Club in Clarksdale. I saw how music, memory and place could intersect to create something magnetic. The vision started to form.
At first, I called the project Beer Run: The Beer Barn of Bolton. But as the idea matured, I partnered with Crema, a marketing and branding agency in Ridgeland.
After hearing my story, they quickly landed on a name that captured the spirit of what I was building: The High Horse. It is not just a brand, but a statement that we, as a people, deserve to feel elevated.
But as I brought the project to life, I saw more clearly than ever how poverty, displacement and disinvestment continue to choke not only our neighborhoods, but our hope. That’s when it clicked. Mississippi’s economic revival must be tied to its cultural revival.
And I still believe Mississippi already has everything it needs. It just takes someone bold enough to light the fire.
The High Horse is that fire. It’s a place where the blues isn’t background noise – it’s the heartbeat. It is where Black Southern foodways, music, storytelling and style converge under one roof. It is where tradition and progress don’t compete; they dance together.
On any given weekend, The High Horse transforms into something bigger than its square footage, hosting everything from blues jams and cultural parades to health fairs and voter registration drives. But the vision stretches beyond events or entertainment. It’s a blueprint that merges culture and commerce, storytelling and strategy, tourism and talent retention.
That’s why the recent Mississippi Today essay by Danielle Morgan of the Mississippi Tourism Association about the importance of tourism in the state moved me so deeply. It gave language to something I’ve lived: the tension of loving this place while working every day to transform it. Her writing made me feel seen. In return, I want this essay to make others feel possible.
We hear so much about those who left. I want to speak to, and for, the ones who stayed. The ones who are building something from scratch. The ones who see potential in the overlooked. The ones who know that investing in Mississippi isn’t foolish. It’s forward-thinking.
This journey hasn’t been easy. I’ve had to teach myself tax law, sift through local ordinances and figure out marketing and operations in real time. But every time someone walks through the doors and says, “This feels like home,” it reaffirms why I do it.
And I’m not alone. All across Mississippi, people like me are quietly – and boldly – building. We deserve a seat at the table in the tourism conversation. We are creating the next Mississippi.
So, no, I didn’t leave. I chose to stay. And every song sung, every meal served, every story shared at The High Horse is a love letter to the place I’m still betting on.

Detroit’s mayoral candidates may be far apart about how they should solve many of the city’s challenges, but their views on improving education in the city sound similar.
Rev. Solomon Kinloch, Jr., the pastor at Triumph Church in Detroit, and Mary Sheffield, the president of the Detroit City Council, faced off Wednesday night during a televised debate on WXYZ-TV. Moderators asked one question about education, but related topics such as child poverty, transportation, and safety also came up.
Education has been an issue throughout the campaign because of the depth of Detroit’s school challenges. Low academic achievement and high rates of chronic absenteeism are big problems in district and charter schools. While the mayor doesn’t have control over how schools are operated, the person elected can play a role in addressing many of the barriers that make it difficult for children to learn, including housing instability, a lack of transportation, and extreme poverty.
Here’s what they had to say at Wednesday night’s debate.
 How will the candidates help improve education in Detroit?

Moderator Carolyn Clifford noted the city’s high rate of illiteracy and the most recent results for the Detroit Public Schools Community District on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, in which just 5% of district students were proficient or above in reading. Noting that the mayor has no control over district and charter schools in the city, she asked the candidates, “What can a mayor do to help ensure Detroit kids can read, can learn, and succeed?
Kinloch repeated what he’s said throughout the campaign: that he would “be an educational mayor” and would create a cabinet-level position that would partner with the school district. Though the city has dozens of charter schools, Kinloch only mentioned partnering with the district. Kinloch said that while “the school district is not the mayor’s job, it’s still the mayor’s responsibility.”
“What we will do is partner with the district to make sure that we’re removing the social ills that keep the children from showing up in class in a productive way, not to just to survive, but to thrive. There are a whole lot of things that take place before those children get to class. And so we got to make sure that they have access to mental health professionals, that they have access to affordable housing, that they have access to food and grocery stores and healthy eating, that they have access to extra curriculum activities to keep them off the street and give them a sanctuary to be safe.”
Sheffield said she believes the mayor “can be a greater partner to drive better outcomes for our youth” and that every child deserves access to a quality education.
“My administration will have a liaison working directly with our DPSCD and charter schools on a consistent basis. We will ensure that we have robust after school programming within a two mile radius of every school, focusing in on literacy. We will provide the wraparound service and address the social deterrents that prevent and impact our families and our students, like mental health and housing and having support in the schools and on the grounds to support our families and students. And lastly, as a mayor, I can ensure that we have safe routes to school and fixing the infrastructure around our schools and providing more coordinated transportation to reduce absenteeism and get our students back in school.”
 Setting students up for post-high school success

At various points during the debate, Sheffield and Kinloch talked about ensuring that children are set up for success once they leave high school.
Sheffield noted that the Detroit Promise, a scholarship program that gives eligible Detroit residents a tuition-free path to an associate degree, bachelor’s degree, or technical certificate, already provides opportunities for Detroit youth.
“We want to enhance that program and ensure that we’re creating pathways so that everyone who wants to receive secondary education has a pathway to do so,” Sheffield said.
Kinloch made a similar statement.
“I’ll make sure that every child has access to a quality education, giving them a pathway to college and giving them a pathway to a career,” Kinloch said.
 Crime may be down, but safety is still an issue

Chalkbeat heard from a number of students earlier this year who said they often feel unsafe in the city, avoid being out in large groups because they fear what could happen, and worry about violence as they travel to and from school. That’s despite crime being down in the city.
At Wednesday night’s debate, candidates were asked how they explain the disconnect between the statistics and what people say in their neighborhoods and what they would do if elected mayor to solve this problem.
Kinloch noted that as a pastor, he has had to “give children dignity in death that they didn’t get in life because their life was taken too soon.”
He said one of the reasons there is a disconnect is “because Detroiters deserve two things. They deserve safety and they deserve justice.” He also suggested that the city is “fudging” crime statistics. BridgeDetroit and the Detroit Free Press reported that after the debate, Kinloch explained his comments, saying there should be additional oversight into how crimes are tracked.
Sheffield noted the reduction in crime stats, but also said “one life lost is still far too many.”
“I believe in a comprehensive and holistic approach to public safety that is rooted in strong partnerships with our law enforcement agencies in our community. I will ensure as mayor that we are investing in prevention, more year round, youth employment for our young people, ensure that we’re expanding our community violence intervention work.”
Her plan also includes launching the city’s first ever office of gun violence prevention and expanding community policing efforts.
 Improving public transportation is important

The candidates were asked to explain how they would improve public transit in the city. While the question wasn’t specific to education or students, the city’s transportation woes affect school attendance. Many students take city buses to and from school, and Chalkbeat has heard from students who say the buses frequently arrive late, making them late for school, or don’t show up at all.
Transportation barriers are one of the reasons the DPSCD chronic absenteeism rate is high. The rate is improving, but 60% of students were chronically absent in the 2024-25 school year. At least one DPSCD school is experimenting with distributing bikes to students to make it easier for their children to get to school.
Sheffield said the most pressing issue is addressing public transportation wait times.
“We have to ensure that no one is waiting 30, 40, 50 minutes to catch a bus. And so as mayor, my number one priority is to reduce wait times, increase frequency and reliability of our system, make sure that our drivers are paid the wages that they deserve, and make sure that the system is safe.”
Kinloch said the city needs to ensure it is offering competitive pay to transit workers, has reliable vehicles, and has trained mechanics.
“I remember growing up in the city of Detroit, and the only way I can get from point A to point B is I had to depend on public transportation,” said Kinloch, who said improving the transit system is a necessity. “A lot of our school children are dependent on public transportation. Our family, our community is dependent on public transportation.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)It really doesn’t matter if you’re lost in a MAGA fog trying to be a warrior for a deluded president, when Montana’s senators are on national news, they represent all Montanans to the world.  And this week, Montana’s freshman senator, Tim Sheehy, embarrassed all Montanans with his rude, evasive, and uninformed interview with CNN’s Kaitlin Collins, one of the most professional and respected reporters in the world.
It’s hard to figure out just what Sheehy was doing when given an opportunity to discuss the effects of the fiscal impacts of the Trump administration’s budget cuts.  What he did instead was pull a bully act and repeatedly interrupt, talk over, and ignore Collins’ questions.
The zinger happened when Collin, who had done her homework, reminded Sheehy that a billion dollar Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub project that included Montana had been cancelled by Trump’s Energy Department — and did not exist in the GOP’s short-term funding bill sitting in the Senate.
Apparently Sheehy, for all his bluster and macho man attempts at dominating Collins, did not do his homework — and had no idea the project’s funding had been cancelled.  Instead, he sat in stunned silence for several seconds, then once again ignored the facts to falsely claim that’s why the government shutdown should end.  You can see the interview Collins posted on X here. 
Fact is, Sheehy’s lack of policy experience — and apparent lack of knowledge on what’s going on with the impacts of the administration’s budgets on Montana and Montanans — was on full display for the nation and world.  Although his job is to understand where, how, and why the federal government spends or doesn’t spend money Congress has appropriated, Sheehy was too busy playing-acting as an important senator to actually do the job of being a senator.
Adding to Sheehy’s obvious ignorance of the issue, Collins pointed out that Montana’s Gov. Greg Gianforte had previously praised the hydrogen hub project as providing “good-paying Montana jobs.”
While it’s bad enough Sheehy didn’t know what he was talking about, the image he presented of how Montanans treat other people was downright disgusting.  Maybe it’s because he’s not lived in Montana for very long and doesn’t appear to understand that mutual respect is not only cherished in this state, but essential in the political and policy arena.  He also appears not to know that Montanans have a national and international reputation for being considerate and helpful to those who visit our state — we’re not a bunch of MAGA’s mad dogs.
Nor would Sheehy address the fact that the GOP’s funding bill leaves 67,000 Montanans on the hook for vast increases in the cost of health insurance — from $145 per month with the tax credits to a whopping $645 without.  While those very real impacts are the reason the bill is not moving in the Senate, all he wanted to do was bash Democrats for the shutdown, despite the fact they are in the minority in both chambers of Congress.
Ironically, while Montana’s very junior senator was busy ignoring the impacts to his constituents, Washington’s Sen. Patty Murray did address that enormous impact in a video forum with the head of the Montana Nurses Association and state Sen. Cora Neuman.  Succinctly, Murray noted that Republican senators are “dodging the issue.” Indeed, Sheehy’s embarrassing performance completely validates that point.
Apparently being a U.S. senator has gone to Sheehy’s young and inexperienced head.  But he’d best remember he’s representing Montanans on the national and world stage — and that we treat others with respect and expect the same from our senators.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sheehysept192025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-17 12:04:48.625493

When no one in your family has gone to college, applying to a higher education institution and choosing a career can feel confusing and intimidating. 
Some students also struggle with additional barriers, like those that come from low-income families and might not know how they’ll pay for going to college or university. In Hartford, for example, 76% of students are from low-income families, according to data from the School and State Finance Project.
But many places, including Hartford, have mentors, programs and organizations dedicated to helping high school students navigate the path toward becoming first-generation college students.
Here are some of the resources students can talk to their school guidance counselors about or reach out to directly for more information.
Are there resources targeted to first-generation students?
Some national resources exist for first-generation students across the U.S. These include:

Rise First has an online platform with a curated resource center for first generation students. It has a specific directory for Connecticut first gen students.


First Gen Forward is home to the “first academic peer-reviewed journal dedicated to first-generation student success.” You can read free articles about the latest issues.

Other national resources include The Dream.US, which is targeted at DREAMers, but offers some scholarships specifically geared toward helping first-generation DREAMers. The Dream.US offers scholarship opportunities based on the state you live in, a guide to apply to them and a list of partner colleges.
What about resources closer to home?
Hartford has a strong network of organizations that support high school students in every step, from financial college access to career mentorship to parental guides and more.
Hartford Promise is a college scholarship and mentoring program for Hartford Public School students. There are a couple of requirements, such as maintaining a certain GPA and school attendance, to become a Promise Scholar and be eligible for scholarships. Every new Hartford Promise Scholar is now eligible for up to $100,000 over four years toward any accredited four-year college. Hartford Promise also has a list of colleges that provide a scholarship match to Promise Scholars who are admitted to their school.
Hartford Public School’s College and Career Readiness Programs offer a range of resources, including a list of school counselors, essay writing tips, financial aid resources and more.
For Hartford youth starting their college preparedness plans before middle school, Hartford Youth Scholars offers support from middle school through the college years for youth. To apply, the student first needs to be nominated by a teacher, mentor, parent/guardian or through self-nomination.
The Legacy Foundation of Hartford provides an academic enhancement program for students and families who enroll in their Legacy Saturday Academy. It offers academic support and college coaching to the admitted scholars at University of Hartford campus. There is no GPA requirement nor cost to enroll.
ECMC, which has an office in Hartford, works to lower student loan default rates, sponsor college access and success initiatives, and financial literacy programs. You can set Zoom and phone appointments to discuss any college or financial aid-related questions or concerns, including FAFSA assistance. Students can register to receive personalized emails and texts. 
ReadyCT designs and delivers work-based learning experiences in line with career opportunities across the state like work-site tours, resume reviews and paid internships. Hartford students can apply to Student 5.0, a free mentorship career launch program for high school graduates.
There are also resources available for parents as well. Hartford Parent University offers learning sessions where parents can learn how to support their child’s college readiness.
And the state of Connecticut’s higher education website shares general programs and resources to help students pick a school, pay for it and more.
Is there specific support for immigrant families?
CT Students for a Dream supports families with mixed immigration statuses. They have junior and senior high school calendar plans to get to college, a list of private colleges that accept undocumented students as domestic students and not international students, contact information for the college access program coordinator, a parent guide to understand the college process in Spanish, and a video on how to apply to FAFSA and Common App for Undocumented Students. The organization accompanies students to financial aid office meetings in case there are questions about tax filings or parental immigration status.
Make the Road, an immigrant advocacy organization, hosts biweekly virtual parent meetings, where they discuss education campaigns and explain educational systems including the path to college.
ECMC has a guide in English and in Spanish of resources to help get through the process of accessing and succeeding in college as an undocumented student among other guides.
Do any colleges offer pre-college programs? 
University of Connecticut offers college access programs such as the Collegiate Awareness Preparation program and the Upward Bound Program. They prepare Connecticut students from underserved communities in grades 9-12 and at the post-secondary level with tutoring, mentoring, financial advising, and even mental and physical health activities. UConn also is home to the First Gen Families portal as a landing point for first-generation students.
Connecticut State Community Colleges, including the Hartford campus, have the Early College and Dual Enrollment program, which allows high school students to take classes online, or even at their own high school. Credits earned may count towards both the high school diploma and college degree.
Trinity College has the HMTCA-Trinity Partnership. This is an early college experience that partners Hartford Magnet Trinity College Academy with Trinity College. HMTCA is an interdistrict magnet school. From its start in 2011, the partnership created opportunities for students and faculty at Trinity and the academy to build connections through Trinity mentors, summer writing programs and opportunities to take college courses.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FB_IMG_1760552946087-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-17 14:57:59.771360

The contract includes a noncompete clause, which bars physicians from working at a competing hospital after leaving. An author of Minnesota’s 2023 ban on noncompete agreements says the contract likely violates the law, though labor law experts say it’s unclear how a court might rule.
Aspirus, a health system based out of Wausau, Wis., merged with St. Luke’s Duluth in 2023 and operates 19 hospitals and over 100 outpatient clinics across Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota.
The Minnesota Attorney General’s office is now investigating physicians’ complaints and served Aspirus a subpoena Thursday, said Elizabeth Odette, the assistant attorney general who manages the office’s antitrust division.
The office has “enough information for a reasonable basis to investigate” whether Aspirus is violating Minnesota’s noncompete law, Odette said. “Now we just need to gather the information to determine whether there is a violation of law.”
The investigation is still in its preliminary stages, and Thursday was the first time the office reached out to Aspirus.
An Aspirus spokesperson declined to comment in an email.
This is not the first time the health system has faced scrutiny for its labor practices — in 2021, Aspirus paid $1.5 million to settle a class action lawsuit around employees’ retirement plans. Aspirus St. Luke’s is also currently being sued by a Duluth physician in a class action suit alleging wage theft.
The 2023 hospital merger between Aspirus and St. Luke’s is part of a broader trend of health care consolidation. A wide body of research, reviewed by health policy research organization KFF, has shown that health care consolidation has depressed employee wages and led to higher prices but not necessarily better care.
In Minnesota, the “factory style” of modern medicine, a consequence of sweeping health care consolidation, has led doctors at Allina to unionize in 2023. Aspirus physicians have yet to unionize.
‘Very physician-unfriendly and very administration-friendly’
The Reformer reviewed the contracts and drafts of new amendments for two Aspirus physicians, who were granted anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media and fear retaliation. The amendment includes significant changes to sections on compensation, physician’s duties and termination.
Several physicians were told that failure to sign would be taken as a resignation, according to both physicians who spoke to the Reformer.
“I wouldn’t have signed this if I was looking for a job,” said one physician. She described the amended contract as “very physician-unfriendly and very administration-friendly.” The administration has new power to change work hours and location and how many patients doctors see.
Some physicians are seeing significant pay cuts as part of the process, said another physician.
Minnesota-based physicians are also “upset that they’re going to be shackled to the noncompete,” despite the 2023 state law banning them in new agreements, said the second physician. The contract amendments retained an existing noncompete from the physicians’ previous contract, which was renewed on a yearly basis — and thus also arguably unenforceable because a renewed contract is considered a new agreement, employment lawyers say.

Noncompetes: From Jimmy John’s to hospitals
Noncompetes bar workers from leaving a company and working at a competing company nearby for a period of time; the goal is ostensibly to prevent workers from taking trade secrets and client lists — in this case, patient lists — after leaving.
Noncompetes have emerged as an intensely debated legal and political issue in recent years, especially since Jimmy John’s got sued in 2014 for forcing sandwich makers to sign them. Since then, some legal scholars have defended noncompetes, seeking to rebut research that’s shown how they can suppress wages and innovation.
Workers with noncompetes are partially hamstrung in any pay negotiation — and likely to stay put — because they can’t seek out more lucrative work elsewhere or found a competing company. To help workers and spur innovation, the Biden-era Federal Trade Commission moved to ban noncompetes in 2024, though the ban was immediately blocked in federal courts. In September, the commission dropped the effort for an across-the-board ban and instead is now focusing on targeting specific companies that use noncompetes improperly.
The federal pullback makes Minnesota’s legislation more important for Minnesota workers.
When is a noncompete unenforceable?
Employment lawyers interviewed by the Reformer said that the heavily amended contract makes it a new agreement, voiding the noncompete. Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, who co-authored the 2023 legislation, said that she couldn’t think of a way that the Duluth hospital’s noncompete “could be enforceable and legal.”
“Once you change the contract or renew the contract, or once the parties are different, that’s a new contract to need consideration, and this ban would apply to that,” said Greenman, who is an attorney, in an interview.
Even when a noncompete is unenforceable, however, it can spook employees into not seeking new jobs, according to a study from the University of Michigan Law School. Employers will sometimes include unenforceable noncompetes in their contracts because of the chilling effect when workers don’t know their rights.
Bert Black, an attorney who has previously written about Minnesota noncompetes, said the physician noncompete sounds unenforceable, though he cautioned that “you can’t say unequivocally, this is the law,” because Minnesota courts have said little if anything on the subject after 2023.
Regardless of the state’s noncompete ban, noncompete clauses have always been subject to limitations based on factors like reasonableness and impact on consumers.
“That’s especially true with physician noncompetes,” said Rachel Arnow-Richman, a professor of labor law in Florida. “The concern of patient choice and access to health care adds another dimension.”
One of the Northland doctors said they are concerned about their patients. “There’s not enough doctors here to take care of everybody that needs care,” said the physician. “But again, I’m also not sure I want to sign this.”
The effect of banning noncompetes, the physician said, should be that “providers at least have some freedom to quit a lousy job, stay in the community where they live and keep providing care.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-91540120-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-10-17 12:04:48.625493

This one would bring 156 condominiums — a quarter of which would be set aside as affordable housing — to a neighborhood in the central part of the island. Opposition to new housing on Nantucket puts the island squarely in company with lots of affluent communities in Massachusetts, where efforts to address a dire housing shortage often run into stiff resistance.  
But in the latest chapter of the battle on Nantucket, which has stretched on for seven years, opponents have seized on an issue often championed by communities of color and progressive activists to fight industrial pollution in low-income communities as part of their campaign to block affordable housing in a high-cost enclave where it is desperately needed.  
Based on the 2020 Census, the section of Nantucket where developers hope to build their 40B affordable housing project known as Surfside Crossing is now recognized as an environmental justice community under state rules.  
To qualify, an area’s population must have below-average median household income or high percentages of minority individuals or households with limited English proficiency. This part of Nantucket, home to a large Hispanic community, qualifies an environmental justice community because minorities make up 40 percent or more of the population.  
Citing the new environmental justice designation, residents opposed to the project filed a “fail-safe review” petition with the state’s top environmental official on August 25 — a direct appeal to Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper to order the developer to release additional environmental information before the project can advance, a move that would further stall the proposal.  
Whether it’s just a calculated bid to pull any available lever in the NIMBY arsenal or the legitimate invocation of a serious environmental threat, or perhaps both, is now in the hands of the Healey administration. 
It’s the exact kind of bureaucratic wrangling Gov. Maura Healey has sought to reduce, and it cuts right at the heart of the tensions surrounding her push to build 220,000 new homes by 2035. And while Healey has also voiced strong support for environmental justice issues, she has proposed changes to regulations under the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act, the main law governing state environmental review of development projects, that her administration say are aimed at promoting more affordable housing.  
The project is filed under the state’s 40B affordable housing law, which lets developers bypass local zoning approval in communities where less than 10 percent of existing housing stock is deemed affordable if they set aside 20 to 25 percent of units as affordable housing. 
Like all development proposals, however, 40B projects are still subject to environmental regulation.  
The Surfside project would be located within the public water supply zone for an EPA-designated sole source aquifer that “if contaminated, would create a significant hazard to public health,” according to the agency. A 2018 hydrogeologic assessment of the project found that there is “increased potential” for contamination that could “impair the Town’s water supply,” though the report ultimately concluded that the proposal does not present a significant threat to Nantucket’s water. 
Opponents have cited the threat to the local water supply in their petition to the state for further review under the environmental justice designation. They also argue that the presence of five other affordable housing projects within a 1-mile radius of the proposed site creates “an overwhelming and disproportionate burden on one section of the island” — overdevelopment concerns that town officials have shared from the beginning.   
“I think that rules are in place to safeguard communities are important, and I think when politicians or developers try to streamline those or circumvent them, or look for a waiver from them, that’s the only reason to do it: because you’re trying to do something outside of what should be allowed,” said Meghan Perry, who serves on the board of Nantucket Tipping Point, a local group that has fought the housing proposal. “If you don’t have clean water, it doesn’t matter how many housing units you have.” 
The Healey administration wouldn’t comment on the pending petition, but it is sticking by its view that the state can unlock more housing production by streamlining permitting and speeding up approvals. 
“The same communities that face some of the biggest environmental issues also struggle to find affordable, energy efficient homes,” Maria Hardiman, a spokesperson for the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, said in a statement. “Gov. Healey’s proposed changes to [Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act] regulations will help us ensure that we’re incentivizing the kinds of housing we need the most – dense, affordable, and resilient projects with low energy bills. This kind of balanced approach can help us build healthier, more affordable neighborhoods.”

The developers of the Surfside project took aim at the use of the environmental justice designation as little more than a cynical attempt to find any excuse to block affordable housing on the island.   
“In my 40-plus years developing affordable housing I have seen so many fake claims from the NIMBY crowd aimed at stopping much-needed housing, but this might take the cake as the most hypocritical and disingenuous move ever,” said Josh Posner, Surfside Crossing’s co-developer. “We hope [the state environmental policy office] can see through this upside-down perversion of the environmental justice guidelines and not inadvertently establish yet another tool for opponents trying to kill this high quality, well-located development.”   
Nantucket is rightly regarded as the ultimate New England address of the ultra-rich, with a median home sale price last year of $2.8 million. A waterfront compound sold for more than $38 million in 2023, shattering the record for the most paid for a single residence on Nantucket, and more than half of the island’s housing units are owned by seasonal residents.  
Elsewhere on the island, though, the first overnight housing shelter on Nantucket opened two years ago to accommodate a growing population of year-round residents that can’t make ends meet. The median home sale price has risen nearly 90 percent over the last five years ago as wealthy buyers snatch up vacation homes, compounding the island’s permanent affordable housing challenges tied to its limited land availability and high costs of shipping in construction materials. 
Housing advocates are urging Healey to keep the focus on the need to reduce the state’s cost of living. Jesse Kanson-Benavav, executive director of Abundant Housing Massachusetts, said that protracted reviews like the one sought by the Surfside opponents can ultimately hurt the community that the reviews are intended to protect. 
“This is a tension point for us in Massachusetts,” said Kanson-Benavav, who also served on Healey’s Commission on Unlocking Housing Production. “We want to protect environmental justice communities. At the same time, what are we giving up when we’re making it incredibly costly to build homes around those communities? When it takes a year or more for an environmental review to be completed, that increases costs. Those costs are borne somewhere, and where they are borne is in the ultimate rental or sale prices of the homes that are built in that project if it is finally completed.” 
But Tristan Thomas, director of policy at the Roxbury-based Alternatives for Community & Environment, a nonprofit focused on environmental justice, or EJ, issues, said it’s important to separate whatever motives one thinks might be driving opponents from the facts on the ground or, in this case, underground.  
“I wouldn’t be surprised if it was just some NIMBY community trying to use whatever law in the books to keep their neighborhood quiet or keep their neighborhood how they want it to be,” Thomas said. “But if the aquifer needs to be protected, and there are legitimate EJ concerns, I’m glad that there’s a law to work it through a process to make a determination.” 
Marcos Luna, professor of geography and sustainability at Salem State University and a member of the state’s Environmental Justice Council, said he fully recognizes the dire conditions of a lack of affordable housing in Massachusetts as a whole — which itself disproportionately hurts those that environmental justice laws are aimed at protecting. At the same time, Luna said he’s skeptical of efforts to get rid of red tape for the sake of it, since those rules were put in place to correct past mistakes of overdevelopment without due consideration. 
That’s precisely what makes projects like Surfside Crossing so difficult for state and local officials to navigate.  
“On the Cape and Islands, housing affordability is a real crisis, and a significant amount of folks who are crucial to the workforce and are themselves residents and deserve access to housing,” he said. “That’s a real thing – as real as water. It should be evaluated in that context.” 
State officials already reviewed the project five years ago and declined to require the additional environmental scrutiny now sought through the environmental justice petition. That endorsement of the project came after the developer in 2020 changed its proposal from a mix of multi-unit buildings and single-family homes to only multi-unit buildings with fewer overall bedrooms. 
The state-level Housing Appeals Committee, which has oversight on 40B projects, approved that new plan. But opponents went to court, arguing that the 2020 changes were substantial enough that the review process should start over. A Superior Court ruling found in their favor, ordering the project to go back through the bureaucratic wheel by remanding it to the local zoning board.  
The Nantucket Zoning Board of Appeals rejected the proposal in a unanimous 5-0 decision earlier this year. Surfside Crossing promptly took the case for a second time to the state Housing Appeals Committee, which held a hearing last month on the proposal.  
But opponents have now thrown their environmental justice curveball, hoping Tepper, the environmental affairs secretary, will order further review of the project, while the developers are banking on the state Housing Appeals Committee to again green light it.  
All of that leaves the Healey administration walking something of a political and policy tightrope, trying to balance its commitment to environmental justice issues and its stated determination to see more housing built, even when it ruffles local feathers.  
“It’s true that these things have been used by people who are just opponents of housing,” said Mark Martinez, housing staff attorney at the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. “So there’s a big tension there. I don’t think there’s an easy bright red line that says here’s how you fix that to perfectly balance those tensions.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6557-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-17 10:58:52.818079

The added money will ensure the television ads are seen during this weekend’s Colts, IU and Notre Dame games, according to a news release.
“Hoosiers aren’t asking for this. Washington outsiders just won’t take ‘no’ for an answer,” ICV Executive Director Megan Robertson said. “They want us to cheat, and we’re not cheaters. Indiana lawmakers should be commended for resisting the pressure campaign. We hope they’ll stay focused on lowering costs and improving quality of life instead of embracing this political nonsense.”

Vice President JD Vance visited Indiana for a second time last week to urge Republican lawmakers and GOP Gov. Mike Braun to redo the state’s U.S. House maps. He and Hoosier officials also met in D.C.
Currently, Republicans control seven districts and Democrats have two in Indianapolis and northwest Indiana. The maps were drawn by Republicans in 2021 after the decennial census.
At the time, Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray said, “We prioritized keeping communities of interest together and drawing districts that make sense for the Hoosiers who live there, while maintaining nearly equal populations in each district. I believe these maps reflect feedback from the public and will serve Hoosiers well for the next decade.”
Supporters, though, want to draw a 9-0 map midway through the decade — and without new census data — to help ensure Republicans retain the majority in the U.S. House in the 2026 elections.
The media buy includes digital, radio and over-the-top streaming platforms. Multiple polls have found opposition to mid-decade redistricting.
Indiana Conservation Voters is encouraging residents to visit PlayFairIndiana.com to contact Braun and their state lawmakers.
“Every call and every message sends a clear signal: Hoosiers are not interested in political games from Washington,” Robertson said. “We want our leaders focused on Indiana’s future, not D.C.’s agenda.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA105180-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-17 10:58:52.818079

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)In the next few years, Alaskans could see sweeping changes to everyday life under an ambitious and far-reaching program launched by Gov. Mike Dunleavy.
Administrative Order 360, issued in August, calls on state agencies to reduce the number of state regulations by 15% before 2027 and 25% cumulatively before 2028.
Both deadlines would come after Dunleavy, who is term-limited, leaves office in December 2026. 
If laws are the bones of a state, regulations are the ligaments and connective tissue that keep it moving. Alaska’s administrative code, a shelflong 10-volume set of thick books, dictates everything from how to conduct an election to the proper labeling of eggs and the correct way to install an underground fuel tank.
Forty-five different professions are regulated by the state: Pharmacists follow the rules in that code, as do nail technicians, concert promoters, barbers, midwives, and people who euthanize animals. 
Elections officials operate under a system of regulations, as do local electric companies, water providers, and the people providing Internet service. Utilities, which have local monopolies on critical services, are tightly regulated, with even their profit margins controlled by the state.
Regulations are intended to protect the public and ensure safety, but some businesses see them as a problem, particularly if the cost of following them is high, or if they go beyond what the business owner thinks is warranted.
“There are often numerous, unnecessary requirements that simply impose an unnecessary burden on businesses, the public, and the agencies themselves,” says a regulatory reduction guide distributed by the Dunleavy administration to state agencies as part of the administrative project.
Development permitting regulations are a top priority
The governor’s order specifies that the departments of Natural Resources, Environmental Conservation and Fish and Game focus “on permitting process reform,” eliminating regulations that lay out steps to take before a development project like a new mine, road or neighborhood can be built. 
Attorney General-designee Stephen Cox began leading the Alaska Department of Law not long after Dunleavy issued AO 360, and his agency is taking a lead role in its implementation.
“One of the things that the governor is trying to do is make Alaska all the more attractive for investment,” he said. 
Sometimes, Cox said, regulations go farther than what was intended by law. Rather than serving as connective tissue, they can act “almost like a spider web” as additional forms and requirements are added over time, with none taken away.
“You might start out with a single strand, but then there becomes this whole web that you can walk right into. You can feel it everywhere. … it’s just sort of expanding and expanding, and it hardly ever shrinks, until the rain comes, and that’s what AO 360 will be akin to,” he said.
Department of Law officials believe the state has a large number of outdated regulations that could be easily removed. 
In other cases, regulations have adopted parts of federal law by reference, but agencies haven’t checked to see whether those federal laws have been repealed or changed in the meantime.
A cursory review shows some areas of the code haven’t kept up with technological development. “Telegraph” appears five times in the code, “fax” 16 times, “telex” four times. 
For many departments, the guide suggests that reducing training requirements or eliminating parts of mandatory forms could earn credit toward the governor’s goal, even if the main regulation stays in place.
“Consider, for instance, a requirement that an applicant for a professional license complete 1,000 hours of training before he or she can be certified. Some training is necessary, so the requirement should not be eliminated completely, but 1,000 hours may be excessive. Requiring 500 hours of training, for instance, may be sufficient,” the guide states.
Fairbanks writer Dermot Cole, a frequent critic of the Dunleavy administration, noted online that doctors are required by regulation to take 25 credit-hours of continuing-education classes each year. Under the guide, the state is encouraging Alaska’s state medical board to reduce that requirement, he argues. 
The guide states that when eliminating requirements, “agencies should be mindful of the important role of regulations in promoting public health, safety, and welfare, and developing our natural resources, and should not eliminate any requirements that are critical to protecting the public and the environment.”
Deadlines approach for early action
Already, state agencies have flooded Alaska’s public notice system with requests for Alaskans submit suggestions for regulations to eliminate. The first deadlines to do so are this week. 
According to a draft schedule, agencies have until Jan. 5 to draft “a proposed plan setting forth regulations identified for reform based upon stakeholder meetings.”
Final plans should be posted for review no later than Feb. 1. 
Further squeezing agencies is a requirement that they submit guidance documents — materials that tell Alaskans how to follow regulations — to the Department of Law for review. By Feb. 1, the department will make a determination whether those documents should themselves become regulations.
If they do, that would mean the agencies would have to make further cuts in order to fit their guidance documents within the number of regulations they’re allowed.
The state’s baseline number of regulations — a figure that will dictate how many regulations must be cut under the governor’s plan — was supposed to be published by Oct. 13, according to the draft schedule. It has not yet been finalized.
Seven agencies have completed or substantially completed their baseline count information, according to a spokesperson for the Department of Law. The remaining agencies have asked for an extension.
The Alaska Public Interest Research Group, a consumer watchdog, has been following the governor’s project with some alarm. It’s particularly concerned with upcoming changes to utility regulations.
“We support thoughtful, periodic review of regulations to make sure they’re effective and up to date. But this process isn’t that. By setting an arbitrary target for cuts and moving at breakneck speed, the state is creating a chaotic process that favors well-organized industry interests, leaves the public at a disadvantage, and places unnecessary strain on state agencies already stretched thin,” said AKPIRG regulatory analyst Brian Kassof.
“Regulations exist to protect the public interest and provide stability and certainty for communities and businesses. This rush to eliminate 15% of regulations across our state agencies does not leave adequate time for meaningful public engagement and risks creating unintended consequences that will be much harder to fix later.”
Alaska’s program follows others in Idaho and Virginia 
Dunleavy’s program is modeled after a similar one that began in Virginia in 2022, Cox said. That one was itself modeled after a different but similar effort in Idaho that started in 2019.
Both of those programs had the support of prominent national conservative groups, including the Federalist Society and the American Legislative Exchange Council, which has offered example programs to states for them to use. 
Think-tanks like the Heritage Foundation have called Virginia’s program a “role model for other states,” and the Hoover Institution praised both Virginia’s system and a newly launched one in Texas.
In July, after three years of work, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin held a ceremony to celebrate the fact that his state had beaten its 25% regulation-reduction goal. 
That event showed the similarities and differences between that state’s program and the one in the works for Alaska, which has fewer state agencies and regulations. 
Youngkin, for example, praised the elimination of tens of thousands of regulations related to home construction, something he claimed had reduced the cost of new homes in the state.
Here in Alaska, the state doesn’t regulate home construction. In Alaska’s administrative code, the word “house” appears only 316 times, and is more likely to apply to housing assistance or an ice fishing house than a residential structure.
Virginia’s program significantly reduced the rules governing how stormwater runoff is regulated. Andrew Wheeler, former EPA director for President Donald Trump, launched Virgnia’s program for Youngkin and said that before he started work, Virginia’s stormwater regulations formed a stack 23 inches high. Afterward, the stack was five inches high.
In Alaska’s administrative code, the word “stormwater” appears just seven times.
The federal government has taken steps toward regulatory reform under multiple Republican and Democratic administrations, but during the first Trump administration, the president tried regulatory budgeting and ordered that two federal regulations be repealed for every new one. That was new.
“They adopted something called regulatory budgeting, and so they would look for ways to reduce the number,” Cox said.
Something similar will be in place in Alaska. If an agency wants to enact a new regulation, it needs to find another to remove, while also pursuing additional removals to meet the 25% goal. 
Cox said AO 360 was issued with the federal context and other states’ context in mind.
“It’s with that goal of really unleashing the Alaska economy and inviting new investment into Alaska, that is motivating the governor in terms of why this is appropriate,” he said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/251015-Alaska-Administrative-Code-1024x616.jpg,,,2025-10-17 10:58:52.818079

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)Hopeful Horizons aids upwards of 1,500 survivors of child abuse, domestic violence and sexual assault annually across South Carolina’s five southernmost counties, offering free emergency housing, counseling, and legal services to those seeking help.
To fund its work, the Lowcountry organization and others like it rely heavily on a patchwork of federal grants, said Sara Barber, executive director of the S.C. Coalition Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault.
But that money has been dwindling since 2018 and was thrown into further uncertainty earlier this year amid lawsuits, budget disputes and funding clawbacks.
While legal challenges and a shutdown of the federal government still leave much unsettled — a recent series of grant funding did spell some relief for providers of victims’ services.
Domestic violence victims in SC can wait weeks for legal protections

Grants awarded
Most recently, Hopeful Horizons received a three-year, $500,000 grant to continue paying a lawyer and paralegal it has on staff to provide free legal aid. That’s on top of $1 million awarded to the organization late last month for its shelter and other services.
“Hopeful Horizons’ Legal Program helps more than 200 people each year obtain additional safety measures and support that they would otherwise not be able to access,” CEO Kristin Dubrowski said in a statement.
These legal professionals help victims fight for custody of their children, finalize divorces from abusive spouses and secure court orders of protection, Julia Haddick, the group’s chief development officer, told the SC Daily Gazette.
That’s essential in a state that, for years, has appeared at or near the top of national lists for the number of women killed by their male spouses and partners.

In addition, the state attorney general’s office, last month, doled out about $23 million in federal funding and $3 million in state funding to police departments, solicitors’ offices, hospitals and non-profit organizations statewide.
Despite the ongoing federal government shutdown, these organizations have access to a portion of the funding — enough to cover them through the end of the year.
Funding shrinks
The money comes from a pair of national laws — the Violence Against Women Act and Victims of Crime Act — the latter of which has seen declining revenues since 2018.
Congress passed the Victims of Crime Act in 1984, which established the Crime Victims Fund. Under the law, fines and penalties collected from people and businesses convicted of federal crimes are distributed to states.
For 15 years, Congress set an annual cap on withdrawals that remained below $1 billion annually until 2015. But because the cap was so low, money started piling up.
Congress then raised it to $2.3 billion. And in 2018 it peaked at $4.4 billion. Then, the funding plummeted. By fiscal year 2024, Congress had it set at $1.2 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, which oversees the grant programs.
Problems with the fund began as the Department of Justice was increasingly settling federal cases. Money from those settlements went into the general treasury instead of the Crime Victims Fund. By the time Congress passed a law in 2021 to fix it, the change was too late to make a major difference.
South Carolina reached a low of $12.4 million in its share of the funding last year, Barber said.
But there’s some hope as the most recent grant round, which started Oct. 1, came in at $20.3 million for the Palmetto State.
Among the organizations receiving funds, according to the state attorney general’s office, are the City of Anderson Police, which gets $93,520 to pay officers who investigate domestic violence cases; McLeod Regional Medical Center in Florence, which receives $251,900 to treat victims of sexual assault; and Helping And Lending Outreach and Support (HALOS), a Charleston nonprofit that helps grandparents and other relatives who are raising children to keep them out of foster care. In all, 140 groups received money.
Greater needs
New SC chief justice seeks extra Family Court judges to handle backlogged cases

Still, need continues to outpace the funding that’s available to these groups, Barber said.
On any given day, South Carolina’s 15 domestic violence organizations might provide services to 688 victims, according to the latest survey conducted by the National Network to End Domestic Violence. Another 48 victims will go without help because the organizations lack the resources.
The majority of those unmet needs are for emergency shelter or other housing, one of the top issues facing these organizations in the state as the population has ballooned and housing prices soar, Barber said.
To offset the federal funding losses, Attorney General Alan Wilson has asked legislators for state funding to fill the gap.
In 2022, the Legislature approved $10 million in one-time funding to establish the Supplemental Allocation for Victims Services program in the state.
In 2024, legislators set aside just $5 million in one-time funds, a third of what Wilson requested. And in the most recent budget, they included $19.5 million in one-time funds as well as $216,000 in additional aid that will continue annually. The program received no state funding in 2023.
Impacts
Worries over the future of federal aid to crime victim organizations reached a fever pitch in April, when the Department of Justice started clawing back $800 million in previously awarded grants.
In South Carolina, that included four, multi-year grants:

$400,000 to the Charleston Jewish Federation for a project to “track, respond to, and educate about issues of antisemitism and all forms of hate.”
$2 million for Prisma Health-Midlands to treat substance abuse, as well as mental and emotional health care for those facing issues such as unemployment, homelessness and a lack of education
And a pair of grants worth $1.9 million for Serve & Connect, a Columbia-based nonprofit focused on creating connections between police and the community. One of the grants funded police outreach to youth groups in northeast Columbia.

Hundreds of girls in SC are trafficking victims. A Columbia nonprofit offers help for survivors.

A federal judge, in July, threw out a lawsuit seeking to block the cuts, according to The Associated Press.
The unspent funding that remained on the grants when cancelled is unknown. Neither Serve & Connect nor the Jewish Federation responded to messages from the SC Daily Gazette. And Prisma Health did not provide information ahead of deadline.
The reason for grant cancellations also is unknown.
Meanwhile, a series of legal battles over use of new funds continues.
Democratic attorneys general in 20 states sued the Department of Justice this month over a new rule barring organizations that receive funds from providing services to domestic violence and rape survivors whose immigration status is in question. That rule was supposed to take effect Oct. 31.





But it’s already been blocked by a similar lawsuit filed by 17 organizations that aid victims of domestic and sexual violence. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Oct. 10, The Associated Press reported.





The Trump administration rule would put providers in an odd legal predicament, Barber said, since federal law enacting the grant programs explicitly states eligibility for victim services cannot be based on immigration status.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4749-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-17 09:56:33.966918

(Photo by David Middleton/MU Extension Courtesy Appointment, Missouri AgrAbility Level 2 Assessor)Doug Boswell is no stranger to challenges. He grew up on a southern Oklahoma farm, helping his dad raise beef cattle, and grow forage crops. He left the farm after high school graduation, but the dream of farming again never left him.
A few years after his parents moved to Missouri, he followed so he could help them out. He and his wife, Teresa, met while working at Snap-On Tools in Springfield. But they wanted a rural acreage where they could raise cattle and hay, and hunt. In 2014, the year he turned 52, they discovered 160 acres near Stockton.
“It had 80 acres of heavily wooded, and 80 open acres for cattle – it was perfect,” he says. “The plan was retiring from my job at 55 and farming full time.”
The Boswells continued their day jobs, and spent weekends mowing their property, repairing fence, and building a hay barn. They made plans for a new home there, and within a few years, their Gelbvieh herd had grown to 65 head.
Then on a cold November day in 2017, after they finished feeding cattle, Teresa headed back to the pickup to warm up a bit. One cow took off on a dead run through an open gate. Doug knew the fences wouldn’t hold her, so he jumped on the ATV. When the cow abruptly stopped directly in his path, he braked, and the ATV flipped.
He doesn’t recall much more. He didn’t have his phone, and it was 45 minutes before Teresa discovered him. He had broken all the ribs on his left side, along with two on his right side, shattered his right shoulder, and punctured a lung.
But worst of all, he couldn’t move his legs. He was transported 60 miles by helicopter to the hospital in Springfield, where they confirmed his spine was fractured. The neurologist told Doug he’d be paralyzed for life.
He had two surgeries. After consulting neurosurgeons at Madonna Rehabilitation Hospitals in Lincoln, Nebraska; Frazier Rehab Institute in Louisville, Kentucky; Shirley Ryan AbilityLab in Chicago, and Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colorado, his prognosis remained the same: T-11 spinal cord injury. But he was more determined than ever to walk again.
Help closer to home
During two-and-a-half months of intensive physical therapy at Craig Hospital, his desire to farm never dimmed. His doctors told him about the National AgrAbility Project, and its outreach to disabled individuals through assistive technology. After returning home, he followed up with Karen Funkenbusch, Missouri AgrAbility Project director and a University of Missouri Extension professor. She visited him at the farm in March 2018 with her team, including an agricultural engineer and case managers from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (Mo-DESE) Vocational Rehabilitation.
They advised him how to adapt his pickup and tractors with hand controls and apply for an extension hoist-and-chair to lift him into his pickup bed, enabling him to attach implements. He also qualified for a track chair, a motorized wheelchair with treads to navigate the farm’s uneven terrain.
“As a patient, Doug became a strong advocate for what he needed,” Karen said.
He celebrated his successes when he could brush hog again, cut hay, and change oil in his tractors.
In the spring, Doug began using a bud box corral to vaccinate his cattle. Cows are guided into it through an alley chute, and he pulls a lever to keep them stationary. He also installed gate openers.
He and Teresa modified the plan for their 3,200-square-foot house. It would be an accessible one story with ramps and wide doorways, and an exercise room for maintaining his upper-body strength. “I use a stand-up frame to keep my bones strong,” Doug says. They moved in by October 2020.
None of these retrofits and workarounds convinced anyone that Doug was resigned to his lack of mobility. “He refused to be a sit-down farmer,” Karen said. “His goal was to walk again.”
New world of wearable exoskeletons
Seven years ago, when Karen Funkenbusch and her team conducted two on-farm assessments, they agreed Doug’s best option was a standing wheelchair. It was fully funded, along with other devices, by Missouri Vocational Rehabilitation.
He spent five winters at Brooks Rehabilitation, a neuro recovery center in Jacksonville, Florida, where he participated in clinical trials, using robotic-assisted walking devices and body-weight-supported treadmills. In 2019, for the first time since going there, his knee-jerk reflex test demonstrated an ability to move his feet. It was a game-changer.
The stage was set for him to pursue his goal of walking. Beginning in 2015, veterans had been eligible for FDA-approved wearable robotic exoskeletons. Worn over clothing, an exoskeleton is composed of an external, powered, motorized frame that fits to the limbs and body. Powered by a battery waist pack, it enables individuals with spinal cord injuries or stroke damage to stand and walk and sometimes climb stairs.

The out-of-pocket purchase of a robotic exoskeleton, at approximately $100,000, was out of reach for most until it was approved by Medicare in January 2024.
Although AgrAbility closed his case in 2018, Doug and Karen had continued their conversations about how he could take the next steps to walk again.
He filled out forms for the Indego Exo Personal and ReWalk Exoskeleton, and tried out both units.
Next, Doug was required to see his doctor, where he passed a DXA Scan for bone density, and was checked for pressure sores, small fractures in his spine, height and weight criteria, and his level of spinal cord injury.
ReWalk set up a Zoom meeting. “They wanted to see if I could complete weight transfers in and out of my chair on my own. They needed to see how flexible I was,” he said. The next step was meeting a ReWalk team at Mercy in Springfield where he would spend two hours wearing a custom-fit exoskeleton weighing 60 pounds.
With the push of a button, a wrist-worn communicator powered him from a sitting to standing position. Forearm crutches assisted with his balance.
“I just got in it and started walking,” he said. “Everything was great. It was that quick to try it out.”
After 37 supervised sessions, Doug had learned how to get up if he fell, how to go up and down stairs, and navigate curbs. He was allowed to take the exoskeleton home in February 2024, where he walked 100,000 steps on the patio and in the house.
Medicare paid for 75% of Doug’s ReWalk and his secondary insurance paid 25%.
The good and the not good enough of exoskeletons
Although his dad, Roy, and his brother-in-law Bob Arrington often help him with farm tasks, Doug was ready to be more independent. “I wanted to work on my vehicle and tractors in my shop, and carry tools back and forth,” he said.

But it’s still a work in progress. “My hands and arms aren’t free using the crutches,” he said. “I had to adapt my pickup to open up the driver’s side to get out easily.”
During haying season, Doug says it saves time to use his track chair. “It takes five minutes to get out of the ReWalk, and seven minutes to get into it,” he points out. “You can’t bend easily, or get on your knees, so it’s not feasible for some work – it isn’t quite there yet.”
His goal is walking 2,500 steps in the exoskeleton daily. “In snow and ice, or on wet tile floors, you’re not going to do it –you’ll just tip,” he says. “You’re strapped in completely, locked in. It’s a learning curve, there’s a lot of balance involved.”
On the home front, he says, “I’ve tried brushing my teeth, bending down to rinse my mouth, but I have to undo two straps, and can’t straighten back up without those fastened.”
But he can shop for groceries, pushing the cart, sit in the church pew, and get daily exercise. He’s currently working with a University of Arizona study team to tailor an exoskeleton more to the ag sector.
ReWalk batteries cost $2,500 each, and he keeps them plugged into a smart charger. “It’s worked perfectly,” he says.
ReWalk offers a 5-year warranty. “I’ve been using the heck out of it,” he says. “ReWalk gets back to me in two to five days.”
Technology advances daily
Karen Funkenbusch continues to monitor assistive technology breakthroughs for Missouri AgrAbility clients, and keeps in touch with Doug.
“Doug was not going to not walk,” she says. “When I met him, walking was his lifelong dream. We’ve gone through lots of emotions these past few years. Doug’s been willing to participate in various clinical trials to get where he is today, and AgrAbility has been a key partner.”

She adds, “Technology is changing by the moment. AgrAbility’s challenge is how to provide guidance, support, and direction to Doug and other farmers as they continue to move down this path.”
Doug’s goal this winter is wearing his ReWalk to repair a tractor with a burned out top motor. “Mechanics use roll carts all the time,” he says. “I may need help for some work if it takes two hands.”
He adds, “I’m still learning what I can do.”

From CalMatters homelessness reporter Marisa Kendall:
California cities cannot punish outreach workers for helping people who sleep on the street — even if those people live in an illegal encampment — under the terms of a new law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom this month. 
Senate Bill 634, by Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez, says cities cannot bar people or organizations from providing homeless residents with legal services, medical care or things needed for survival, such as food, water, blankets, pillows and materials to protect themselves from the elements. 
The law comes after the Bay Area city of Fremont earlier this year briefly made “aiding, abetting or concealing” an illegal homeless encampment a misdemeanor. Its city council later walked back that language — after CalMatters first reported it — but it made a lasting impression on state legislators. 

Pérez, in a statement: “The legislation provides commonsense protections for service providers, especially non-profits and faith-based ones, who are doing the work every day to assist unhoused Californians.”

But that wasn’t all the Pasadena Democrat originally wanted to do. The initial bill she introduced was much broader, and would have stopped cities from citing or arresting people for sleeping on public property. Pérez cut that controversial provision after facing pushback from cities and law enforcement agencies.
Despite that concession, San Bernardino County remained opposed to Pérez’s bill, saying it will “override local authority and restrict enforcement tools that cities and counties use to promote public safety.” 
The county recently passed an ordinance that makes it illegal to live on certain public properties. Dozens of other California cities and counties have adopted, reinstated or strengthened similar rules since summer 2024, following a U.S. Supreme Court decision that gave cities more freedom to crack down on encampments. Homelessness-related arrests and citations have soared in some places.

Let’s dive into some health care news:

Cheaper insulin: Beginning Jan. 1, roughly the 3.5 million Californians who have diabetes will have the option to purchase state-branded insulin for $11 per pen or $55 for a five-pack. The move is part of the state’s CalRx initiative to lower the price of prescription drugs for Californians. An equivalent amount of glargine, the generic version of Lantus, sells to pharmacies for more than $92, according to the governor’s office. Newsom unveiled the news Thursday, three years after he first said the state would lead efforts to make insulin more affordable. Last week Newsom also signed a law capping insulin copays to $35.

Cal State borrows for bonuses

On Thursday California State University took the first steps to request a $144 million loan from the state. Considered an uncommon financial tactic by some higher education budget experts, the money that will be used to offer one-year bonuses to faculty and staff, writes CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.
Though salaries vary across employees, the additional $144 million is roughly a 3% increase in the total pay for Cal State’s workers. Cal State will need to repay the loan, with no interest, by next July.
Despite facing fiscal pressures and projections that show Cal State must add to its deficit to repay the debt, Cal State’s interim chief financial officer, Patrick Lenz, said the system decided to take the loan “after careful deliberation.” 
Cal State’s largest union, the California Faculty Association, applauded the decision, but said more work needs to be done to bring back lecturers whose contracts were cancelled due to limited budgets.

,California,2025-10-17 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Prop. 50 doesn’t guarantee Democrats five seats. They still have to win races across California,Jim Newton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/proposition-50-guarantee-democrats-seats/,The proposed congressional maps under Proposition 50 simply create more districts with Democratic majorities. Congressional candidates will still have to convince voters they're worth electing.,"As voters weigh in on Proposition 50, which will appear on the ballot next month, the debate over the measure is complicated by one common concern and one common misconception: The concern is that the proposed redistricting moves California away from hard-won fairness in drawing congressional boundaries. The misconception is that this is a simple gift to Democrats.
It’s hard for some election reform supporters to feel good about Prop. 50. It does, after all, unravel the independent commission approach to drawing district boundaries, which California voters created in 2008 and expanded in 2010. That method is favored by many election specialists, who see it as more fair and less overtly political than having politicians choose their constituents.
Californians are rightly proud of their independent commission and its work, so it’s hard to let that go — even if temporarily. Prop. 50 would replace the current congressional map with one that creates five new majority-Democrat districts. It would remain in effect until the independent redistricting commission draws a new set based on the 2030 census, at which point California would resume its nonpartisan approach to the exercise.
Few people understand California redistricting better than Sara Sadhwani, a professor of politics at Pomona College and an ardent advocate of election rules that protect the public voice. She supports independent redistricting both as a scholar and as a participant.
When she applied for a position on the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2020, she noted that the commission “played an essential role in ensuring fair representation of all Californians by crafting district boundaries that met the needs of diverse communities.”
But Sadhwani is concerned not just with protecting California’s system, but also with the broader implications of attempts to improperly throw next year’s midterms to President Donald Trump and his Republican allies. Since Trump persuaded Texas to jimmy its congressional lines — Trump proclaimed that he is “entitled” to those now-gerrymandered seats — California has no choice but to respond, she argued.
“I’m a mom of three,” she told me last week. “I tell my kids on a regular basis that two wrongs don’t make a right. However,” she added, “I also tell them that if a bully punches you, you can defend yourself.”
Which brings us to the misconception. Although commentators do it all the time, it’s not correct to say that the new districts simply hand over new seats to Democratic candidates. What it does, rather, is create more districts with Democratic majorities.
Congressional candidates still have to do the work of collecting voters’ support and securing the office.
In some areas, of course, districts are effectively unchanged. Los Angeles is one of them, simply because L.A. is so overwhelmingly liberal. About 53% of the city’s registered voters are Democrats, compared to 17% who consider themselves Republicans. Any district boundary there will naturally produce majorities of Democrats.
Indeed, only two districts south of Santa Barbara will substantially increase their representation of Democrats: the 41st Congressional District, presently held by Republican Rep. Ken Calvert, and the 48th District, currently held by Republican Rep. Darrell Issa. In Calvert’s case, the new boundaries would leave the district heavily tilted in favor of Democrats, who would enjoy a 20-point registration advantage. In Issa’s district, the Democratic registration advantage would be just four points, but it’s still a big swing since the district presently gives Republicans a 10-point margin.
“Votes are earned, plain and simple. These districts work in the Democrats’ favor, but they don’t guarantee victory.”Sara Sadhwani, California Citizens Redistricting Commission member and Pomona College professor
What does that mean on the ground? In the case of the 41st, Democrats envision a shift with Rep. Linda Sanchez, who lives in Whittier and currently represents the 38th Congressional District, moving over to challenge Calvert, effectively placing one incumbent against another and in a district now favorable to Sanchez. Meanwhile, L.A. County Supervisor Hilda Solis, a big name in Democratic circles, has already announced her intention to run in the 38th if Prop. 50 passes, replacing Sanchez.
However, the challenge for Democrats is a little more pronounced in the 48th. Issa easily won reelection in 2024 and outperformed the registration in his district, winning by 20 points when the Republican registration advantage was 10 points. So even stripping away that advantage does not guarantee that Democrats will seize the seat.
All of this is a reminder that district line-drawing alone is not enough for political victory. Democratic districts do not necessarily add up to Democratic seats, and it’s conceivable that Calvert or Issa — especially Issa — could end up being reelected, even in a district that is more heavily stacked against Republicans.
It’s also worth noting that the same dynamics are in play, in reverse, in Texas, where better odds for Republican officeholders and candidates do not assure them of victory. The effort to maximize Republican-majority districts may have spread the party’s loyalists too thin, a phenomenon that a Boise State University political scientist described as “dummymandering.”
Again, Sadhwani emphasized that the real test of the California effort is not so much how districts are drawn but how elections are decided.
“Votes are earned, plain and simple,” she said. “These districts work in the Democrats’ favor, but they don’t guarantee victory.”
If Prop. 50 passes, it will certainly complicate Trump’s effort to steamroll the midterms by altering the lines in Texas and elsewhere, but it does not assure that Democrats can undo the damage with their counterpunch in California. It will take candidates, organizing, money and, ultimately, votes to make that happen.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/040125-Santa-Monica-Election-GA-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-17 08:56:31.480392

What changed?,Phoebe Huss,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/10/calfresh-data-privacy-california-law/,The governor has signed a law that will walk back data sharing meant to increase CalFresh recipients. The new limitations are in response to the federal government’s attempts to collect private data.,"In summary
The governor has signed a law that will walk back data sharing meant to increase CalFresh recipients. The new limitations are in response to the federal government’s attempts to collect private data.


A law that allowed the sharing of limitless amounts of personal data across the state to find people eligible for CalFresh was rescinded this week.
On Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 593 by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, a Democrat from Oakland, that forbids state and local departments from sharing sensitive personal data to increase food stamp enrollment. 
But only a year ago, it was Wicks who introduced that same data sharing initiative, to get more people enrolled in CalFresh, the state’s federally funded food assistance program. Her bill from last year, Assembly Bill 518, granted state and local public entities involved in education, crime, employment, and other areas the authority to override all state privacy laws to share data about people who could potentially get CalFresh.
CalFresh is funded by the federal government, run by the state Department of Social Services and administered locally. Over 1 in 5 Californians are food insecure. About 5 million Californians are CalFresh recipients, and the state estimates almost 2 million more are eligible and haven’t signed up. 
Around 200,000 college students in California receive CalFresh, according to the California Department of Social Services. All recipients must complete an application process many consider time-consuming and confusing. 
In May, 20,000 college students applied for CalFresh, and over half of the applications were denied, often because the student couldn’t prove they were eligible, according to the social services department. CalFresh coordinators say students are unaware of their own eligibility, making outreach important. Through data sharing, Wicks intended to identify demographic groups as well as individuals who are eligible for CalFresh, and develop marketing that would appeal to them.  
Reversing course on data sharing
In July, Wicks told a Senate committee she had changed her strategy to ensure data could not be shared beyond what is necessary for CalFresh outreach. 
She said limitations on data sharing were increasingly important as the “federal government is attempting to weaponize state data to actively prosecute a subset of Californians.” In June, the federal government shared Medicaid data with the Department of Homeland Security for the stated purpose of monitoring alleged Medicaid fraud. In September, Newsom signed Senate Bill 81, which protects medical data from immigration authorities, effective immediately.
The feds have also asked for CalFresh data. In May, the U.S. Department of Agriculture requested all state agencies send names, addresses and Social Security numbers of people who either received or applied for food assistance, as well as the calculated value of all the benefits allotted over time. The department cited an executive order by President Donald Trump as the basis for the request.
California’s Attorney General Rob Bonta and others representing Democratic states sued the Trump administration in July to prevent this data collection. On Oct. 15, a Northern California court issued a preliminary injunction temporarily blocking the transfer of CalFresh recipient data to the agriculture department.
Using data to help food stamp access
The previous law that allowed data sharing was originally written to expand paid family leave, but the bill was deactivated in September 2023. Wicks and co-author Assemblymember Corey Jackson, a Democrat from Riverside, reintroduced the bill in late August 2024, with an entirely new focus on CalFresh. Within one month, it passed both the Assembly and the Senate and was approved by the governor.
The law granted state and local entities the authority to flag Californians eligible for CalFresh, allowing them to bypass all existing state laws to do so. The law authorized departments overseeing justice, veteran services, employment, financial aid, and homelessness, as well as all three public higher education systems, to share data. Types of data included utility bills, criminal records, immigration and tax records, and health information. 
There was no limit on what kinds of information could be shared, which Bill Essayli, acting U.S. Central District Attorney and former Republican assemblymember representing the 63rd Assembly District, criticized. 
End Child Poverty California, an advocacy network fighting to eradicate poverty, supported the previous law, saying data sharing could streamline CalFresh enrollment. If the state were provided data, they argued, households wouldn’t have to submit their own verification proving their food stamp eligibility, which could speed up the process.
Though the original law was entered late in the 2024 session, it garnered several opponents, including the ACLU, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Oakland Privacy. The latter group argued to the Senate that the “preposterously broad” bill didn’t let Californians opt in or out of data sharing.
Assemblymember Alex Lee, a Democrat from San Jose, concurred with Oakland Privacy that the bill was “far too broad.” 
“I’m deeply concerned how this will impact low-income individuals,” Lee had said on the Assembly floor. “This population deserves the same privacy as everyone in this room.”
Lee as well as Essayli took issue with the gut-and-amend process that allowed the legislators to completely change the bill without approval from any Assembly policy committees. When bills are rushed in this way, Essayli said, they “can have unintended consequences.”
However, Wicks promised to add clauses limiting the bill’s scope during the following year. Four assemblymembers voted no on the bill, three of them Republicans and the last one being Lee. Newsom signed the bill into law on Sept. 28, 2024.
Clean-up leads to limitations
Wicks proposed initial drafts of the clean-up bill in early 2025. Early drafts set some limits on the scope of shareable data, but were “pretty weak,” according to Tracy Rosenberg, advocacy director for Oakland Privacy. 
Another draft of the bill removed the sharing of public data related to income and health. It also required the data only be used for CalFresh outreach, facilitating enrollment, and measuring impact. To Rosenberg, this “catch-all” language was still too broad, and still would have “justified… using the data for all kinds of things.”
Oakland Privacy collaborated with Wicks to draft this year’s bill, and Rosenberg noted Wicks was very open to protecting people’s privacy. “We think the changing political environment probably played a role,” she said.
As proven by federal probes into Medi-Cal data, Rosenberg said, California’s social services department couldn’t guarantee their data was safe from federal interference. “That was certainly a concern in 2024, but it’s a much bigger concern in 2025,” she said.
Finally, after facing Senate amendments, the last bill draft removed authorization for the data sharing entirely. The bill passed the Senate and Assembly with only two dissenting votes in total, and was signed by Newsom and chaptered into law on Oct. 13.
CalFresh data is crucial for colleges
Not all aspects of the data sharing law were rescinded this week. For example, the state social services department is still tasked with developing a methodology for estimating the rate of CalFresh participation, to be released to the public each year. 
The department will also determine the typical characteristics of people who are CalFresh-eligible, including but not limited to “race, ethnicity, preferred language, age, and location.” The department is required to develop marketing schemes that correspond to these demographics. Promoting CalFresh in underserved communities could make for more “equitable” SNAP access, Jackson said.
The department is also required to identify all public data sets that could name potential CalFresh participants.
State social services will not receive county data under this new law. But according to the people who run CalFresh programs at colleges and universities, analyzing participation is critical at the local level. 
At Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, almost 30% of all students are on CalFresh, according to Olivia Watts, program manager of CalFresh outreach at the university. She largely attributes the program’s success to their close relationship with the San Luis Obispo Department of Social Services. 
Through the data provided by that department, the university learned that half of all CalFresh applicants in the county are its students.
The data they receive is scrubbed of personal information, Watts said. It’s just numbers, which she said are integral to CalFresh functionality. “Without knowing how many students are enrolled, it makes it difficult for us to do our job, to really see, are we making progress?” 
Other university programs strive for that kind of open information. Amy Gonzales, Cal Fresh director at Chico State, has repeatedly requested CalFresh participation data from her local social services department in Butte County. They rejected the requests. 
But according to Tiffany Rowe, director of Butte County’s Department of Employment and Social Services, the department doesn’t have direct access to that data, and would have to request it from the state. If they had that data, she said, they wouldn’t deny Chico State’s access.
With access to data, Gonzales said, the CalFresh program at Chico State could improve its outreach initiatives. They could attempt to target student groups that are eligible but under-enrolled.
Gonzales would be “all about” data sharing, even across the state, as long as the information is shared with “trusted” agencies. “I think it can be very beneficial to share that eligibility data,” she said, and flag people for different social service programs based on their characteristics.
Still, Gonzales manages to conduct outreach without countywide data. At Chico State, she partners with some of the college’s academic programs and workplaces to find students eligible for CalFresh.
College students are eligible for food assistance based on their participation in employment training programs. Certain majors count toward this criteria. Students are often unaware of their eligibility, which is why targeted outreach is important, Gonzales said.
But though she’d appreciate data on eligible people, “I do have concerns with data sharing, given the current administration’s priorities and what they have requested,” she said.
Watts and Gonzales both help students at their universities with CalFresh applications. They both said they wish that all college students were automatically eligible for the program.
Under the new law, counties can continue to harvest data about the efficacy of their own CalFresh programs. They’re just prevented from sharing data on eligible individuals with the state. But interagency relationships at local levels, Watts said, need to be protected.
“We’ve had a lot of success… because of our ability to share data, and communicate in these ways, and problem-solve together,” Watts said.

Gavin Newsom signed five laws advancing reparations for the descendants of enslaved people in California, but he vetoed five others.

Gov. Gavin Newsom signed five laws advancing reparations for the descendants of enslaved people in California, but he vetoed five others. It’s a mixed record two years after the California Reparations Task Force issued its seminal report.


Lawmakers and advocates are regrouping to determine how they will move forward in the effort to ensure reparative justice for Black Californians after Gov. Gavin Newsom this week signed — and vetoed — a slate of reparations measures. 
Among the key bills signed into law was one to create the Bureau for Descendants of American Slavery, which will create a structure for reparations. San Diego Democratic Sen. Akilah Weber Pierson authored the legislation, which establishes the bureau under California’s Civil Rights Department and will include a division of genealogy, education and outreach, and legal affairs. 
Newsom also approved Senate Bill 437, which allocates up to $6 million for the California State University system to research methods for verifying descendants of people enslaved in the U.S. who wish to access benefits. 
But he vetoed five other reparations measures backed by the California Legislative Black Caucus, including one that would have allowed colleges to prioritize descendants of American slavery and another to initiate a restitution process for victims of racially motivated eminent domain. 
In his veto messages, Newsom said the legislation was “unnecessary” and cited fiscal challenges, respectively. In a message vetoing a bill that would have dedicated at least 10% of a state-backed home loan program for descendants of enslaved people, Newsom cited “legal risks” and potential threats to federal funding. 
Legal scholars and some members of the state’s Reparations Task Force — a first-in-the nation commission created after the murder of George Floyd — have previously noted that a 1996 ballot measure, Proposition 209, that prohibits state institutions from considering race, sex, color, or ethnicity, poses challenges to enacting reparations-based laws. Opponents of reparations-aimed laws have threatened to sue under Prop. 209, which has been upheld multiple times by state courts.  
“We have been able to deliver some significant wins with the assistance of our governor,” said Weber Pierson, who chairs the California Legislative Black Caucus, in an interview with CalMatters. “That being said, of course some of our bills were vetoed. You never get everything you want.”
Those bills were among the 16 “Road to Repair” priority measures that the caucus introduced this year based on recommendations from the Reparations Task Force. 
After two years of study, the commission released a seminal report in 2023 detailing California’s history of enslavement and racially discriminatory policies, and issued over 100 recommendations to address the harms inflicted on Black Californians. 
Since then, the Black Caucus has worked to implement those proposals. Newsom last year signed six of the caucus’ 14 priority bills, one of which required the state to apologize for perpetuating slavery. 
Weber Pierson said the caucus plans to regroup in a couple of weeks to discuss its direction for 2026.
“With any veto message, we need to go back and see if there’s a different way in which we can approach a solution to the problem,” she said. “A veto is never, in my opinion, a ‘no.’ It may be a ‘no, for now.’ It may be just a ‘no’ this year. And it may be a ‘no’ but let’s try something different.”
Lisa Holder, a civil rights attorney and former task force member, said she has been much more focused on the wins than the losses. 
“This moment is historic,” she said. “African Americans have been fighting for reparations since emancipation. This is a significant step that California has now undertaken to make reparations into a concrete reality. They are building a home for harm repair and they are scaffolding it with the power and the seal of approval of the California government.”

As for Newsom’s vetoes, Holder said it won’t take one legislative cycle to fix 400 years of harm. 
“This is a long-term process and we have a long view,” she said. “(Newsom) was opening the door for us to recraft the bills, restyle them and make them stronger so that they can withstand any legal attacks.” 
Some reparations advocacy groups that want to see California move more swiftly toward harm repair formally opposed the new laws, arguing that the research study and bureau will only create crippling implementation delays. 
“This is delay by design,” said Chris Lodgson, a spokesperson for Coalition for a Just and Equitable California, a grassroots advocacy group. 
After the governor’s vetoes, he said he believes his coalition can offer a more effective pathway, rooted in solutions that are written and formulated by community members. 
“We think we can start the repair sooner rather than later,” he said. “A better way forward would not need additional years of study and setting up more government.”

Timothy Galluzi, the state’s chief information officer and executive director of the governor’s technology office, referenced the policy Thursday while answering questions from state legislators about the Aug. 24 cyber security incident that crippled many state operations for weeks.
“We have $7 million coverage,” he said, “and we believe that level of coverage is going to be ample to cover the direct expenses from this.”
The direct expenses so far are “well under that,” Galluzi added.
Assemblymember Tracy Brown May, a Democrat from Las Vegas, sought assurance that details about the cyber attack would be released to lawmakers and the public at some point. She said constituents have reached out to her wanting to know details about the impact of the cyber attack, including when the attack was first initiated, how long the attackers went undetected, what departments were affected, whether a ransom was demanded, and whether it was paid.
Galluzi said a report will be made publicly available, though he cautioned that “some details” might not be available “for quite some time.” The governor’s office has made similar comments when asked for additional details about the cyber attack.
As for the impacted data, Galluzi described it as “a very incredibly small subset of internal data.” He did not elaborate.
The Interim Finance Committee on Thursday gave Galluzi’s office approval to accept $313,700 in federal grant funding, which will be used to create a shared technical threat analysis and alert management tool for use statewide. Galluzi said the improvements will help bring better security to the executive branch and be expanded outward to rural partners.
The University of Nevada Las Vegas, last year received similar grant money to explore the feasibility of a statewide security operations center (SOC).
2023 funding request revisited
State Sen. Rochelle Nguyen, a Democrat from Las Vegas, grilled Galluzi about a 2023 funding request by the state’s office of cyber defense coordination, which at the time was in the Department of Public Safety but has since moved to the Governor’s office.
The cyber defense coordination team requested $34.7 million to establish a statewide SOC.
Nguyen noted that the funding request was not included in Gov. Joe Lombardo’s recommended budget, and she asked Galluzi and his co-presenters whether a SOC might have helped prevent or mitigate the recent cyber attack.
Galluzi responded by saying that, while he believes a SOC is imperative, “it requires buy-in from all participants” and that the need for  initial upfront capital “kind of takes away from that.”
“The way we’re trying to build it right now, we’re attempting to use the federal opportunities that are made available to us through the state and local cyber security grant program and build it with a grassroots effort with incredibly willing and able participants,” he said.
Adam Miller, deputy director of the office of information security and cyber defense, answered Nguyen’s question more directly, saying, “You can say yes. You can say no. You can argue it either way.”
He continued, “I think what we do now is that the security infrastructure we have in place, with the resources we have at our disposal, caught this security incident early enough where we were able to triage, we were able to prevent, and then we were able to rebuild and reconstitute.”
Additional resources are always helpful, he added.
When asked by Nguyen if the governor’s technology office plans on revisiting a request for a statewide SOC, Galluzi said yes.
Galluzi also said his office is working with the governor’s office to look at ways to strengthen cybersecurity more immediately, since the legislature is not set to convene a regular session until 2027.
Miller said a consultant has been hired to conduct a “top down review” of security policies.
“Everything that affects cyber security policy in the State of Nevada is going to be under scrutiny,” he said. “That is going to be the first step on how we progress toward building a more robust security policy.”
Earlier this year legislation was introduced by Las Vegas Republican Assemblymember Toby Yurek to create a state SOC. The bill got a hearing in the Assembly Government Affairs Committee, but was then referred to the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, where funding determinations and allocations are made, and which is colloquially referred to as “where bills go to die.” No further action was taken on the bill.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/statebldgdoublecropped-1024x696.jpg,,,2025-10-17 08:56:31.480392

New Mexico is enlisting the help of hunters across New Mexico to be on the lookout for the parasitic fly that could devastate livestock. (Courtesy USDA)Several New Mexico agencies are encouraging hunters across the state to be on the lookout for New World screwworm, a parasitic fly that could threaten livestock, after Mexican authorities in recent weeks detected the insect 70 miles from the Texas border.
The New Mexico Game and Fish Department, along with the state Agriculture Department and Livestock Board, issued a joint statement Thursday telling hunters to check harvested game and live animals for evidence of the screwworm, calling it a “serious threat.”
The movement of the parasitic fly, previously eradicated from the U.S. for the last several decades, has disrupted international cattle trade through New Mexico, Arizona and Texas in the last several months. The screwworm’s name references the maggot’s behavior of burrowing into the flesh of a living animal, sometimes causing serious or fatal damage to livestock, wildlife and pets. 
New Mexico border officials say New World screwworm outbreak hitting state hard

State Veterinarian Samantha Holeck told Source New Mexico in a phone interview Thursday that three recent detections in Mexico, and the prospect of several more weeks at least of warm weather, prompted the state to ask hunters to be vigilant. 
“It’s better for us to get word out to [hunters] sooner than later. We still have a decent amount of warm weather ahead of us,” she said. “The more people we can inform and have them on the lookout, especially in the more rural parts of the state, the better.” 
The detections all occurred in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon, which borders southeast Texas, since late September. Authorities found one screwworm on Sept. 21 about 70 miles from the border, according to an announcement from the United States Agriculture Department. 


Contact information for hunters who encounter possible New World screwworm:
New Mexico Department of Game and Fish: (888) 248-6866 or ispa@dgf.nm.gov
New Mexico Livestock Board: (505) 841-6161
New Mexico Department of Agriculture: (575) 646-9191 or the Agriculture Reporting Hotline
New Mexico State University: Visit any of the County Extension Offices


Since then, amid a federal government shutdown, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins has posted on social media about other detections in Nuevo Leon. Her most recent post was Oct. 11 about a detection about 390 miles from the Texas border; the other post Oct. 6 was about a detection 170 miles from the Texas border. 
The state agencies are asking hunters who encounter possible screwworms to take a GPS location, photos of the wound, larvae, animal and, if they can, safely collect a sample. 
“Using gloves or tweezers, place several larvae into a sealed container (small jar or plastic vial) with 70% alcohol,” the agencies advise. 
Reports should be sent immediately to Game and Fish, Agriculture or the Livestock Board. They urge hunters not to eat, handle or transport the animal that could be infected.
Hunters should be on the lookout for maggots on living or very recently deceased animals. Common sites are wounds or body openings like the nose or genitals, according to the agency. 
“Your reports are critical for early detection and rapid response. Quick action could protect wildlife and livestock across the state,” the agencies wrote in the news release.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nws-larva-scaled-e1760650112335-1024x959.jpg,,,2025-10-17 08:56:31.480392
,California,2025-10-17 12:06:00+00:00,CalMatters,CalMatters shined a light on struggling birthing centers. Newsom just signed a law to help them,Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/10/birth-centers-law-impact/,Birth centers are disappearing in California. A newly-signed law expands support for labor and delivery services to address the problem.,"In summary
Birth centers are disappearing in California. A newly-signed law expands support for labor and delivery services to address the problem.


Women in California today have fewer places to give birth than they did a decade ago. Legislation signed this week by Gov. Gavin Newsom aims to create more options for them by making it easier for birth centers to operate outside of hospitals.
The “Freedom to Birth Act” by Assemblymember Mia Bonta, a Democrat from Oakland, streamlines burdensome licensure requirements that have prevented birth centers from receiving state approval. Without licensure, birth centers frequently can’t contract with health insurers or Medi-Cal. That leaves patients who can’t pay cash unable to use midwives or birth centers.
The legislation was introduced and signed following reporting by Cal Matters over the past two years revealing that vast areas of California have no hospitals or birth centers following dozens of closures. In some areas, pregnant people may have to drive two hours to give birth at a hospital.
“The fact that (CalMatters is) quoted in every letter of support that was sent to the Legislature and to the governor’s office asking for his signature says a lot,” said Sandra Poole, a lobbyist with the Western Center on Law and Poverty, which co-sponsored the legislation. “The information you provided was foundational in the work that we did in this area.”
Birth centers, which are most commonly owned and operated by midwives, specialize in low-risk, out-of-hospital births. Research shows that midwife-led deliveries at birth centers are safe and lead to fewer interventions like cesarean sections.
Over the past three years, at least 20 birth centers have closed in California, according to CalMatters reporting and the California chapter of the American Association of Birth Centers. Of the roughly 30 facilities left, only four are licensed by the state public health department. 
The birth center closures come at the same time that hospitals have closed dozens of labor and delivery wards. Nearly 60 maternity wards have closed since 2012, according to a CalMatters database.
The new law removes a mandate that birth centers operate within 30-minutes of a hospital with labor and delivery services and removes duplicative Medi-Cal requirements. The measure passed unanimously in the Assembly and the Senate.
“Red tape should never stand in the way of proven solutions to deliver affordable and accessible healthcare for Californians. By signing (the law), our state has taken a much-needed step to address the maternal health crisis,” Bonta said in a statement.
Survey: More than half of women consider midwives for birth
The new law is a crucial step toward making birth centers and out-of-hospital births more accessible, advocates say.
“When we first started looking at this issue there were 10 licensed birth centers on the state website. Then you start calling folks and it became six, and now we’re down to four,” Poole said. “It’s going in the wrong direction for sure.”
Poole said she’s hopeful the relaxed regulations will encourage more birth centers to open and allow those that have given up on licensure to try again. Doing so would also make the services more accessible for low-income families. Medi-Cal, the state insurance program for people with disabilities and low-income people, pays for half of all births in the state.
Most births happen in hospitals, but midwives deliver a growing number of babies in the state. Planned out-of-hospital births increased by 30% over the past decade even as birth rates overall declined, according to data from the Medical Board of California. 
A 2018 survey by the California Health Care Foundation found that more than one-third of pregnant patients would be interested in having a midwife for a future birth. That interest was highest among Black women. More than 50% of women who wanted a midwife at birth said they didn’t use one because insurance wouldn’t pay for it.
Cindy Haag, a licensed midwife, has operated Pacifica Family Maternity Center in Berkeley for 13 years. In the beginning she tried to get licensed thinking it would be easy. Instead, Haag said the process was onerous and confusing. The health department didn’t even know what a birth center license was when she applied, Haag said, a story that multiple midwives who have attempted licensure have told CalMatters. The application was denied.
Without licensure she couldn’t take Medi-Cal patients.
“It’s really sad because it changes the diversity and the accessibility,” Haag said.
In recent years, Haag has come to an agreement with a local Medi-Cal plan to take some of their patients who want to give birth with a midwife outside of the hospital. Still, without full licensure, the birth center is limited on how much it gets reimbursed for Medi-Cal patients.
“We are doing the right thing because we care about accessibility, but it’s not for our financial gain,” Haag said.

(Annie Knox, Utah News Dispatch)With the days she walked on eggshells in her own home now firmly behind her, a Utah survivor of domestic violence breathed a big sigh on Thursday. 
“It’s so relieving,” she said in an interview. “Now I just have to focus on myself, my healing journey, just picking up the pieces every single day.”


 Domestic violence resources

Help for people in abusive relationships is available in Utah:

Utah Domestic Violence Coalition: A confidential statewide, 24-hour domestic violence hotline can be reached at 1-800-897-LINK (5465)
YWCA Women in Jeopardy program: 801-537-8600
Utah child abuse and neglect hotline: 1-855-323-DCFS (3237)
National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233



Alivia, who gave Utah News Dispatch permission to identify her by her first name, said police and prosecutors in Salt Lake City worked quickly and carefully to arrest and prosecute her perpetrator.
But Salt Lake County’s top prosecutor acknowledges that isn’t always the case. Many victims of domestic violence don’t have a positive experience with the justice system, District Attorney Sim Gill said, and many abusers are not brought to justice. 
On Thursday, Gill said he wants to change that. He announced his office is training police throughout the county on how to ensure they gather all the evidence needed and how to interview those traumatized by abuse, without doing further harm. 
He believes the instruction on best practices will help his office file more criminal charges without the added step of asking police to go back and gather more evidence.  
“One of the things I want to minimize is the delay between an incident, and us filing,” Gill said in an interview. “Part of that is that if I’m sending this case back for further investigation, the urgency of the moment is being compromised.”
A grant from the U.S. Department of Justice – providing $500,000 over three years – is helping cover the cost of the training for five police departments: Salt Lake City, Riverton, Draper, West Jordan, and South Jordan, according to Gill’s office. But a longtime investigator working with the office is also leading trainings for other agencies upon request. 
In South Jordan, detectives have received an early round of training that’s reinforced the effects of trauma, including a “freeze” response, said Lt. Adrian Montelongo with South Jordan police. 
To help those reporting abuse feel more comfortable speaking with investigators, the department has been conducting interviews with them either at their homes or another space of their choice, and with victim advocates present, he said. 
“They’re dispatchable,” Montelongo said of victim advocates. “Especially if they ask for one, we will call them out.” 
On a statewide level, Gill said Utah has taken positive steps in addressing domestic violence in recent years. Under a 2023 state law, he noted, police must ask victims a series of questions that can help determine how much danger they’re in. 
Days after officers’ deaths, Utah rolls out data on risk of domestic violence turning lethal

The surveys known as the lethality assessment protocol have also helped standardize how officers across the state investigate reports of domestic violence, Gill said. 
But another state initiative has stalled. This year the Legislature did not fund a budget request to cover forensic exams for victims of attempted strangulation. Advocates say the exams are important because they can provide evidence for prosecutions and can reveal internal injuries or signs of a future stroke, even when there are no obvious external wounds, which also makes clear whether further medical care is needed.  
“They should definitely put funding back into that,” Alivia told Utah News Dispatch. 
At a news conference on Thursday, she and Gill urged Utahns to routinely check on anyone they suspect is being abused, ask how they can help, and recommend charting out a safety plan. Gill said it’s tempting to assume people in abusive relationships would simply leave, but there are many reasons why they might stay, including cultural, religious and financial factors. 
“You’re going to always have the whys, the what ifs, the ‘What I could have done?’” Alivia said after the news conference. “I still get emotional about it, obviously. But time – that’s all you need. Time will heal.”

Auburn University officials said in a statement Thursday they did not have a comment on the lawsuit.
The lawsuit names as defendants Auburn University President Christopher Roberts; Chris Hardman, a behavioral threat assessment coordinator for the university; Clarence JC Stewart, assistant vice president of campus safety and compliance; Scott Forehand, the director of compliance, investigations and Security for Auburn University; Jason Hicks, the dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Tami Poe, a senior manager of human resources at Auburn. 
On Sept. 11, Hale shared her thoughts about Kirk’s death on Facebook.
“I do not mourn oppressors. I do not show them empathy. I don’t give a damn about evil racist, fascist, misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, mediocre, white men who claim to be christian and then do everything Christ would not do on Earth,” the post said.
On Sept. 17, Roberts said in a statement posted to social media that multiple employees were fired for their social media posts. The school did not give a specific number. 
Hale alleges in her complaint that the same day the statement was posted, she was notified by Hardman to coordinate a meeting with himself and Forehand.
According to the complaint, during the meeting, Hale was questioned by Hardman and Forehand about her online posting and was asked “how students who were in the University’s Turning Point USA chapter would feel about her comments.”
Turning Point USA is a non-profit organization founded by Kirk that advocates for right-wing policies on high school, college and university campuses.
Hale also alleges in the complaint that Hardman and Forehand asked how she would interact with white male students who had the same views as Kirk and if she had any weapons or intent to harm anyone who is a member of Auburn’s Turning Point USA chapter.
Hale told the two that she was unaware of the university’s Turning Point chapter and that she didn’t have any weapons. 
According to the filing, Forehand and Harding did not signal that the meeting would go to the university’s human resources department and that they did not find that Hale was a threat to campus safety.
However, two days later on Sept. 19, Hale said Poe requested a meeting with her and Hicks.
Hale said in the complaint that she asked for the meeting to be postponed until she could secure counsel to represent her, to which Poe said no matter when the meeting was, Hale would be placed on administrative leave.
Hale alleges that on Sept. 23, Poe called her to say she was not allowed to have counsel present at the meeting. 
The next day around 3 p.m., Hale had a virtual meeting with Poe and Hicks. According to the complaint, during the meeting Hicks told Hale the university wanted to end her employment and gave her a 21-day window to consider a severance agreement.
The complaint said Hale has not been allowed to return to work and has been banned from campus by Stewart.
Hale said in a Facebook post on Thursday that she was also fired by The University of Alabama shortly after her social media post about Kirk “without a formal investigation, hearing, or opportunity to respond.”
A message seeking comment was left with The University of Alabama Thursday.
“Both institutions have tried to silence my voice. I reject these efforts. I remain steadfast in defending my right to speak truth to power and to challenge white supremacy, misogyny, and injustice—especially within academic spaces,” Hale said in the post.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Auburn-University-03-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-17 08:56:31.480392
,California,2025-10-17 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s chronic deficit looms again as Newsom prepares his last state budget,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/california-chronic-deficit-budget/,Gov. Gavin Newsom may run out of reserves and other ways to paper over his last state budget deficit before he eventually runs for president.,"It seems like just yesterday that Gov. Gavin Newsom and state legislators enacted a state budget that papered over a $20 billion gap between income and outgo while blaming President Donald Trump for their fiscal dilemma.
It was, in fact, less than four months ago that Newsom signed the $321 billion, 2025-26 budget, saying, “As we confront Donald Trump’s economic sabotage, this budget agreement proves California won’t just hold the line — we’ll go even further. It’s balanced, it maintains substantial reserves, and it’s focused on supporting Californians — slashing red tape and catapulting housing and infrastructure development, preserving essential healthcare services, funds universal pre-K, and cuts taxes for veterans.”
Trump, however, had nothing to do with what state officials have described as a “structural deficit,” meaning that spending encased in current law outstrips revenue expectations. Rather, it stems from what officialdom later acknowledged as a $165 billion error in revenue projections in 2022 that fueled Newsom’s boast of having a $97.5 billion surplus. That, in turn, resulted in a sharp increase in spending.
When the surplus was exposed as a phantom, the state was stuck with a chronic income/outgo gap that persists. To cover it this year, Newsom and legislators tapped emergency reserves, borrowed money from the state treasury’s special funds, postponed some spending and engaged in some accounting gimmickry.
On Thursday, the Legislative Analyst Office pegged the budget’s total borrowing — on and off the books — at $21 billion.
Although this budget is less than 4 months old, the annual budgetary cycle will soon begin anew.
The Legislature’s budget analyst, Gabe Petek, will issue his annual overview of the state’s finances in a few weeks, followed in December by the Department of Finance’s finalization of parameters and Newsom’s decisions on how to spend what money he assumes the state will have, and in January by the introduction of the first draft of a 2026-27 plan.
It will be Newsom’s final budget before his second and final term as governor ends 14 months hence and he very likely embarks on a campaign for the White House. 
All indications point to another year of coping with a multibillion-dollar deficit. Major revenues have been running a few billion dollars ahead of estimates in the current budget, but not nearly enough to markedly shrink the structural deficit.
“Despite the recent revenue strength, California’s budget condition remains fragile,” the state Assembly’s top budget advisor, Jason Sisney, says in a memo this week. “There are many indications that an investment bubble from the so-called ‘artificial intelligence’ industry is fueling recent tax revenue gains.”
Sisney correctly added that “Bubbles can lead to dramatic state tax revenue declines when they burst.” That’s what happened about a quarter-century ago when the “dot com” bubble burst, creating a large state budget deficit.
Having finessed the state’s chronic deficit over the last three years, Newsom and legislators have run up billions of dollars in debt by tapping special funds and must also account for spending deferrals and other maneuvers as they write his final budget. They also must contend with the effects of depending heavily on emergency funds — including $7.1 billion in the current budget —to cover shortfalls.
“Most of the state’s rainy day fund has been used to balance the last two budgets, and the state’s large cash balances largely are unavailable to help fix a structural deficit in the General Fund,” Sisney observes.
The bottom line is that if revenues don’t increase quickly and sharply, Newsom and legislators will face the same chronic deficit, plus added pressure to offset cuts in federal funds for education, social and medical services that Trump and Congress are making. What they do, or don’t do, will accompany Newsom as he plunges into national politics.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/051425_MayBudgetRevise_FG_CM_11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-17 08:56:31.480392

Harris said Thursday he is worried about Alabama families enrolled in WIC, a food assistance program for women and babies.(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)Alabama’s top public health official said Thursday he is worried about funding for a food assistance program for pregnant women and babies amid the federal government shutdown.
State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris said Thursday morning at the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) meeting that 110,000-112,000 families use USDA’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children – known as WIC. The funding allows babies to get specialty formula, essentially prescribed by a nutritionist, that their families would not otherwise be able to afford. 
“We spend about $110 to $120 million per year that goes straight to Alabama grocery stores and food retailers to supply food for these women and babies,” Harris said. “This is not a food giveaway program. It’s a clinical nutrition program.”
Because of the uncertainties around funding, Harris said ADPH changed the enrollment renewals from once every three months to every month. WIC is funded through the federal government, and should be fully funded through October, using leftover ADPH money from fiscal year 2025 and short term funds from USDA. However, Harris is uncertain past this month.
“There was a call with state health officials on Tuesday with the National WIC Association. They indicated that they had written confirmation that some state funding could be used and then be eligible to be reimbursed,” Harris said. “Certainly, we would always take state funding, if there were some out there, and use it.

On Sept. 16, the Massachusetts Legislature held a hearing about legislation to prohibit deployment of the National Guard to foreign combat in the absence of congressional authorization. 
A similar bill to protect our Vermont National Guard, H.355, was introduced earlier this year. It is vital that the Guard be deployed to participate in conflict only if there is a congressional declaration of war. We are urging all Vermont legislators to support this measure.
Action Corps is a grassroots initiative to campaign for U.S. policies to save lives affected by violent conflict and climate change. As a member of Action Corps, I feel that the protection of our neighbors and family members in the Vermont National Guard is of the most urgent importance.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  David Moats: Looking beyond the Vermont bubble.","This commentary is by David Moats, of Salisbury. He is an editorial page editor emeritus of the Rutland Herald, where he won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for a series of editorials on Vermont’s civil union law.


The “No Kings” protests planned for Saturday are likely to be huge. At the same time, Vermonters sometimes wonder if their expression of opposition to Trump administration travesties really matters. After all, we live in the Vermont bubble, as it is called, where opposition to President Donald Trump long ago established itself as safely conventional.
But for many reasons, it matters. 
First, rallying in protest with friends and neighbors is a morale booster for participants. It is an uplifting reminder to ourselves that cruelty and authoritarianism will not go unchallenged, and it helps maintain the momentum of the movement.
Second, when Vermonters turn out by the thousands, they send a message to Vermont officeholders. Thus, Gov. Phil Scott knew that most Vermonters would support his view that Trump’s use of the National Guard to counter bogus threats was unconstitutional. Attorney General Charity Clark knows that Vermonters are likely to back her many lawsuits seeking to hinder the Trump administration’s lawless actions.

Third, activism in Vermont is a sign to people elsewhere that they are not alone. If protesters in Chicago or Portland, Oregon, encounter vindictive, punitive action, they will know that others are on their side.
Fourth, protests in varied regions around the country serve notice to the powers that be that opposition is widespread, present in all regions and all social classes, and is likely to grow, rather than fade, as their abuses worsen.
So as Vermonters prepare their placards and unfurl their flags for Saturday, they can reassure themselves that they are part of something large and important. The delusional rhetoric from Trump asserting that protesters hate America must be countered by demonstrations showing that to oppose authoritarianism is to express a deeply felt love for America and its democratic values.
At the same time, it is important for Vermonters to look beyond the bubble and not to bask too serenely in the glow of their own virtue. Among Trump supporters nationwide are millions whose views have been shaped by distorted news coverage and fearmongering online content. They hold their views honestly, even if their views have been shaped by the dishonesty of propagandistic news coverage.
On a rafting trip out West this summer, a family of Trump supporters was among our fellow rafters. There was little overt political discussion during our days on the river or in camp during the evenings — no one wanted to get into it out there where we were stuck with each other for six days.
But conversations that I overheard indicated that some of my fellow rafters viewed “antifa” — the antifascist activists who have had a presence in Portland, Oregon, among other places — and Black Lives Matter as serious threats to the social order. Trump’s incipient fascism or the racism that inspired Black Lives Matter did not seem as alarming to them as the disorder caused by liberal activism.
Yet some things were apparent to me during those days outside the Vermont bubble. My fellow rafters were not wicked people. They were good people. There was a large family group, including grandparents, offspring, spouses and grandchildren. They cared about each other and about us. Everyone hung together to make the rafting trip a success. 
My sister, her husband and I may have been political outliers, but no ill will was in evidence. I was hoping that, if they sensed that our backgrounds or political leanings were different from theirs, they would see that we were good people, too. In a real sense, we were all in it together — in rafts together, in the waters of one of America’s wildest rivers together — and we were depending on each other. 
In this moment of crisis, it brings to mind President Abraham Lincoln’s words on the brink of the Civil War: “We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies.”
Trump would have us be enemies. Instead, protesters on Saturday ought to recall how the fire hoses and police dogs of Alabama created new friends for the civil rights movement of the 1960s. 
The dignity and composure, the joy and strength of the protesters won over far more people than acts of vandalism or anger on their part might have done.
The provocative and violent rhetoric of Trump and his henchmen have heightened the danger of public protest, but danger during the Civil Rights era was also extreme. Bombings, murders and beatings were everyday occurrences. Standing up to oppression was not easy, but ultimately, courage and faith in the rule of law frustrated the lawless oppressors.
Civility and joy among protesters on Saturday would be yet another step toward frustrating the demagogic program of the Trump administration. It won’t happen in one day, but over time, opposition to Trump could prove to be a massive unstoppable force. 
Even within the Vermont bubble that is an important message to send.

Indiana's utility consumer counselor didn't join the deal — and said she'd oppose it.","AES Indiana responds to trees downed during storms in late June 2023. (Photo courtesy of filing with Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission)AES Indiana slashed its $293-million base rate increase request by more than half — to $91 million — in a settlement agreement filed with state regulators on Wednesday.
“We have a deep commitment to operating efficiently and keeping rates as low as possible,” utility President Brandi Davis-Handy said in a news release. “Throughout this process, we’ve listened to stakeholder feedback and evaluated tradeoffs we will make for future investments while minimizing the financial impact of delivering safe and reliable electric service.”
The proposed deal is with Indiana University and the city of Indianapolis, plus a variety of companies: Allison Transmission, Eli Lilly & Co., Rolls-Royce, Walmart and more. Kroger wasn’t part of the deal but has no objection to it, according to the filing.
The matter is before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, and won’t be decided until next year.
Indiana Utility Consumer Counselor Abby Gray and her office, as well as pro-ratepayer group Citizens Action Coalition, didn’t sign on.
“The settlement agreement filed by AES and other parties shows the utility’s initial request was inflated and unnecessary,” Gray said in a Thursday news release. “The OUCC stands by its initial recommendations for a reduction from current rates and will oppose the utility’s settlement agreement.”
State’s ratepayer advocate recommends denial of AES’ $200M proposed increase

Her office recommended last month that the IURC deny AES Indiana’s request — and, instead, said a $21 million cut to current rates is “warranted” based on the case‘s evidence and the law.
Citizens Action Coalition, meanwhile, called the proposal “unbalanced.”
“We will vigorously oppose this unfair and unaffordable deal and do everything we can to protect the residents of Indianapolis from yet another large utility bill increase,” Executive Director Kerwin Olson said in a Thursday news release. “Hoosiers have had enough with AES Indiana’s poor service, soaring bills, and backroom deals. It’s time for the IURC to send a message and restore affordability and accountability at our out-of-control monopoly utilities.”
 The proposed settlement
AES Indiana provides retail electric service to more than 530,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in Indianapolis, as well as portions of other central Indiana communities surrounding Marion County
The agreement would lower the revenue requirement AES Indiana seeks from $2.1 billion to $2 billion, and lists other changes — to the cost of capital, fuel oil inventory, depreciation, vegetation management and more — that go into the revenue figure.
The utility also agreed not to implement new base rates arising out of its next case until 2030, after the current base rate request is carried out.
And the company would delay the start of its next proposed transmission, distribution and storage improvement charge plan until 2028. The current plan enters its final year in 2026.
“For over a decade, AES Indiana has consistently ranked among the lowest residential rates in the state, and that’s not by chance,” Davis-Handy said. “Despite rising costs, we have been disciplined in our planning through measures like our operations and maintenance costs holding flat for the past five years.”
Some of the agreement’s terms affect specific parties, like streetlight provisions involving the city of Indianapolis or discussions about “ways to ameliorate the peaks associated with Rolls-Royce’s engine testing.”
Story continues below.
46258_AESIN_Joint Motion for Leave to File Settlement Agreement_101525
 
The document goes on to tackle the cost of service and rate design.
“The Settling Parties agree that rates should be designed in order to allocate the revenue requirement to and among AES Indiana’s customer classes in a fair and reasonable manner,” it reads.
The subsidy received by residential customers would be “mitigated” by 15%, according to the agreement. Fixed charges would stay at their current, regulator-approved levels: $12.50 monthly at 325 kilowatt hours or less, and $17 monthly for residents using more power.
Large secondary service customers would pay a $128 charge and a demand charge of $28.50.
Citizens Action Coalition said the deal would result in residential customers receiving a 6.51% base rate increase, whereas primary and secondary classes of large commercial and industrial customers would “only” receive a 3.19% and 4.12% increase, respectively.
The advocacy organization also critiqued the arrangement for “fail(ing) to adequately address” the “egregious and prolonged” problems tens of thousands of customers experienced after AES rolled out a new billing system in 2023.
Regulators can approve, deny, or modify any settlement agreement they consider. But the document says that — if the IURC doesn’t accept the proposed deal in its entirety — it’ll be null, void and withdrawn upon written notice of “unacceptable modifications” by any of the settling parties.
Data centers not part of the equation
AES Indiana also filed rebuttals this month to earlier criticisms.
In their response to the initial increase ask, OUCC witnesses labeled the utility “inattentive” and “indifferent” when it comes to affordability.
“While the OUCC may disagree with the Company on policy matters, the suggestion that differing viewpoints constitute wrongdoing should be rejected,” Davis-Handy said in her rebuttal.
She argued that AES Indiana can’t control much of the increase it seeks.
“Rate reviews are driven by facts and require sound analysis,” Davis-Handy said. “This is necessary because the price charged for retail electric service is underpinned by the cost incurred to provide the service, and the reality is that much of the cost incurred by the Company to provide service is outside the Company’s control.”

She pointed to the utility’s “relatively flat” non-fuel, non-labor operations and management expenses as proof of “reasonable and sound management of costs that are under the Company’s control.”
Davis-Handy also rejected claims that power-hungry data centers are behind the rate increase request, testifying that AES Indiana doesn’t have any data center customers right now and that data center load is “in no way associated with” the proposed hike.
The OUCC pledged to submit opposition testimony “on a future date to be determined.” The settlement agreement includes a request to change the case’s filing schedule, but notes the “non-settling parties” haven’t agreed to the revisions.
Parties will have the opportunity to file testimony in support or opposition to the deal, after which the IURC will hold an evidentiary hearing.
AES Indiana hopes regulators will finalize the case in the spring, so that it can implement new rates by June 1, 2026.

(Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images)It seems everything is political these days, and the Super Bowl halftime show is no different.
I know nothing about Bad Bunny and doubt I have ever heard a song of his. But it’s clear he is a global phenomenon who many are looking forward to watching, my daughter included. And he will draw new audience members from international markets.
But he has struck a negative chord with some Americans.
Since the announcement, Turning Point USA has created an alternative “family-friendly” halftime show with no officially announced acts. And there is a petition with almost 23,000 signatures urging the National Football League to jettison Bad Bunny in favor of country star George Strait.
I want to add my vote against Bad Bunny, though it has nothing to do with his native language, Spanish. I simply think it’s time for the show to feature another genre of music beyond rap, R&B and hip hop, which has dominated the halftime entertainment in recent memory.
I’m not categorically against it. I loved Bruno Mars’ show in 2014 and Usher in 2024.
But take a look at the list of artists from the last six years: Kendrick Lamar, Usher, Rihanna, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, The Weeknd, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, Ludacris, Lil John, 50 Cent, Travis Scott and more.
Most of those shows were produced by rap mogul Jay-Z and his entertainment company Roc Nation. Apple Music has also sponsored the show the last three years and will again in 2026.
I understand the NFL might want to draw a younger viewing audience, but in the meantime, it is ignoring its existing audience. An S&P Global report from December 2024 said nearly half, or 47%, of viewers are aged 55 or older.
I hope the NFL will consider adding rock, country or pop back into the rotation. So, I’ve come up with some suggestions for the halftime show. What do you think?

Chris Stapleton — He is undoubtedly one of the biggest country stars around with a wealth of songs to choose from. He also has done a number of collaborations with other artists that could be featured, whether it be Adele, Ed Sheeran, Pink or Justin Timberlake.
Green Day — This punk rock band would bring a great retro vibe to the show. The group toured the last two years and could feature newer and classic songs. Heck, Dua Lipa just surprised her audience by bringing the band’s frontman up for a duet and it was a hit.
Taylor Swift, Adele or Pink — This is my girl-power pick. I’m including several options because I know many people have tired of Taylor Swift being everywhere. And her engagement to an NFL star is a complicating factor. But there is no denying she would bring eyeballs to a halftime show. Pink is a top-notch performer who I would love to see do the show, as well. And Adele’s powerful voice wouldn’t need any auto-tuning.
Jelly Roll – He has rap roots but has transitioned into country and soul, meaning he could bring both vibes to the show. His songs are full of real stories and struggles and he would be a great performer for the big stage.

My last suggestion is more open-ended, which is to say a repeat performance. Several artists performed years ago that I would love to see again. That includes Bruce Springsteen, U2 and Lady Gaga.
Political considerations aside, it’s simply time to welcome other genres of music back to the biggest sporting event of the year.

“What is an American?”
Before describing briefly some of the specifics of his speech, let’s acknowledge that the senator raises a significant question — whether you give him two thumbs up or just one finger is up to you.
After all, both gestures are worthy of First Amendment protection.
Schmitt’s speech made a few points worth noting.
America as a Homeland: Schmitt characterized America as the homeland for “Americans,” that it primarily belongs to “Europeans who settled America and conquered,” rather than coming here to embrace ideals of equality and freedom.
Exclusivity: Schmitt declared: “America belongs to us and only us.” While the phrase “white Christian nationalism” was absent from his speech, its underlying sentiment was palpable (It would have been a much more interesting occasion if he had delivered the speech at an NAACP convention).
Cultural Narrative: Schmitt’s rhetoric aligns with a broader narrative embraced by substantial parts of the conservative movement who feel their values are under threat from cultural elites and non-European immigration.
As a schoolboy, I remember how teachers celebrated the idea of America as a “melting pot.” This metaphor suggested that immigrants from various backgrounds could come together, adopt a new identity and contribute to a unified society. This narrative, however, often overlooked the darker aspects of American history, particularly the exclusion and elimination of indigenous peoples, the complexities surrounding immigration and, of course, the status of the formerly enslaved.
A great deal of what marks the American identity has been produced by immigrants. Many early English and European immigrants and their progeny played crucial roles in establishing American civilization. Yet, it’s essential to recognize that non-white individuals, including those brought here for involuntary labor and non-European immigrants seeking opportunities, have also significantly shaped the nation.
The question is not how to define Americans by excluding certain groups or people with certain beliefs, but whether we identify what Americans have in common.  If our Constitution protects our right to our own beliefs — which it does — what are the attributes or beliefs that unite us or at least unite most of us?
In short, what forms our identity?
I remember meditating on what it means to be an American a couple decades ago when I drove alone from San Francisco to St. Louis, a journey that renewed my impression of how big and beautiful this country is.
On a long solo trip, I like to have dinner at a regular café in a typical town along the way. My first dinner stop was a town in Nevada, where I entered a café with a typical American name in the center of a typical American town. To my surprise everyone there was speaking Spanish and seemed to be from Central America.
In Wyoming a couple days later, I repeated my quest. In another typical cafe with a typical American name, I found I was the only Anglo in the place.  Wow, I thought, this big country with big open spaces seems to be filling up with people who seem happy to be here, generating enough income to be dining in cafes.
Are they, too, Americans?  Was their arrival here like that of my maternal family forebears from Ireland in the 19th century who came to Minnesota as tenant farmers. Or my paternal Pennsylvania Dutch forebears, also farmers, who came from the Dresden area of Germany in the late 18th century?  My Irish Catholic mother (though to tell the whole truth her mother was German and more strictly Catholic) told stories of signs reading: “Help Wanted – Irish need not apply.”
Some have come to resent recent immigrants who, they believe, are taking their jobs. Perhaps so, but after a tornado struck St. Louis neighborhoods in May, I’ve noticed a lot of Spanish speaking men on our roofs.  Don’t tell ICE; I believe we need these non-native guys to get the roofs replaced.
Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt openly promoted white supremacism in a public speech

America, the land of opportunity, has always seemed a place with sizable disparities in wealth and opportunity. But since the 1980s, the gap between rich and the not-rich has become excessively large.
Polls in recent decades show that many Americans no longer believe that their hard work will mean a more prosperous future for their children than they have had. This belief is reflected in the grievances that have become increasingly influential in our political life.  Except somehow, those with grievances do not resent allegedly self-made politicians and nepo-babies who’ve figured out whom to blame for working people not getting rich or at least comfortable.
So, if we don’t blame the rich for what ails us, who else?  Immigrants, that’s who.
Much of our politics is about distraction. We can lose sight of the beliefs that unite us if we indulge too much in our grievances.
 Here is something I said in a speech nearly 20 years ago, as though anticipating Sen. Schmitt’s recent question as to what is an American.
“We have no common national origin or ethnicity that currently forms our shared identity as Americans. Instead, our identity has been forged by the rule of law and by our common experience that faithfulness to the law guarantees liberty, equality of opportunity and a functioning society even in the face of those who, through ambition for power or wealth, would seek to impose their will on the less powerful.”
With the common beliefs derived from the Declaration of Independence and enabled by the Constitution, we have accumulated our national experience without most of us having to be concerned day-to-day with a government that oppresses us. We also are comforted by the belief that we can make ourselves heard in our governance, certainly at the local level, even if it seems less so at the state or national level.
We get to vote, and sometimes our side loses. As Dick Tuck, California politico, candidate and trickster famously said when he lost a state senate race in 1966: “The people have spoken – the bastards.”
Our journey to elaborate on the identity of Americans continues.
To date, the long path has been toward inclusiveness, not exclusivity.
I don’t agree with a lot of what Sen. Schmitt said to the National Conservatism Conference last month, but I respect his right to say it. He and I are Americans, after all.
We Americans should continue the journey to find all that defines us, even when we disagree about it, guided I hope by a sense of decency in our discourse – a sense of decency that is not legally required but is nonetheless what I believe we owe to one another as well as to ourselves.
For starters, let’s find more ways to give one another the thumbs-up gesture and avoid the negativity of the middle-finger.

Gov. Phil Scott has appointed Zach Weight as a special prosecutor who will try cases against repeat offenders in Burlington as part of a new initiative to handle a rising backlog of criminal cases, Scott’s office announced on Thursday. 
Weight will handle the cases in the Chittenden County Community Accountability Court, which Scott unveiled last week. The court will focus on trying people who have five or more legal cases pending against them. 
Weight will temporarily leave his current position as deputy state’s attorney in Washington County to serve in the special prosecutor role, according to a press release from Scott’s office.

Scott announced the court last Friday, avowing that the initiative will surge resources toward addressing the backlog in cases in the county’s criminal courts. During a press conference Wednesday, Scott said the new court is the first part and “the major piece” in a 14-point plan to help Burlington. 
Public defenders saw a large recent uptick in criminal cases in Chittenden County, Vermont Defender General Matt Valerio said last week. The number of cases from July through September increased 37% over the level of cases during those same months a year prior. 
The day before Scott’s announcement, Valerio told lawmakers in an oversight committee that the increase in cases would put a major strain on the state’s court system. 
Weight is now set to try some of those cases. 
“I’m hopeful this short-term assignment will help address some of the issues facing Burlington and know Zach will serve Vermont well,” Scott said in the release. Weight graduated from Vermont Law School and has practiced as a criminal defense attorney in all 14 counties in the state, according to the release. 
“My focus is to champion public safety, uphold due process for defendants, and provide compassionate support for victims,” Weight said in the release. 
While pinpointing the cause of the recent increase in cases, Valerio said in an interview Friday the strain on the court system is in line with trends that started when the courts put everything on pause during the global Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. 
“The earthquake happens a thousand miles away in the middle of the ocean. And then eventually a wave builds up and it hits on the shore. I think we’re kind of getting a wave right now,” he said. 
Valerio said last week that there is no one factor that explains the recent increase in criminal cases. “This is definitely not a thing where there’s somebody to blame,” he said. 
Chittenden County State’s Attorney Sarah George, in a press release last week, said the county is seeing a group of 50 to 70 people who are “repeatedly causing harm” and are “not succeeding in existing diversion and deflection programs.” 
Scott announced the new court about a month after he said he had a plan to address concerns about public safety and drug use in Burlington. Scott’s plan came after Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak said she felt like Scott wasn’t doing enough to help the Queen City battle persistent social and economic challenges. 
Rachel Jolly, the assistant director of the Burlington Community Justice Center, said that most people who commit crimes repeatedly, and most people her organization interacts with, are lacking the resources to address their basic needs. In some cases, the center works with police after a crime is committed to offer an offender non-punitive methods to address the impact of their crimes. 
“The whole state is struggling with good solutions for these really taxing needs. You know, lack of housing, lack of long-term substance use treatment, mental health treatment, that’s adequate to meet the demand,” Jolly said. 
When those needs are unmet, it creates “unfavorable outcomes,” she said. Usually people who commit a crime or cause harm will repeat the behavior until they’re able to address their underlying motivation for those acts, Jolly said. 
Those motivations vary for different people, she said. Some of the services her organization provides can help people meet their needs and prevent future incidents, she said. 
Jolly isn’t sure how her organization will interact with the new court, but she’s happy the new court will add another tool to the toolbox, she said. She appreciates that officials are discussing “diverse responses to the scenario at hand,” she said. 
Scott, in his announcements about the court, has said the court will connect people to “the services they need.” But he did not specify what those services will be. 
Kathy Fox, a sociologist retired from the University of Vermont who has expertise in corrections, said that if the court’s named mission for accountability is simply to subject people to adjudications without addressing the underlying issues driving their behavior, then the court will not change crime. 
She said a comprehensive public health approach would be better.  If the mission is simply “to get people off the streets and into a custodial setting,” the court will be “a temporary fix at best,” Fox said.

(Dan Forer | Getty Images)The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (DPI) released its 2025-26 general school aid data this week, showing that 71% of public school districts will receive less general school aid this year, while over $350 million in general aid will be diverted to voucher schools.
Each year DPI is required by state law to release the certified aid figures by Oct. 15. The data for the 2025-26 school year shows that of 421 districts, 111 — or 26% — will receive more aid, while 301 districts — or 71% — will receive less. The numbers replace those from the estimate released in July, which had shown a projected 65% of schools would receive less aid. 
DPI noted in a release that the state’s total general aid remained flat this year at $5.58 billion. The Republican-led Legislature decided during the recent state budget process not to provide additional general aid to public school districts.
The distribution of general aid funds is determined by a formula that considers property valuation, student enrollment and shared costs. When school districts lose state aid, they do not lose school revenue authority, meaning many school districts will be left to decide whether to increase local property taxes to make up the difference or make more budget cuts. 
Democratic lawmakers, who have repeatedly called for increasing general school aid, blamed their Republican colleagues for the numbers during a virtual press conference Thursday morning.
Sen. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) said that data “provided a harsh reality check for school districts that their state Legislature, specifically the Republican-controlled state Legislature, which they have controlled for 30 out of the last 32 years, does not view them as a priority.” 
“When Democrats win a majority in the state Senate, our schools will not have to fear this Oct.15 date,” Smith said, adding that Democrats are “committed to investing in the future of Wisconsin children and re-establishing our state as one of the leaders in K-12 education as it once was.”
“This system that our state has been forced to adopt is not sustainable,” Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D- Whitefish Bay) said. In lieu of state funding, school districts in Wisconsin have turned to raising property taxes through referendum, which must be approved by voters, in order to meet their financial obligations, including paying staff salaries, purchasing educational materials and building costs.
After the state budget was signed, some school leaders warned that the trend of relying on property taxes would continue without a state general aid increase. 
“Due to the Legislature’s failure to fund our schools, Wisconsin already has one of the highest property tax rates in the country, and if our communities continue to be forced to referendum, those tax rates will continue to rise, making our state even more expensive than it already is. Wisconsin residents are depending on their elected officials to rein in the skyrocketing costs of living in our state,” Habush-Sinykin said. “Yet, the Republican-controlled Legislature has no problem forcing their constituents to suffer under continuously rising property taxes.”
Viroqua School Board President Angie Lawrence said during the press conference that the system is bolstering inequity in Wisconsin schools. 
“The school districts and areas of high poverty are generally failing when trying to pass a referendum and the wealthy districts generally are passing their referendum when going to their communities… Is this who we really want to be?” Lawrence asked. “Don’t you think that our tax dollars should be supporting every student equally so that each student has a path to academic excellence, and we shouldn’t have to go to referendum in order to provide a high quality education for our students?”
School voucher programs grow
Alongside funding for public schools, the DPI also released data on the costs of the state’s school voucher programs, which use taxpayer dollars to cover the cost of tuition for students who attend private and charter schools.
The estimated annual cost for the state’s voucher programs in the 2025-26 school year overall is about $700.7 million.
According to the DPI data, $357.5 million will be reduced from general school aid to go towards private voucher schools in 2025-26. This includes $260.9 million for the Wisconsin Parental Choice Program, $44.4 million for the Racine Parental Choice Program and $52.2 million for the Special Needs Scholarship Program. 
The rest of the $700.7 million going toward voucher schools will come from the state’s general purpose revenue to fund students in the Milwaukee voucher program as well as for students in the Racine voucher program who enrolled before the 2015-16 school year. The Milwaukee program is estimated to cost $336 million.
Enrollment in all four of the state’s school choice programs rose by 2,349 students in the 2025-26 school year, reaching a high of 60,972 students. 
The Milwaukee program grew by 235 students, the Racine program shrank by 14 students, the statewide program grew by 1,814 students and the special needs program grew by 419 students. 
Organizations that support school voucher programs had mixed reactions — celebrating the growth, but also cautioning that it was modest compared to previous years.
“Lawmakers in Madison should continue to prioritize protecting these private-school options for all students,” said Carol Shires, vice president of operations for School Choice Wisconsin. “This milestone validates the strong support from Wisconsin’s political leaders for strengthening the financial foundation of parental choice programs.”
School Choice Wisconsin, the largest school choice lobbying group in the state, also noted in its press release that the growth comes as an enrollment cap on the statewide Wisconsin Parental Choice Program is set to expire in the 2026-27 school year. 
“[The caps coming off] will allow more families – including those now on waiting lists – to benefit from the nation’s longest-standing program committed to educational freedom,” School Choice Wisconsin said.
Caps on school voucher program participation, which limits the percentage of students in a district who can participate, have been increasing by 1% per year since 2017 and reached 10% of a school district’s enrollment in the 2025-26 school year. When the nation’s first school voucher program launched in Milwaukee in 1990, enrollment was limited to no more than 1% of the Milwaukee Public Schools student population. When the statewide program launched in 2013, enrollment was limited to just 500 students and no more than 1% of a district’s enrollment. 
According to the Institute for Reforming Government, a conservative think tank, this year’s numbers represent stable growth for the Milwaukee, special needs and independent charter school programs, but the Wisconsin Parental Choice Program had its lowest growth since 2017-2018.
Quinton Klabon, the organization’s senior research director, urged supporters of school choice to not be complacent. 
“Informing parents, expanding high-quality schools, and protecting schools from hostile red tape are high priorities. Otherwise, the baby bust will close choice schools,” Klabon said in a statement.
The total number of schools participating in the statewide program has risen from 403 schools in 2024-25 to 415 schools in 2025-26.
Republicans have introduced some legislation this year to support enrollment in voucher programs. AB 460 from Rep. Cindi Duchow (R-Delafield) would change state law to ensure that siblings of a student who participated in a voucher program would be eligible for enrollment. AB 415, coauthored by Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) would prohibit DPI from requiring documents to verify a student’s residence unless their residence has changed from a previous verification. 
Democratic lawmakers and public education stakeholders expressed concerns about what the school voucher enrollment numbers will mean for the state’s public schools.
Lawrence of Viroqua called attention to the amount of money going to the Academy of Excellence, a Milwaukee virtual private school that has been criticized for misusing public funds and for blurring the line between homeschooling and voucher schools. Students who are homeschooled in Wisconsin aren’t supposed to receive public funding under state law.
“The Academy of Excellence is not excellent,” Lawrence said. “It is not meeting the requirements of high standards of public education, and yet it received over $40 million in tax dollars from the state of Wisconsin [in the 2024-25 school year]… They are funding families that choose to homeschool without the cost of bricks and mortar, or the transparency of how they’re spending the tax dollars they receive. If our state wants to make improvements in education for our students, let’s put our money where our mouth is and spend our tax dollars to improve public education so we can provide the highest academic outcomes for each child.” 
The Academy of Excellence is estimated to receive over $50 million in 2025-26 from the state with over 4,000 students enrolled. Those enrollment numbers include students in various voucher programs throughout the state — 808 students from the Milwaukee program, 200 from the Racine program, 3,340 from the statewide program and 63 who are enrolled in the special needs program.
Democratic lawmakers in recent months have introduced an array of bills aimed at limiting voucher school programs and increasing transparency surrounding the costs. 
This week Sen. Chris Larson (D-Milwaukee) is circulating draft legislation that would bar virtual schools from being able to participate in the voucher program. 
Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire) has introduced AB 307, which would eliminate the sunset on the voucher program caps, leaving them at 10% into the future, and AB 496, which would require an annual verification of the income of voucher students’ families. (Currently, there is an income cap to enroll in the programs of 220% for the Wisconsin Parental Choice Program and 300% for the Milwaukee and Racine programs. If a student is continuing in a program or was on a waiting list, they are not required to meet income limits.) Lawmakers have also proposed legislation to disclose voucher costs on property tax bills across the state.
Habush-Sinykin said on the call that the voucher program caps coming off is a “crisis” facing the state’s education system. However, she said advancing bills that would change the state’s trajectory will likely take new leadership in the Senate and Assembly. 
“It’s really up to all of us to explain how important it is to have a change in the legislative leadership so that we can have bills… like keeping caps on vouchers, etc., be heard and voted on,” Habush Sinykin said.

People in both states who are covered by the federal health insurance program that primarily serves older adults have more trouble accessing and affording care than those in other states, and the quality of care they receive is lower, according to a report released Thursday by the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that studies health care access in the U.S.
Medicare costs in Louisiana and Mississippi are some of the highest in the nation, but do not correspond to better health outcomes for patients. The states’ life expectancies at 65 are some of the lowest in the country, according to federal data. Mississippi comes in last place, with people living two years shorter than the national average.
Lower ranking states have weaker overall health infrastructure, a trend across Southeastern states, said Gretchen Jacobson, the Commonwealth Fund’s vice president for Medicare.

The report used 31 metrics to assess each state’s care, including strictness of prior authorization policies, access to outpatient care and how much beneficiaries pay.
About 650,000 Mississippians and 960,000 Louisianans – over 20% of each state’s population – are enrolled in Medicare, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The program provides coverage to nearly all people 65 years or older and covers some younger people with disabilities.
Sixty-nine million Americans are enrolled in Medicare, making it the largest payer for health care in the country. The program was established in 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson to provide health insurance to older Americans. It has changed over the last six decades, expanding eligibility to more people and offering additional benefits, like prescription drug coverage and Medicare Advantage plans.
Private companies run Medicare Advantage plans and provide an alternative to traditional Medicare. About half of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in such plans.

Medicare was designed to deliver uniform benefits to older Americans regardless of where they live, but states differ widely in their delivery of quality care, the report authors said.
“We have more work to do to ensure it delivers the care equally and effectively for people in every state,” said Dr. Joseph Betancourt, president of the Commonwealth Fund, during a press conference Wednesday
Some disparities stem from how the program is structured, because Medicare relies on private providers to deliver care, said Mark Diana, associate dean for research and graduate programs at the University of West Florida who has researched health policy and management.
“All of the variations in how private medical care is provided across the country exist in the Medicare program, just like everywhere else,” Diana said.
While coverage may be the same across states, the services that patients are able to access may differ.
In Louisiana and Mississippi, older Medicare recipients are prescribed medications that should be avoided in the elderly at higher rates than in other states, according to the report. Such medications increase the risk of confusion, falls, bleeding risk and other potential harms.
Nursing home residents who are hospitalized are readmitted to the hospital more frequently in Louisiana and Mississippi, and avoidable emergency room visits are more common,the report said.
Patients are sicker when they enroll in Medicare in Louisiana and Mississippi, where there are high rates of uninsurance and poverty, said David Radley, a senior scientist for the Commonwealth Foundation, during a press conference Wednesday. For example, more than two out of three Medicare beneficiaries in Mississippi and Louisiana have three or more chronic conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure.
“When people are sick coming into Medicare, they tend to be really sick when they’re in Medicare,” Radley said.
Research has shown that people who are uninsured before age 65 have higher health care costs when they enroll in Medicare.
Improving health care systems’ ability to care for people of all ages will enhance care for Medicare recipients, Jacobson said.
Even with the support of Medicare, older people in Mississippi and Louisiana struggle to afford the costs of health care. More Medicare recipients in Mississippi and Louisiana went without care because they couldn’t afford it in the past year than in most other states.
Experts say the Medicaid spending cuts passed this summer in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act may impact low-income Medicare beneficiaries, many of whom are enrolled in both programs.
Cuts to Medicaid may make it more difficult for dually enrolled beneficiaries to access services that aren’t required to be provided by traditional Medicare plans, like dental care or home and community-based services, Jacobson said.
More than a third of Mississippians and Louisianans over 65 went without a dental visit in the past year, the report said.
The legislation also imposed a moratorium on changes that aimed to reduce enrollment barriers for Medicare Savings Programs, which allow Medicaid to pay Medicare premiums and other costs for low-income beneficiaries. These changes will not be implemented until 2034.
The open enrollment period for Medicare Advantage and Part D prescription drug plans runs Oct. 15 to Dec. 7.

(Photo by Larry Mayer/Getty Images)The Indiana Farm Bureau wants lawmakers to offer more property tax relief, improve services for rural residents and preserve productive farmland.
“We need the General Assembly to consider legislation that will protect farms and rural communities to ultimately ensure safe, affordable food,” President Randy Kron said in a news release. That’s “not just for Hoosiers, but for people all over the world.”
The influential group plans to keep up the pressure on property taxes, despite action this spring.

Gov. Mike Braun signed a sprawling property and income tax plan into law in April. Local governments warned the cuts went too deep, while Hoosier taxpayers complained the relief was meager.
Senate Enrolled Act 1 “didn’t make a big enough dent in farmers’ pocketbooks to strengthen the (agricultural) economy,” Kron said. “With continued pressure from rising input costs, land prices and property taxes, it will be difficult for farmers just to break even this year. We need lasting property tax reform now.”
The organization also called for greater support to the rural communities that host Indiana’s farms.
That includes investments in food production infrastructure, economic development projects, education, health care and emergency services, according to the news release.
“Emergency medical services, fire and police are essential to keep rural communities surviving long term,” said Katie Nelson, the Farm Bureau’s executive director of public policy. “We will support legislation this coming year that prioritizes effective, efficient and responsive local government services for our members.”
Rounding out the list of priorities was conserving fertile ground.
Indiana lost almost 350,000 acres of farmland between 2010 and 2022 — mostly to residential development — according to a 2024 study conducted by the Indiana State Department of Agriculture.
Indiana lost nearly 350k acres of farmland in 12 years, state estimates

“Food security is national security,” Nelson said. “As the average person gets farther and farther away from the farm, it becomes increasingly important that farmers have a voice in the policies that impact them. Our members have made it clear that legislation protecting prime agricultural soils and natural resources should remain a priority moving forward.”
This objective includes more beneficial zoning and land use policies, plus a look at energy and water.
The Indiana Farm Bureau builds its policy priorities starting with its county-level organizations, each of which can make policy recommendations. A Farm Bureau committee and, later, hundreds of delegates from across the state, consider the suggestions. Then, the board of directors settles on areas of focus.
Organization leaders and staff plan to push the priorities with lawmakers at an annual breakfast on Organization Day — the ceremonial first day of the legislative session — as well as in January, when the session begins in earnest.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)A stalemate between Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin and employees who have been seeking union representation for the last 10 months shows little sign of breaking soon.
At a mass meeting Monday at the Alliant Center in Madison, members of Group Health, sometimes called GHC for short, passed a motion directing the co-op to voluntarily recognize the union as the employees originally petitioned in December — covering three departments and a series of health care professionals.
The motion set a deadline of Friday, Oct. 17. Marty Anderson, Group Health’s chief strategy and business development officer, said Thursday that action on all the motions would likely be deferred, probably until November.
“We communicated clearly ahead of the meeting that all motions are advisory in nature,” Anderson said. “Any deadlines that would be in any of the motions would also be advisory in nature.”
Monday’s mass meeting was the first of its kind for Group Health members to ask questions of the co-op administration and express their opinions about the union drive. About 172 people attended, according to a Group Health spokesperson. Group Health has more than 50,000 Class A and Founding members — the two groups that were considered eligible to attend, according to the co-op.
In the spring, a volunteer committee met with the board to argue in favor of recognizing the union. 
People attending the Monday meeting described the crowd as strongly supportive of the union, and the voice votes in favor of recognizing the union and other motions favored by union supporters were unanimous, according to Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Wisconsin. 
Growing dissatisfaction 
At a rally outside the Alliant Center before the meeting, South Central Labor Federation President Kevin Gundlach, a Group Health member, charged that the co-op “has lost its way” in its response to the union organizing drive.
“We want GHC to listen to the workers,” Gundlach said. “And these workers know, and it says on my shirt here” — he pointed to his chest — “it’s better in a union.”
Group Health has rejected charges that it’s trying to thwart the union drive, contending that it simply wants health care employees in all departments to take part in the union representation vote — not just those from departments and job classifications that were included in the original union petition.
Union supporters say that claim is disingenuous and a ploy to “dilute the vote,” in the words of several workers interviewed — racking up votes against the union from employees in departments that don’t have the same concerns.
Anderson denied the charge. “We don’t know” what the votes will be, he said.
According to workers involved in the union drive, the Group Health union campaign grew out of increasing dissatisfaction in specific co-op departments with working conditions and what they contend was a lack of input into the co-op’s practices.
“I feel like we can improve the patient care that we provide through unionization and through increased involvement in decision-making,” Dr. Nisha Rajagopalan, a family physician who has worked at Group Health for 22 years, said Thursday.
Pay practices, employee turnover and a voice at the table are all reasons employees have cited for supporting the union.
“GHC leadership stopped collaborating with us and despite our many patient care concerns and our many meeting requests,” said Julie Vander Werff, a physician assistant, the lead speaker at the Monday rally.
Who should be in the union?
Complicating the organizing campaign is the conflict over exactly who among Group Health’s workers should be included in the union.
Union supporters involved in the organizing drive originally proposed that the union represent a bargaining unit of about 220 people. They were doctors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners and nursing staff in three departments: primary care, urgent care and dermatology. Their petition also included physical therapists, occupational therapists and health educators.
The petition was filed Dec. 12, 2024. Group Health filed a brief asserting that the unit the employees sought “was an inappropriate unit,” said Anderson, the Group Health executive.
To resolve the differences, a National Labor Relations Board staffer held a meeting on Dec. 30 in Madison, where he moved between separate rooms, one housing Group Health executives and the co-op’s lawyer, the other housing SEIU Wisconsin staff and Group Health employees leading the union drive.
The NLRB staffer suggested to the union group that they narrow their petition to a single clinic, Group Health employees wrote in a letter to the Group Health board of directors Feb. 10, 2025. Hoping to get an agreement, they took the suggestion.
Group Health opposed the single-clinic unit, however. In subsequent hearings the co-op management’s lawyer argued the vote should include all direct care employees, including in departments that weren’t part of the union’s original petition.
After reviewing briefs from both sides, the NLRB regional director in Minneapolis who heard the case ruled that the single clinic unit that the union had proposed would not be an appropriate bargaining unit. The decision issued by Regional Director Jennifer Hadsall stated that the unit proposed by the employer, Group Health, was appropriate and set an election among all the co-op’s health care employees.
SEIU Wisconsin, however, moved to block the election. A raft of pending unfair labor practice charges against the employer could scare employees from voting for the union, SEIU charged. Hadsall agreed to block the vote until the charges are resolved.  
As a result, the vote is on hold. The NLRB investigation of the charges is on hold as well, because of the federal government shutdown.
Shared concerns, conflicting concerns
In her order, Hadsall also included a footnote that states she did not address the unit that the employees had originally asked for because it had not been formally litigated.
“We had always argued that we are a clinically integrated organization,” Anderson said. “Our staff floats between various parts of the organization and different clinics. And the bargaining unit was established [consisting of] all of our clinical sites and all of our direct care employees.”
But pro-union employees say there are concrete differences between employees who are in the groups that they had originally included in the union petition and the rest of the Group Health staff — including direct care providers.
“Initially our bargaining unit included employees who were in primary care and urgent care,” said Rajagopalan, the family doctor. “We practice similarly and we share the same concerns. There are other departments within GHC that don’t share the same concerns [and] practice very differently than we do. That’s why our initial bargaining unit is an appropriate unit.”
Pat Raes, president of SEIU Wisconsin and a nurse at UnityPoint-Meriter hospital in Madison, said that throughout her health care career she’s seen many workplaces where only some groups of workers are unionized.
“At the bedside or at the side of the patient, it doesn’t make a difference because the priority is patient care,” Raes said. “It’s not whether you’re unionized or not.”
Addressing the rally before Monday night’s meeting, Steve Rankin said it was “entirely normal” for workers in a single workplace to be represented by different unions or no union depending on their department or position.
“There is no reason that everyone at Group Health has to be in the same union,” said Rankin, who joined Group Health when it was founded in 1976 and has been active in marshalling Group Health patients to support the union effort. “We call on GHC to recognize the bargaining unit chosen by the workers themselves and to commit to bargaining in good faith toward the contract.”
While the board has yet to consider the motion that was passed at Monday night’s meeting, Anderson said Thursday that voluntary recognition was unlikely. 
“We want an NLRB sanctioned and overseen vote,” he said. “That’s always going to be our criteria.”

Casper teen’s lawyers say a judge gave him a 42- to 75-year sentence that’s out of line with constitutional provisions through a quirk in Wyoming law. 
The post Attorneys ask Wyoming Supreme Court: Was teen’s lengthy homicide sentence too harsh? appeared first on WyoFile .","An appeal before the Wyoming State Supreme Court asks a question at the heart of juvenile justice: whether a sentence of 42 to 75 years for a Casper teen who pleaded guilty to second-degree murder is cruel and unusual punishment.
The case touches on long-running issues of fair sentencing practices for youth, both in Wyoming and around the country. Since the Legislature acted on the subject in 2013, Wyoming has been among what today are 25 states that outlaw sentences of life without a chance at parole for children. 
But in the case of Casper teenager Eavan Castaner, his attorneys maintain a Natrona County District Court judge handed him an unusually cruel sentence for a juvenile offender. The judge did so under a quirk in Wyoming statute that allows juveniles to receive a worse sentence for second-degree murder than for the more severe first-degree murder, they argued.
Castaner’s sentence goes against national recognition that the courts should handle juvenile offenders more gently than adults, they said. 
“Despite the horrific nature of his crime, he was only 15 years old. He was a child,” Casper attorney Ian Sanderfer wrote in an amicus brief in the case, filed on behalf of the Juvenile Law Center, a national organization. “Because of his developmental immaturity, Mr. Castaner cannot be considered as culpable as an adult offender and cannot be treated as one under the Constitution.”
Attorneys for the state say Castaner and his attorney knew the statutory guidelines when the boy pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and made a bid for a lower sentence. His appeal comes because he didn’t like the results when a judge decided otherwise, Kristen Jones of the Wyoming Attorney General’s office argued Thursday.

Jones listed a series of difficult decisions a defendant must make as a criminal case proceeds. “Do I testify, do I not? Do I file the motion, do I not? Do I take the plea, do I not?” she said. Castaner had “roll[ed] the dice,” and pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, which has a minimum sentence of 20 years and a maximum of life behind bars.
The Wyoming Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the case Thursday morning at the University of Wyoming Law School. The court occasionally hears cases there to give law students an opportunity to experience the process.
Castaner admitted earlier this year to shooting and killing his ex-girlfriend, Lene’a Brown, in May 2024. He was 15 at the time, and she was 17.
The killing was among several instances of youth violence that have rattled Casper in recent years. Castaner’s sentencing was followed this year by another teen offender pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit second-degree murder in the high-profile stabbing death of 14-year-old Bobby Maher. That teen has yet to be sentenced, but Natrona County District Attorney Dan Itzen has reportedly indicated he will seek a sentence with a minimum of 30 years — above the 25 years that Castaner’s attorneys say should be the minimum for juvenile homicides of any degree.
Horrifying crime
Castaner sent a series of texts leading up to the shooting, saying he wanted to kill someone to “release my anger,” according to court records. He had also texted his ex-girlfriend, Brown, that he wished her dead. 
When Castaner met with a group, including his ex-girlfriend, in a park, he shot and killed her and fled the scene. Witnesses directed police to the home Castaner had run to, and he surrendered when they arrived. Castaner later confessed.
At the sentencing, the father of the slain girl, David Henrickson, told District Court Judge Dan Forgey in a statement that since his daughter’s death, “I scream inside all day long,” according to an article on the hearing published by Oil City News. Henrickson buried his daughter, who was Northern Arapaho, on the Wind River Indian Reservation last year, he told WyoFile in an April phone interview. The death and court proceedings drew attention from activists concerned about the epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women.  
Brown was passionate about her relationships with friends and family and loved riding dirt bikes, Henrickson told WyoFile. At the time of her death, she had just started working at a Dairy Queen and was saving money to buy a car, he said.
At Castaner’s hearing, Itzen told the judge his aim in asking for a long sentence was to make the next potential killer take pause. 
“Judge, make no mistake, this is not about rehabilitation, this is about punishment,” he said, according to appeal briefs filed with the state supreme court. “This is about deterrence.”
Conventional wisdom about juvenile justice holds that such offenders should be treated differently in part because they’re not yet capable of evaluating the consequences of their actions in the same way an adult does, Castaner’s attorneys say. In many cases, mental illness, addiction and other developmental disabilities can drive the crime, and Castaner’s attorney Ryan Semerad argued at the sentencing that those factors played a role in this case.
Those arguments echoed various opinions from the U.S. Supreme Court over the years. In 2010, the court ruled that children could not receive life without parole for non-homicide offenses. In 2012, the court issued a ruling requiring judges to consider “the mitigating aspects of youth,” before sentencing a child to life without parole in a homicide case, according to the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth. 
Quirk in statute
A year after those cases, the Wyoming Legislature outlawed life sentences without parole for juvenile offenders of any crime. They also specifically changed statute to ensure a juvenile convicted of first-degree murder becomes eligible for parole after 25 years. But the Legislature did not amend the statute for second-degree murder at that time, and left the sentencing range there at 20 years to life. 
Forgey’s sentence, Semerad argued Thursday, is unconstitutionally disproportionate to the crime he committed. If Castaner had pled guilty to the more serious crime of first-degree murder, under Wyoming statute for juveniles he would have received a sentence with a chance for parole at 25 years.

Though lawmakers did not specifically rewrite the language for second-degree murder, it stood to reason they intended the parole minimum for a worse crime to also apply to the lesser charge, he argued.  
Under his current sentence, Castaner could be 59 years old before he gets his first chance at release. The state, however, has argued that if Castaner behaves well in prison and accumulates what’s called “good time” credits awarded by the Wyoming Department of Corrections, he’ll be eligible for parole in 28 years. But if Semerad wins the appeal, Castaner would receive a new sentencing hearing, where he can’t be sentenced to more than 25 years without an opportunity for parole.
With good time, Castaner could earn a parole hearing earlier, making the difference in his prison sentence potentially significant if he wins the appeal. 
Jones, from the Wyoming Attorney General’s office, argued that Semerad is asking the court to issue a sweeping new minimum for juvenile offenders in any crimes, instead of allowing the Legislature to set statute. “That’s a very large piece of legislation for this court to sign,” she said.
The state supreme court now has 90 days, or longer, to issue a ruling in the case.

The tax credit – proposed by state Rep. Angela Witwer’s (D-Delta Township) House Bill 4825 – could be claimed by beverage container distributors selling to dealers in Michigan. 
Approved under a ballot initiative in 1976, Michigan’s bottle bill places a 10-cent deposit on containers for soft drinks, soda water, carbonated natural or mineral water or other non-alcoholic carbonated drinks; beer, ale or other malt drinks as well as mixed-wine and mixed-spirit drinks. When the container is returned to a retailer, the deposit is returned to the consumer.
After the container is returned, it falls to the distributor to pick up, transport, clean, process and recycle returnable containers, Witwer explained to the committee. 
These distributors spend $60 million a year to operate the bottle bill on behalf of the state, Witwer said, and while stores receive some reimbursement for their participation, distributors do not.
Witwer said her bill aims to offset some of that cost.
Brett Visner, vice president of the Michigan Beer and Wine and Wholesalers explained that when the bottle bill was first adopted, any unclaimed deposits were directed to the distributors in order to fund their infrastructure. 
However, the current law distributes the first $1 million in unclaimed deposits collected each year toward the Michigan State Police to support enforcement of the bottle bill until that fund reaches a maximum of $3 million. Then 75% of the following collections goes toward environmental cleanup, redevelopment and education on pollution prevention. The last 25% is returned to retailers.
“It’s an expensive, dirty business,” Visner said, explaining that the process of cleaning containers, shredding plastic, and crushing glass requires a tremendous amount of equipment and warehouse space.

While distributors have been without a regular avenue for reimbursement for years, Witwer’s plan offers consistent reimbursement that will help distributors plan for infrastructure costs alongside offsetting their cost of operations, Visner said.
The half-cent per container credit equates to roughly $20 million a year for all distributors, Visner said, though he noted that credit was based on the $60 million cost for operating the bottle bill, which has risen since the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In response to a question from Rep. Angela Rigas (R-Caledonia), Visner explained that the half-cent credit was based on a previous 28.5% tax credit enacted in 2008 before it was eliminated in 2011. 

This would provide Michigan beer and wine wholesalers with roughly $8 million, Visner explained, and while members would prefer full reimbursement, the association has been working to secure some form of reimbursement for several years. 
The committee did not take votes on the bill at Thursday’s meeting. 
The bill is tie-barred to Rep. Joseph Aragona’s (R-Clinton Township) House Bill 4823, which makes various changes to the Michigan Liquor Control Code.

(Danielle P. Richards for New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s teacher workforce remained roughly level in the 2023-2024 school year, but retirements remained elevated above prepandemic levels, as did the number of new educators entering the workforce, according to a Rutgers University report released Thursday.
Though the number of teachers in New Jersey remained stable, shifting trends in the number of students seeking to become educators risk creating future problems, said Stephanie Walsh, assistant director of Rutgers University’s Heldrich Center, which authored the report.
“New Jersey’s overall teacher workforce looks steady on the surface, but rising exits and shortages in key subjects signal potential challenges when we look at the more granular level,” Walsh said.
Increasing departures and a thinning pipeline have been key concerns for New Jersey lawmakers seeking to address the state’s long-standing teacher shortage.
Lawmakers have passed legislation easing testing requirements for teaching certificates and allowing retired educators to temporarily return to the workforce without disrupting their pensions.
New Jersey had 117,483 teachers in the 2023-2024 school year, the report says, up slightly from the 117,043 recorded in the prior school year. But the state saw sizable decreases in some subject areas, including ones that have faced perennial shortages over the 10 years examined by the study.
World language and math teachers saw the greatest declines over the decade.
The number of world language teachers declined to 3,747 in the 2023-2024 school year, down from 4,166 a decade earlier, a roughly 10% drop. The number of math teachers fell by 9% over the same period, dropping from 6,313 to 5,753.
The report raises concerns about New Jersey’s stable of computer science teachers, noting that statewide, there were more than 480 students for every computer science teacher. The report projects that ratio would fall to about 452-to-1 in the coming school years.
“The data show that without action, critical areas like multilingual learning and computer science may face widening gaps,” Walsh said.
The number of new teachers remained well below prepandemic levels, when the state was already seeing fewer and fewer would-be educators seek certification.
In the 2023-2024 school year, the state issued 9,598 new provisional teaching certificates, down from 20,584 in the 2016-2017 school year.
Retirements and other permanent exits from the profession fell to 1,029, down from 1,210 the prior school year. In 2016-2017, the earliest year for which teacher exit data was available, 701 educators permanently left the workforce.
That meant the state was getting just nine new teachers for every one leaving the profession, down from 29 in the 2016-2017 school year.
“While this rate remains well above a one-to-one replacement rate, there is a concerning downward trend,” the report says.

In Fort Washakie, kids celebrate Farm to School Day with beef and corn from local farmers and lettuce from their school garden.
The post Farm to school cafeteria: Wyoming students experience locally grown food appeared first on WyoFile .","FORT WASHAKIE—When Riverton farmer Lindsey Anderson dropped 1,000 ears of corn off at Fort Washakie School in early September, Food Service Director Krystal Northcott had a daunting task in front of her. 
She started shucking them that day, but it was clear she needed help if she was going to get through the morass in a timely manner. Help arrived in the form of dozens of students, who, along with teacher Tahnee Robinson, made short work of it, sending the shucked corn to the freezer.
“We were done like that,” Northcott said, snapping her fingers.

The helpers and their fellow students were able to taste the fruits of their labors on Monday when Fort Washakie School held a Farm to School Day lunch. 
On the menu: corn on the cob from 1890 Farm, sloppy joes featuring beef from Griffin/Rees Ranch near Arapahoe and lettuce grown on school grounds by Kerry Noonan’s second-grade class. 
So how did it taste? Kids being kids, not everyone was adventurous enough to try all the local ingredients. But the ones who did taste the food generally gave positive reviews.

“It tastes the same … but better,” said Watela Bennett, a second-grade student, after biting into her sloppy joe. 
Wyoming’s Farm to School program has a simple aim: get more local food into the state’s cafeterias. The goal is to connect students with healthy ingredients while also teaching them about agriculture and nutrition.  
There are challenges. Wyoming’s harsh climate and northern latitude make a wide range of produce hard to grow — particularly during the months school is in session. Because school districts prepare thousands of meals daily, they need to order items well in advance and in enormous quantities, which can make orders difficult to fill for small farms.

Under the leadership of Program Coordinator Bobby Lane, the statewide program has seen substantial growth. The number of school meals served with Wyoming products exploded to 40,000 in 2024, up from under 2,000 in 2023, according to the Wyoming Department of Education.
Farm to School Day, which is just one part of the larger program, marks a day to highlight local food with a celebratory lunch menu. This fall, districts have participated by offering local beef, potatoes, corn, grain flour and lettuce. Some 35 districts have now signed on to participate in Farm to School, said Lane, who was in Fort Washakie to support the staff and talk to students.

Lane helped orchestrate Fort Washakie’s event, but he was among many to make it happen. The Andersons donated the corn, John and Darla Griffin donated a cow, 307 Meat Company in Laramie processed the 800-plus pounds of beef and the Wyoming Hunger Initiative paid for the processing. 
Farm to School Wyoming is gaining momentum, Lane said. The program will hold its inaugural conference on Oct. 28-29 in Casper.
“It’s like a snowball running down the mountain,” he said. “It’s just getting bigger and bigger.”

More grizzly bears are dying in the Yellowstone area. That should be a wake-up call, writes Molly Absolon.
The post Can we learn to co-exist with grizzlies? appeared first on WyoFile .","This commentary was originally published by Writers on the Range.
This summer, a grizzly cub in Grand Teton National Park gained international fame after an adult male bear killed the yearling’s two siblings. The sole survivor of the attack, dubbed “Miracle,” then separated from its mother to fend for itself, sometimes hanging around a busy area of the park.

Opinion

As Miracle’s story spread, the cub became the object of fascination for thousands of people. Perhaps that’s no surprise, as many of us are intrigued by the grizzly’s power and strength, along with the reality that it’s an apex predator, like us. 
Miracle’s survival is precarious. Since she left the protection of her mother so early, she’s on her own, finding food before hibernating. Seventy-seven grizzlies died in the Yellowstone area last year — the highest number yet. As of September 2025, 63 bears had been killed; at this rate, the number of dead bears will surpass last year’s record. What’s going on?
You could say that grizzly bear recovery in the Lower 48 is a success story. Prior to European settlement, an estimated 50,000 bears roamed throughout the Lower 48. By 1970, though, only about 800 remained, with perhaps 130 of them in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. 
In 1975, grizzlies were listed under the Endangered Species Act, which ended their indiscriminate slaughter, and bear numbers slowly rebounded. Today, the Forest Service says an estimated 700 grizzlies live in and around the Yellowstone area, with maybe 1,000 more in the Northern Continental Divide region of Montana. Despite the increase in numbers, mortality rates are on the rise. 
Most wildlife managers say the current rate is not a matter of concern. They say the species is stable. 
And yet, is it? Roughly 200 cubs are born in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem recovery area each year, but of those, only around 40 survive. Wildlife managers assure us bears are doing well, but is this sustainable — especially when the mortality rate keeps inching upward year after year?
The most obvious reason for bear deaths is us. We are everywhere. 2024 marked the second-busiest year in Yellowstone National Park’s history with more than 4.7 million visitors. In August of 2025, the park was on track to see a 2% visitor increase over 2024. 
On top of increased visitation, the human population in the Rocky Mountain West, where grizzlies roam, is growing steadily. Teton County, Wyoming has seen a 10% increase in residents over the last decade. The population in Teton County, Idaho is up 74% since 1990. Gallatin County, Montana has grown about 40% in the last 10 years. 
On the ground, you can’t miss the impacts of growth: Trails are crowded. Parking is at a premium. You need reservations at restaurants and the traffic is often stop-and-go. Not surprisingly, bear-human conflicts are more frequent: Vehicle collisions kill bears, interactions with landowners kill bears.
Grizzlies might do fine with more people if their habitat were intact and healthy, but much of their home ground has been in moderate to severe drought for several years, according to U.S. Drought Monitor. This year’s berry crop was dismal. Whitebark pines, whose seeds are an important food source for bears, are threatened by beetles and blister rust. 
All this forces grizzlies to search out new food sources and some of the best ones turn out to be ours. Our cows and sheep. Our apple trees. Our bee hives. 
Wyoming U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman has introduced legislation to take away endangered species protections for grizzly bears, which would be a major blow to their survival. “People shouldn’t have to live in fear of grizzly bears rummaging through their trash or endangering their children,” Hageman said. Such comments are deliberately inflammatory. 
I have heard three people describe surviving a bear attack decades ago. All three insisted that the bear was only acting in self-defense. One even remembers how awed he was by the diamond-like glint of water droplets on the bear’s fur as she ran toward him. 
I’m not sure what would happen if I faced a charging bear. I just want enough wherewithal to pull out my bear spray. While I hope I never have to deploy that spray, I am willing to take the risk to know wild bears roam the landscape. If grizzlies were gone, something vital would be missing from our world. 
While grizzly bear mortality may not yet be alarming wildlife managers, I hope we’ve gotten a wake-up call.

Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., and registered nonpartisan Dan Osborn. (Juan Salinas II and Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN —  Former nonpartisan Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn is closing the fundraising gap against Nebraska Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts in Osborn’s second bid for a Senate seat.
Osborn raised $1.09 million in his latest campaign funding haul, while Ricketts raised $884,011 for his campaign and brought in an additional $486,128 through a separate joint fundraising committee — the Pete Ricketts Victory Fund, according to federal fundraising reports. That brings the former two-term governor’s combined war chest to $1.37 million in the third quarter, which runs from July through September.
Ricketts still has more cash on hand than Osborn, with $1.19 million compared to Osborn’s $502,000. But Osborn’s latest fundraising numbers indicate he is again raising enough to mount a serious challenge to a sitting senator. He outraised Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer in the 2024 race, in which he raised $14 million and lost by about six percentage points.

The Ricketts campaign criticized Osborn’s latest fundraising numbers, saying he received a donation from a campaign committee associated with Massachusetts Democra›tic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and from a political action committee affiliated with former ​​Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester as examples of Osborn’s Democratic Party “connections.” 
Warren for Senate, Inc. gave Osborn $2,000, the max a campaign committee can give to another candidate per primary race and per general election. Tester’s Treasure State PAC gave him $5,000. 
The Osborn campaign says more than 17,000 donors gave to the former Omaha labor leader in the third quarter, with an average contribution of $43.46. Osborn has said that he wouldn’t caucus with either party. 
“Dan Osborn has shown Nebraska voters exactly who he will side with in the Senate: the same Democrats funding his fake independent campaign,” said Will Coup, a Ricketts campaign spokesperson. 
Ricketts told the Examiner that he is “honored by the growing number of Nebraskans who have once again joined Team Ricketts as supporters, volunteers and donors.”
Osborn campaign manager John Dolan said Osborn has received support from Republicans, Democrats and nonpartisans who want to fix our broken politics and that he doesn’t “rely on daddy’s money to fund political campaigns,” a reference Osborn’s supporters have made in political ads against Ricketts. 
The Ricketts family owns Major League Baseball’s Chicago Cubs. His father, Joe, helped found the company that became TD Ameritrade. He worked at the company.
“Ricketts is funded by corporate giants like banks, foreign lobbyists, chemical manufacturers and railroads who are currently waiting for federal approval for an $85 billion merger,” Dolan said. 
Osborn’s team pointed to Ricketts’ support from corporate PACs, something the former union leader has sworn off accepting as evidence of a candidate they say takes money from special interests. 
Ricketts has received $242,200 from PACs, according to the latest fundraising reports. Some groups that donated to Ricketts are a PAC from tobacco giant Altria and another from the American Bankers Association. He also received $5,000 from Union Pacific.
Osborn’s campaign has accepted money from unions. The American Federation of Teachers, a teachers union, gave him $5,000, and People United PAC, a PAC focused on combating corporate interests in politics, donated four times to Osborn, ranging from $37 to $75.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin Democratic legislators and pro-democracy organizations held a rally Thursday afternoon outside the state Capitol to push for the creation of an independent commission tasked with drawing the state’s legislative maps. 
The renewed push for permanently taking the construction of Wisconsin’s political maps out of the hands of politicians comes amid a national debate about gerrymandering and as the state’s Democrats are outlining what state government will look like if they hold power in all three branches after next year’s midterm elections. 
Across the country, Democrats — who have for years been the party calling for a nonpartisan process for drawing political maps — are weighing the merits of “unilaterally disarming” by putting the drawing of maps in the hands of independent bodies in blue states while Republicans are redrawing maps in red states such as Texas in an explicit effort to hold on to their slim congressional majority. 
Next month, voters in California will weigh in on a referendum asking if the Democrats in control of the state’s government can temporarily bypass the independent map-drawing commission and redraw maps to benefit Democrats as a counter to the Republican effort in Texas. 
State Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison), a candidate in the Democratic primary for governor, told the Wisconsin Examiner after the Thursday rally that Wisconsin Democrats should push for a permanent resolution to the state’s map debate because a more effective counter to increasing authoritarianism than tit-for-tat congressional gerrymanders is creating systems that allow government to be more responsive to voters’ wishes. 
“Here in Wisconsin, what the people want are permanent fair maps, and that means keeping the decision of redistricting out of politicians’ hands and within a group of nonpartisan folks,” she said. “If we’re going to have representative democracy, that’s what we need. But we also have to remember to be proactive, and that’s why the permanent fair maps matter. And if we’re going to be responsive to an eroding democracy, that’s also how we should be empowering the people …” 
After Thursday’s rally, the advocates — including members of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, League of Women Voters of Wisconsin and Fair Maps Wisconsin Coalition — were going into the Capitol to deliver the draft of their plan to legislators. 
Under the plan, the state Department of Administration would be responsible for managing the selection of 18 independent redistricting commission members (15 acting members and three reserve members). 
The membership would be divided evenly between representatives of the two major political parties and unaffiliated. Members would not be allowed to hold other public offices and could not be a family member of a public office holder. Lobbyists and anyone who has donated more than $2,000 to a candidate for office in a year over the previous five years wouldn’t be allowed to sit on the commission. 
After the DOA selects a pool of 240 applicants, the majority and minority leaders of both legislative chambers would be allowed to strike down a certain number of candidates. 
The IRC would be required to hold public hearings while it deliberates on the maps. Approval of final maps would have to come through a two-thirds majority vote that includes votes from members representing the interests of both major parties and the independents. 
The plan includes a provision for members to rank proposed maps if such a “multi-partisan agreement” can’t be reached. 
Any proposed maps from the commission would need to still be approved by the Legislature and governor within 30 days. If maps aren’t approved, the Legislature or governor must provide a written explanation to the commission and the commission would have 15 days to respond or provide new maps. 
The Legislature and governor would have three attempts to approve maps before Aug. 15 of a redistricting year. If maps can’t be codified by then, anyone in the state would have the authority to file a lawsuit with the Wisconsin Supreme Court to adopt a commission-proposed map. 
Democrats said at the rally that they want to make sure the commission is crafted in a way that prevents meddling after the fact from politicians. Redistricting commissions in states such as Iowa and Ohio have been undermined once their proposals were subjected to the political process. 
Sen. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) said Republican legislators like the Iowa-style commission because if they vote down the commission’s proposals three times, the map-drawing authority returns to the Legislature. 
“They figured out the flaw in that model,” he said. “That is why we need a Wisconsin model, a Wisconsin model that works for all of us.”

“We’re looking to educate the public about the current housing affordability crisis,” said Marge Wisniewski, a member of the First United Methodist Church and a Resident Leader for Manufactured Housing Action. “You can’t buy homes. They’re too expensive. There’s just going to be a real tipping point where people are going to end up homeless before too long.”
On top of education, thirteen organizations from around the state will be present to encourage attendees to find an issue within housing affordability that appeals to them. Groups that will be present include Lakeshore Legal Aid, the Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness and the Housing Bureau for Seniors at the University of Michigan. 
Yvonne Cudney, the Community Outreach and Education Coordinator for the Housing Bureau for Seniors, will also give a presentation. 
“We want people to leave there and commit to do at least one small thing, to advance the cause,” Wisniewski said. Her organization, Manufactured Housing Action, will participate as well, advocating for increased regulation of private equity firms who own lots with manufactured homes and a bill to improve water quality in mobile home parks.

Wisniewski acknowledged the stigma around issues of affordable housing, within South Lyon and in neighborhoods across the state, and spoke to the importance in her daily life of having one-on-one conversations with her neighbors and friends about the issues. 
“We want to make people aware that, on any given day, people can be one bad day away from an eviction. You get sick, you lose your job, you can’t make your bills that month, it could be anybody. It could be your neighbor,” she said. “And because of the lack of affordable housing, you’re more at risk than ever.”
The event’s hosts at the South Lyon First United Methodist Church are also encouraging other Methodist churches, Wisniewski noted. She called the event in line with the social justice creed of the church, and “a very concrete way we can show love for our neighbor.”
“I’ve never seen a more active, engaged group of individuals in a faith community do something so profound and powerful,” she added.

Two weeks into the federal government shutdown, Congress is still deadlocked over temporary funding as Democrats insist on extending the credits that Congress created in 2021. 
Without those credits, 25,000 Idahoans are likely to cancel their insurance policies as average premiums are expected to double, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. And Idaho could lose 1,100 jobs next year if the credits expire, out of almost 340,000 job losses estimated across the U.S., an analysis published Thursday by the Commonwealth Fund found. 
Idaho Democratic Party Chair Lauren Nechocea says many families are learning they “will have to give up coverage altogether.”
“This is no accident,” she said in a statement. “The Trump regime and Idaho Republicans refused to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits that have kept coverage within reach for 117,000 Idahoans. Their carelessness means retirees, small business owners, and working parents will be forced to choose between health care and basic necessities.”

 How long is Your Health Idaho’s open enrollment?

Your Health Idaho’s open enrollment started Wednesday, and it ends Dec. 15. 
That gives Idahoans almost nine weeks to pick health insurance plans on the exchange for coverage starting Jan. 1, 2026. 
The exchange is a common place for people to buy private health insurance when their jobs don’t offer any, their employer’s policies are unaffordable, or people don’t qualify for public assistance like Medicaid or Medicare.
Here’s how to shop for insurance in Idaho:

Use an affordability calculator on Your Health Idaho’s website to explore plans at https://affordability.yourhealthidaho.org/#/
Find an agent or broker on Your Health Idaho’s website at https://www.yourhealthidaho.org/find-connector-help/ 

Kelly encourages people to get started shopping early, and not to wait until the last minute. 
 How much will Idaho health insurance premiums rise? 

In Idaho, average gross health insurance premiums on the exchange are expected to rise by 75%, or $100 a month, Kelly told the Sun. That’s because premiums are rising by 10% next year, and the tax credits could expire. 
The enhanced premium tax credits ensure people don’t pay more than 8.5% of their income on health insurance for benchmark plans. 
To learn more about how your insurance costs will change, Kelly recommended using Your Health Idaho’s tools online and working with agents and brokers.
“Everybody’s situation is so different,” Kelly said. “It’s really hard to comment on how it might be different in southeast Idaho versus North Idaho versus the Treasure Valley.” 
Here’s a few examples of how Idaho households could be affected, based on estimates from Your Health Idaho:

A family of four that earns $130,000 a year would see their annual premiums rise by $10,831 a year. Because they earn more than 400% of the federal poverty level, they wouldn’t be eligible for tax credits if the enhanced credits expire. Losing tax credits would cost them $7,800 a year, and their separate premium raise would cost them another $3,031 a year. 
A couple that earns $85,000 a year would see their premiums jump by $18,600 a year. They’d also lose credits, because they earn more than 400% of the federal poverty level, which is the cutoff for the smaller tax credits created through the Affordable Care Act.

The Nov. 4 elections will go a long way to shaping the cities, counties, school districts and other local taxing districts that affect Idahoans’ lives on a daily basis.
Depending on where they live, voters may have city council elections, a mayor’s race, school board elections, school district levies, a public safety levy, an open spaces levy, cemetery district, fire protection district or various other local elections and issues to decide.
Idahoans have multiple options for casting their vote in the Nov. 4 local elections. 
While absentee voting and early voting have already begun across the state, voters also have the option to instead vote in person at their local polling place from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. local time on Election Day, Nov. 4.
“Whether you vote early, absentee, or on Election Day, I encourage every eligible Idahoan to participate,” Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane said in a written statement. “Local elections play a critical role in shaping our communities.”

One of the easiest ways for Idahoans to check their voter registration status, request an absentee ballot for free, pre-register to vote, find out what is on their ballot and find directions to their polling place is by visiting the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office’s official election website, www.voteidaho.gov. 
Canyon County Clerk Rick Hogaboam is encouraging Idahoans to make a plan and vote in the upcoming election. 
“Please know there is time to request an absentee ballot up to October 24 and that registered voters can return their ballot by mail, if they prefer,” Hogaboam said in a written statement. “We also added an additional week for early voting. Please check the deadlines and plan accordingly among all the options for qualified voters to cast a ballot for the election.”
In addition to the Oct. 24 deadline to request an absentee ballot, there is also a deadline for absentee ballots to be received by election workers. All absentee ballots must be received by the voter’s local elections office by the time polls close at 8 p.m. on Nov. 4. It is not enough to drop the ballot in the mail and have it postmarked by Nov. 4; local elections officials must physically receive your ballot by the time polls close in order for your vote to count.
To register to vote, Idahoans will need a current photo ID and proof of residency. For the photo ID requirement, an Idaho driver’s license or Idaho ID card, a federal Tribal ID card, a passport or federal ID or an enhanced concealed weapons license issued by an Idaho sheriff’s office meet the requirements. For proof of residency, a proof of insurance card; a mortgage, lease or rental agreement; a utility bill other than a cell phone bill; a bank or credit card statement; a paycheck stub or an enrollment letter from an Idaho high school or university will work. More information about voter registration and voter registration requirements is available on the Vote Idaho website.

Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout ©2025Two Tennessee Republican gubernatorial candidates are pushing to expand the state’s private-school voucher program, but a third candidate says he would “suspend” the so-called scholarships, calling it “fiscally irresponsible.”
State Rep. Monty Fritts of Kingston told the Lookout this week he considers the governor’s new program unconstitutional and would try to block expansion on those grounds.
U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn and U.S. Rep. John Rose have said in various public comments they support vouchers. Blackburn is considered the favorite in the primary election that will take place in August 2026.
Fritts’ comments come after Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton recently said he wants to increase the number of $7,300 vouchers to 40,000 from the 20,000 approved by lawmakers this year. And Gov. Bill Lee said his only disappointment with the program is that it can’t reach more applicants. Some 42,000 filled out forms to get the new entitlement.
U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Lawmakers narrowly voted to hand out $144 million worth of vouchers during a January special session. Fritts was among more than 20 House Republicans who voted against the bill.
The state Constitution says the General Assembly “shall provide for the maintenance, support and eligibility standards for a system of free public schools,” according to Fritts. It doesn’t mention private schools, but he interprets that as a “specific and restrictive statement” that doesn’t permit spending public money to send kids to private schools.
“So to double it would be equally unconstitutional,” Fritts said. 
Even if the Constitution allows vouchers, Fritts considers the move “fiscally irresponsible.” 
“If I get elected, I plan to suspend it or end it. I’m sure that will bring some kind of lawsuit. I’m sure that will bring at least 20,000 unhappy people,” Fritts said.
The state projected that 66% of the students receiving the funds would be in private schools already. Fritts said he believes the number is higher.
Fritts clearly is not using the same playbook as Blackburn or Rose in the Republican primary.
Blackburn promised in a recent op-ed to fight for “parents’ rights in education” the same way she opposed a state income tax in the early 2000s when people drove around the Capitol honking horns in opposition and threw rocks at Gov. Don Sundquist’s office.
Asked where she stands on doubling the size of the program and whether it could hurt public school funding, Blackburn said in a statement to the Lookout, “Speaker Sexton is doing phenomenal work to expand Education Freedom Scholarships.” 
“A parent shouldn’t have to win the lottery to have a choice in their child’s education,” Blackburn said. “When it comes to expanding school choice, I won’t stop until every student in Tennessee has an equal opportunity to succeed.”
Rose takes a similar stance, not a rock-throwing one, but he says parents know what’s best for their children. In a Facebook post, he said his son is getting a “great” education at the public school in their hometown of Cookeville, yet adds, “As governor, I will defend your right to choose what works for your family.”
Rose campaign coordinator Chris Devaney said Thursday if evidence shows the “scholarships” are giving parents options and improving educational outcomes, then Rose backs expansion.
Moving students into private schools appears to be all the rage, whether they’re leaving inner-city Memphis or suburban Collierville schools.
The odd thing is that the more lawmakers get involved in Tennessee’s education system, adopting state standards and tests, the more people want to escape. Thus, the state is winding up paying for two school systems, separate and not necessarily equal. Didn’t they solve that with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954? Maybe not.
Hatcher challenging Ogles
Former Tennessee Agriculture Commissioner Charlie Hatcher broke the silence on the state’s worst-kept secret this week when he announced he’s running for the 5th Congressional District seat held by U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles. The 5th was redrawn in 2022, as part of the state Republicans’ successful gerrymander. It incorporates the west Nashville suburbs, Columbia, Franklin, Lebanon and a few rural Middle Tennessee counties. A veterinarian and owner of a family dairy, Hatcher said Washington, D.C. and President Donald Trump need someone with a farmer’s “hard-work mentality.”
“Trump would have been a fantastic farmer because he has that work ethic,” Hatcher said this week.
We’ll give Hatcher a pass on this one since it’s his initial announcement, but typically, hard work means doing more than calling your fixer to handle problems.

Anyway, the seven-year Agriculture commissioner and former member of the University of Tennessee Board of Trustees is geared up to run against Ogles, a former Maury County mayor and state director of Americans for Prosperity who has been in and out of the D.C. limelight for a variety of reasons.
He remains under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for discrepancies in campaign finance reporting. The panel found he likely violated federal campaign finance laws by reporting an inflated personal loan to make his bid for office look stronger in 2022. Ogles received permission from the committee to set up a fund to take donations to help him pay legal fees.
Ogles has about $58,000 in his campaign account and loans totaling more than $70,300. 
Hatcher hasn’t filed any reports yet. But odds are he’ll be able to raise more than Ogles – without playing numbers games.
Back in the hunt
Former Rutherford County Sheriff Robert Arnold, who served federal prison time for an e-cigarette scheme at the county jail, is running for the 4th Congressional District seat held by U.S. Rep. Scott DesJarlais, a rural district covering Murfreesboro, Lawrenceburg, Shelbyville, McMinnville and a long stretch of rural counties in Middle and East Tennessee.
Arnold, who was selected to run for sheriff in a 2010 Republican caucus meeting, plummeted from his elected post in 2017 after pleading to wire fraud, honest services fraud and extortion after allowing his chief administrative deputy to run a company called JailCigs in, you guessed it, the county jail.
To run for sheriff in the first place, key Republican lawmakers had to massage qualifications for the job because Arnold held a certificate of attendance at Oakland High School, not a full-fledged diploma.
Arnold defeated longtime Sheriff Truman Jones to win the job and probably could have kept it as long as he wanted. But arrogance and greed crept up on him, leading to the bright idea for an e-cigs company with a captive clientele.
At one point in the legal process, Arnold became so distraught he was placed on suicide watch at a Kentucky jail where he was held after violating bond for a scuffle with his wife. Once convicted, he was ordered to pay $52,000 in restitution to the county and sentenced to 50 months in prison but reportedly spent part of that time in a halfway house.
A felony conviction is not a disqualifier from serving in Congress – or being president.

Topping recently joined the Nashville law office of Holtzman Vogel, which specializes in political law, regulatory matters and high-stakes litigation. She will concentrate on election and political law compliance and ethics, according to the firm. 
Lord knows she has the patience of Job after working with Tennessee’s lawmakers.

(Photo by HHakim/Getty Images)The state of West Virginia is entering into a “first of its kind” public-private partnership with Diversified Energy to ensure oil and natural gas wells owned by the company are properly retired.
The collaboration, called the Mountain State Plugging Fund, will see Diversified invest $70 million toward plugging its non-producing wells across the state over the next 20 years. That $70 million will be put into a fund held by OneNexus, an “insurance provider of financial assurance for asset retirement obligations,” per a news release. The state of West Virginia will be designated as a third-party beneficiary for the fund.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey said the collaboration and the creation of this fund could help set a “new national standard for how energy producing states can lead with both strength and responsibility.” 
“We must be responsible stewards of the state’s environment. Historically, in West Virginia and across the country, it’s been a challenge to retire abandoned and orphaned gas wells in a responsible manner,” Morrisey said. “We know that these abandoned wells can pose a significant risk to our environment and to our people. Most of the time in the past, people would look to the taxpayers to bear that cost [of plugging them]. Well today we’re going to change that direction.”
Diversified expects to see at least 1,500 of its wells retired over the next 20 years through the investment, according to Diversified Energy CEO Rusty Hutson, Jr. By 2046, the company plans to increase its plugging capacity to 250 wells annually.
As part of the collaboration, Hutson said Diversified will “bolster” its resources for Next LVL Energy, a Diversified subsidiary located in Bridgeport. Morrisey said the investment will create between 50 and 100 new jobs with an average salary of $75,000 plus benefits.
Hutson said Diversified would like to see other oil and natural gas companies join the effort to plug wells responsibly when they’re taken offline.
Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Harold Ward said earlier this year that there are more than 21,000 abandoned and orphaned wells in the state of West Virginia that can pose varying levels of environmental or health risks for the people and communities near them. 
Those risks include oil and gas leaks, methane emissions and groundwater contamination that can impact drinking water, among other things.
Oil and natural gas wells are considered to be abandoned in West Virginia if they are idle for 12 months or more. If there is no known operator for the wells — thousands have been created over the last 150 years — then they are considered orphaned. It is the state’s responsibility to remediate these wells.
According to the abandoned well mapping tool from the DEP, the cost of plugging each well varies, but generally comes in near or above $100,000.
A majority of wells plugged in the state are paid for using federal dollars allocated over recent years, specifically through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. Per the DEP, both of those federal programs — passed and allocated under former President Joe Biden — are a “significant boon” for the state’s attempts to identify and plug abandoned wells as they provide “substantial” funding to West Virginia that is “crucial” to supporting the state Office of Oil and Gas.
State funds — allocated to the OOG through industry permit fees, bond forfeitures and severance taxes — also go toward plugging wells, but existing bond rates are too low to cover the costs, leaving the remaining fees on taxpayers.
State money covered plugging 18 abandoned wells in 2023 and about 32 in 2024, per the DEP.
Meanwhile, federal funds covered plugging more than 200 abandoned or orphaned wells in 2023 and 2024 respectively. If the federal funding from the IIJA remains active and available, it’s estimated that the state will be able to plug at least 1,200 abandoned wells through 2030.

She's seen here at the National Guard Adjutants General conference at the Colorado National Guard’s 168th Regional Training Site at Fort Carson last year. (U.S. Army National Guard photo by Sgt. 1st Class Zach Sheely)U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Laura Clellan will retire from her post as adjutant general of Colorado on Saturday with a ceremony that passes the responsibility of heading the state’s National Guard over to U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Robert Davis.
Clellan was appointed to the job in July 2020 by Gov. Jared Polis. Colorado’s National Guard comprises about 5,500 citizen soldiers and airmen who commit one weekend per month to train for missions, such as responses to natural disasters and military operations around the world. The guard holds both state and federal missions.
Colorado Newsline interviewed Clellan at guard headquarters in Centennial during the week ahead of her retirement. As readers will see toward the end of this interview, Clellan declined to discuss political topics, including President Donald Trump’s recent deployment of guard units from other states to American cities.
This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
Colorado Newsline: Why retire now? What led to this decision?
Laura Clellan: It’s been in my plan, actually, but it just so happens that it’s crazy times, which I never expected. I initially told the governor three years when I came on in 2020, and I kind of thought that I’d go back to my job in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, because I loved working there. And then he asked me when he was reelected if I would stay, and I said “Yeah, you know, I’m having a blast.”
This is a great job, and I feel like I’m making a difference. And so I stayed another year, and I started thinking and looking across the bench of officers that were ready to compete for this job, realizing that I needed to have a plan to move out so that they could have a chance. And so that’s why I chose this year. Last summer, I knew that this would be the year. I wanted to make sure that I had a good bench of people that were able to compete for this job.
So you made the decision last summer, not knowing that things would be a bit chaotic with the (federal government) shutdown.
I made the decision that this would be the year. I didn’t necessarily know it was going to be October. Turns out, maybe October wasn’t the best month.
How is the shutdown making things chaotic?
We’ve got over 600 people working without getting paid right now. And then we have guard members drilling or planning on drilling that won’t get paid unless (Congress) actually frees up some money. I know they’re working on it, but that’s a hard pill to swallow, especially for a part-time force to say, “Hey, come in and drill this weekend. Take time away from your family, but you’re not going to get a paycheck, and we don’t know when you’re going to get it.” The stress on the people of the organization is hard and so we’re trying to make this as easy as possible.










At the end of the day, people wear this uniform and they come to work here even as civilians, because they're mission driven and they care about the mission. It’s a testament to the people of this organization.


– Maj. Gen. Laura Clellan, adjutant general of Colorado


When you reflect on your time as head of the National Guard, what were some of your biggest moments of challenge?
I came in right in the middle of COVID-19 and after the George Floyd Black Lives Matter protest, which the guard was called in for right before I got there, and the tempo of operations was really high. We were already in the middle of helping with the COVID response, and that just continued to increase.
And five years ago today, we were also dealing with some of the largest wildfires we’ve seen with the Cameron Peak and East Troublesome fires. Those were in October 2020 and we were called up for that.
We just continued this high tempo of supporting domestic operations, but we were also deploying folks overseas to help with operations in the Middle East. It was just such a busy time, and that was the most challenging part.
We were dipping in and out of virtual work and trying to keep everyone safe, and when I think about that timeframe, it was so stressful for the workforce. And then throw on top of that the vaccine mandate, and the stress with people who didn’t want to get it and refused to get it. It was a very challenging time, and most of it was just because of the stress on the people part of the workforce, but we were also continuing to meet every mission, and we didn’t miss a beat.

What do you think contributed to your ability to just hit the ground running like that?
At the end of the day, people wear this uniform and they come to work here even as civilians, because they’re mission driven and they care about the mission. It’s a testament to the people of this organization. I think we tend to be a little bit more resilient as well. There’s a lot of stress in the military, I think, compared to the general population, so we can manage through stress a little bit easier.
When you think back to the COVID response, and especially vaccine deployment in 2021, what sticks out to you as challenges and successes?
The gov’s office asked us for help, and we gave them some individuals that could help with operations and planning. We gave them some really good planners. I gave up one of my general officers to go head the task force for the vaccine when they rolled that out. That’s something that we’re really proud of — we know how to do operations and planning, so we put a lot of talent down at the governor’s office, and I think that they really appreciated it, and I think it just helped build that relationship between our agency and the governor’s staff.
I met a few folks that volunteered the whole time, which was 840 or so days. We ran most of our missions on volunteers. There were a couple of times where we had to surge and actually call up a unit, like right during the Marshall Fire. We called up our response force for the Marshall Fire, and at the same time, we were on the phone talking to the governor about calling up 200 more people for this ramp-up and testing because COVID hit a wave at the same time, in January 2022.

How do you stay focused during dual crises like that and not allow that to be overwhelming?
My past deployments and my past experience helped. Many of us have deployed overseas several times, and those are sometimes life or death situations. Our most stressful time here wasn’t as stressful as my time in Afghanistan, if that puts it into perspective.
What would you single out as your biggest success over your five years?
I came in and the Army was really focused on people and culture, because of the murder of Vanessa Guillén at Fort Hood. The army was really focused on getting rid of toxic behavior, of sexual assault and racial harassment. So it was really easy for me to come in and just continue that work, and really bring the organization to a point where we were intentionally working on the culture of our organization.
We started a process where we took a survey tool that was out there for us to use, but we just didn’t use it very often, and we decided to use it sort of like a Gallup survey. It’s about the process of getting feedback, leaders taking that feedback, using it to make improvements and then rechecking with follow-ups.
Editor’s note: Vanessa Guillén, a 20-year-old United States Army soldier, was killed at Fort Hood in April 2020. Another soldier who authorities believed killed her died by suicide before he could be prosecuted. Guillén had told friends and family that she was sexually harassed by a superior, but she did not report it officially.
What did you learn from that initial survey?
We had our own share of sexually-harassing behavior and racially-harassing behavior. We also had some feedback that said our frontline supervisors were pretty good. Those were some of the trends.
Then at the lowest leader level, we tried to get after addressing that feedback. So, it wasn’t me addressing it as much as it was leaders. I said, “Use this feedback from your people and do something with it, and then tell them what you’re doing and have them be part of it.”
It took a couple of years for us to really get leaders to buy into that process, but then the military writ large started using the same survey and basically mandating the same process that we instituted. So now it’s operationalized, and we’re still using it.
I would say for the most part — we’re not 100% there — but for the most part, our leaders know the benefit of asking for feedback, getting it, and actually doing something with it to make your organization better.
Have there been changes in that sexually- and racially-harassing behavior you mentioned?
Absolutely. Those numbers have dropped significantly over the last five years. After the first two years of working on those feedback comments, we saw a major drop in those behaviors.
Can you pinpoint a reason for that decline?
It was policy change, but it was also asking for soldiers and airmen to help address the issues. Commanders did these sensing sessions and working groups, and so a lot of the actions that were taken were recommendations from the soldiers and airmen themselves.
People felt heard. I think also when you talk about these things, and when leaders understand that these things are going on within their work groups, then every leader at every level can start really looking out for those issues and be more aware of it.










People have to understand that first and foremost, the National Guard are Coloradans — they're neighbors, they're teachers, they're lawyers, they're doctors, they're dentists. They're construction workers and handymen and college students. We’re from the community.


– Maj. Gen. Laura Clellan, adjutant general of Colorado


So it’s a transparency focus?
Absolutely. And what I saw at my level was that we started getting lower on these issues. One of the other things that we did at the organizational level was we took everybody that was focused on people — so behavioral health, chaplains, the prevention workforce, domestic violence prevention, suicide prevention, sexual assault prevention, financial health, family support programs — we took all of those people that were spread out across the organization and put them under one umbrella. We call it our resiliency directorate, and it’s paid huge dividends. A couple other states had done it, so we found out their best practices and then did it ourselves. It’s been huge.
What do you wish the average Coloradan understood about the National Guard?
People have to understand that first and foremost, the National Guard are Coloradans — they’re neighbors, they’re teachers, they’re lawyers, they’re doctors, they’re dentists. They’re construction workers and handymen and college students. We’re from the community.
I like to say that the National Guard is not the job for most people that pay the mortgage. It’s a part-time job.
The number one reason we exist, first and foremost, is to fight and win the nation’s wars. We’re a military entity, and we deploy right alongside the active duty. The unique thing about the National Guard, though, is that we also have the ability to support our community and our state. The active duty doesn’t do that. So in times of disasters, floods, fires, COVID, snow, storms — you name it — we’re there.

Davis will succeed Clellan as adjutant general of Colorado. (U.S. Army National Guard photo by Spc. Ashley Low/Public domain)
What do you hope the incoming adjutant general continues from your leadership?
The main thing is just the focus on people and what we have built, as far as the culture we’ve worked hard on with the survey process and getting commanders really involved in understanding that they can contribute to their culture. People want to be part of an organization because they like the organization, that there’s a sense of belonging and there’s a mission and a purpose, right? And I know General Davis coming in will absolutely continue that focus.
What are you looking forward to in retirement?
I love to be on my bicycle, so I plan to get reacquainted with my bicycles, plural. I’d like to snowboard during the week and avoid traffic. And I’ve got two dogs that love to go hiking and snowshoeing.
I understand that you don’t want to answer any political questions, but I want to give you an opportunity to respond to the politicized nature of the National Guard and how that’s impacted your tenure and your leadership.
As somebody who wears a uniform, we have to remain nonpartisan. The National Guard has a homeland, domestic mission for sure, and you’ve seen how we’ve been used in the past — floods, fires, crises — and I hope that use continues.

Yet here we are.
More than 100 days past the June 30 deadline, Harrisburg is still at an impasse, leaving Pennsylvania’s 48 rape crisis centers in an existential crisis of their own. Philadelphia’s only rape crisis center has paused its services. Across the state, others are scaling back, depriving survivors of the life-saving advocacy that helps them navigate hospitals, police departments, courtrooms, and other complex systems in the aftermath of assault.
I wish I had more options to stand up for survivors without reopening my own wounds. But after months of political gridlock, I fear that unless lawmakers hear directly from those who rape crisis centers serve, they will continue to write survivors off as another line in a spreadsheet that can wait.
Survivors can’t wait. I know firsthand.
I first met an advocate from Pittsburgh Action Against Rape (PAAR) in August 2021 in an exam room at Magee-Womens Hospital. I had just arrived there in the backseat of a squad car after being assaulted by a stranger on the Allegheny River Trail during my lunch break. Gravel from the fight still clung to my skin as I walked into the emergency room alone.
Not long after I was admitted, a woman appeared at my bedside. She introduced herself as an advocate from PAAR. Her job was to explain every step of the medical, legal, and recovery process ahead — and to make sure I was taken care of along the way. She made it clear that I could choose to consent — or not consent — to any part of the experience.
That I could make decisions about what happened to my body next had not occurred to me until that moment. Her advocacy restored my sense of agency, which had been stripped the moment I encountered my assaulter. And her presence reminded me I was no longer on my own.
I told her I was 10 weeks pregnant. She calmly described what the nurses would do to protect the pregnancy and what to expect from the forensic exam. Later, she explained what the criminal investigation would entail. She said she could stay in touch for as long as I needed — not only through the hospital visit but through the entire legal process.
PAAR gave me a critical resource that many survivors navigating crisis today no longer have: a trained counselor, funded in part by the commonwealth, whose job was to protect my well-being, dignity, and choices.
Over the months that followed, my advocate communicated with the district attorney so I could prepare for the baby and maintain some normalcy. As we prepared for trial, she held my hand and warned me when I might face triggering evidence. When I testified in court, she physically stood between me and my assailant.
When the jury reached its verdict, she called me with the news. The man who assaulted me had been convicted and would serve a lengthy prison sentence. Together, we cried — it was almost over.
Weeks later, she read my victim impact statement to the judge at a sentencing hearing while I nursed my newborn daughter at home.
I couldn’t have survived this trauma without the help of a rape crisis center, and I mean that literally. There is no version of me — dazed, traumatized, and pregnant — who could have navigated a criminal case without that support. My advocate made justice possible without breaking me in the process.
Rape crisis centers aren’t optional. They’re part of the state’s public-safety infrastructure — the quiet system that helps people report crimes, preserve evidence, and cooperate with law enforcement. Defunding them through legislative inaction doesn’t just fail survivors; it weakens justice for everyone.
Today, advocates like mine are being laid off. Helplines are going unanswered. Survivors are facing the daunting recovery process without guidance.
The legislature’s abandonment of Pennsylvanians has placed survivors like me in the unjust—and re-traumatizing—position of pleading our cases to state leaders in Harrisburg after already doing so in court.
Every day the state budget remains stalled, another survivor will sit alone in an exam room, wondering how they will survive what comes next. I urge Pennsylvania’s elected leaders to pass the budget immediately so she doesn’t have to do it alone.

(Photo by Erin Hemme Froslie/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota No Kings rally organizers say they expect bigger crowds on Saturday than events held in June because people are feeling ignored by federal lawmakers.
Ten No Kings protests are planned in cities across North Dakota with more than 2,000 events scheduled nationwide. The national movement emphasizes that America does not believe in kings or dictators, but the power belongs to the people.
Olivia Schloegel, one of the Jamestown event organizers, said citizens call and submit comments to members of North Dakota’s congressional delegation, but they don’t feel heard.
Schloegel moved to Jamestown in 2018 as a federal worker for the U.S. Department of the Interior. Though she no longer works for the government, she said she is disheartened by the treatment of federal workers under President Donald Trump’s second term.
“Our federal services and workforce is being gutted at such an extreme and destructive pace,” Schloegel said. “The checks and balances I learned about in high school government do not seem to be honored.”
Nikki Tickerhoof, an organizer for the No Kings protest in Minot, said the Air Force base is important to the community, and residents are worried about impacts from the federal government shutdown. Trump issued a memo on Wednesday directing military service members to be paid on Oct. 15. However, the memo is unclear if funds will be available to pay service members at the end of October. 
“A lot of the families that I know of, they are already struggling as it is,” Tickerhoof said.

While she doesn’t expect any major incidents to occur, Tickerhoof said she requested additional law enforcement to be in the protest area to ensure safety.
Fargo’s No Kings rally drew about 3,000 people in June, according to organizer Lyn Dockter-Pinnick. Since then, frustrations have grown with federal actions, including National Guard soldiers being deployed to American cities, she said.
“We do expect the same, or more, people because of the dire situation that we’re finding ourselves in,” Dockter-Pinnick said.
The Fargo event will feature speakers from the AFL-CIO labor union, American Civil Liberties Union and other community activists.  
The Bismarck No Kings event will feature a “free speech minute” where participants will be able to use a microphone or bullhorn to deliver a one-minute statement.
The protest in Williston will feature a keynote speech from former Democratic-NPL Party U.S. House candidate Trygve Hammer.
LuAnn Casler, an organizer for the Williston event, said about 150 people participated in June, and she expects more on Saturday.
“People were clamoring,” Casler said. “We had people from Montana, people from Canada that came.”
Dockter-Pinnick said participants are focused on having a peaceful protest.
“We’re not showing up with guns, or knives, or weapons,” she said. “We’re showing up only with our souls full of worry about our country.”

(Marcelo Hernandez/Getty Images)Dr. Ralph Abraham, Louisiana’s surgeon general, made it abundantly clear why the state would not promote the flu vaccine or hold events offering it to the public. It’s the second year in a row the health department has opted against such efforts.
Asked by the Illuminator at a news conference earlier this month, Abraham said his agency was “not going to do anything” to make the vaccine available at health fairs or other community events. Until Republican Gov. Jeff Landry took office in January 2024, administrations under both parties historically backed health department outreach to limit the impact of flu season.
The most recent statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention counted 470,000 hospitalizations and 28,000 deaths related to the flu during the 2023-24 season.
An internet search produced 2024-25 flu season – the first under the Landry administration – statewide flu activity was “high” – a score of 10    
Abraham said he doesn’t support mass flu vaccine events because they don’t allow for a patient to give “informed consent,” which involves a doctor explaining the pros and cons of a vaccine with the patient before that person decides whether they want to be vaccinated.
The surgeon general’s stance is problematic for multiple reasons.
First, Abraham would have to assume the average patient doesn’t do their own homework on whether the flu vaccine is right for them. Such research might include information from the Louisiana Department of Health website, which states: “Flu vaccines are safe and effective and the best way to prevent spreading seasonal flu.”
There’s also the matter of health care access. As of 2023, more than 212,000 adults and 38,000 children did not have health insurance coverage according to estimates from the Louisiana Health Insurance Survey. This means they potentially might not have had access to a flu shot except through a state-sponsored free vaccination event.
If Abraham had some irrefutable evidence that suggests the flu vaccine doesn’t work or, worse yet, is harmful, his position might have merit. But he’s acknowledged, as a practicing family physician, giving the shot to his own patients. 
“I’m not an anti-flu vaxxer,” Abraham said.
“I work in the poorest part of the state,” he added. “That doesn’t mean my patients are not smart. They are very intelligent, and when given the right data, they can make the right decision.”
But what about the people who have no decision to make because the state has eliminated perhaps the only opportunity they had to obtain a flu vaccine?
Through their highly questionable choice to shutter state flu vaccine campaigns, Dr. Abraham and the Landry administration have replaced “informed consent” with “only if we say it’s OK.”
We expect unsound public health policy without rationale or evidence from the likes of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has no background in medicine. But it’s disappointing coming from a longtime Louisiana physician who’s taken an oath to act for the benefit of the sick and do no harm",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Man-getting-shot.jpg,,,2025-10-17 06:56:12.478065

Ron Johnson’s Madison office in 2021. (Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)There is no clear frontrunner in the Democratic primary for governor of Wisconsin. Attorney General Josh Kaul, with his name recognition and two statewide wins under his belt, might have been the favorite, except that he decided not to get in. Now former Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler has announced he won’t be using his star power and prodigious fundraising skills to take a run at the governor’s mansion.
I caught up with Wikler Thursday by phone while he was at home with his kids, working on a book about Wisconsin and national politics and fielding phone calls from reporters about his decision to stay out of the race. Despite his decision, Wikler is still involved in politics behind the scenes, raising money and helping create an infrastructure to support his party’s eventual nominee for governor as well as Democrats who are trying to win seats in the Legislature and in Congress.
Wikler deserves a lot of credit for the recent hopeful direction of politics in Wisconsin — culminating in the election of a liberal state Supreme Court majority that forced an end to gerrymandered voting maps which previously locked in hugely disproportionate Republican legislative majorities in our 50/50 state. His vision for a progressive political revival in Wisconsin and across the nation delighted a lot of grassroots Democrats as well as Jon Stewart of “The Daily Show”, who urged him to run for president after listening to Wikler describe what Democrats need to do to reconnect with working class voters and turn the political tide.
As Wisconsin Republicans coalesce around U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, a yes-man for President Donald Trump, the stakes in the Wisconsin governor’s race could not be higher. But Wikler says he’s not worried.
“I think there are multiple candidates who can absolutely win and could do a perfect job on our side,” he said on the phone. “I don’t see the same on the Republican side. I think Tom Tiffany is a real political misfire for the GOP in a moment like this.”  
“I have a real conviction that we have a very clear path to be able to win. Not without a fight — this is Wisconsin — but I would rather be Team Democrats and democracy and an economy that works for working people than Team MAGA and tariffs and authoritarian masked men grabbing people off the street.”
Still, on a recent weekend drive through the Driftless Area, I saw huge Trump banners flying over fields of soybeans farmers can’t sell because of Trump’s trade war with China. It might be hard for some voters, even those who are hurt by Trump administration policies, to switch teams as people’s core sense of identity is so tied to polarized political team loyalties.










... in Wisconsin things don’t have to change very much to get a dramatically different result.”


– Ben Wikler


“I think it’s true for all of us that it’s hard to come to the conclusion that it’s time to change after you’ve been going one way for a good while,” Wikler said. “But it’s also the case that in Wisconsin things don’t have to change very much to get a dramatically different result.”
Elections in this swing state will continue to be close. “But there’s every possibility of being able to energize and turn out several percentage points more people in a way that could generate a Democratic trifecta and help flip the U.S. House and shift power in local offices across the state,” he added.
In his unsuccessful bid for national Democratic Party chair, Wikler talked about how Democrats had lost working class votes and needed to reclaim their lost status as champions of working people. They needed to “show the receipts” for their work winning better health care, affordable housing, more opportunity and a better quality of life for the people that used to be their natural constituency, he said.
On “The Daily Show” he held up Gov. Tony Evers as an example, saying he ran on the promise to “fix the damn roads” and beat former Gov. Scott Walker. Then he fixed the roads and won a second time.
But a lot of progressives, especially public school advocates, were disappointed with the budget deals Evers struck with Republicans. This week DPI released final numbers showing that 71% of public schools across the state will get less money from the state under the current budget. Where are the receipts Wisconsin Democrats can show to make the case they will make things better?
Evers blocked a lot of bad things, Wikler noted. And in many ways things are better in Wisconsin, even as the national scene gets darker and darker under the current administration, he said. “The things that are going well are the kind of locally driven and state-level things that are not falling apart,” he said. He contrasted that with the Walker years when “there was a sense that core aspects of people’s personal lives were falling apart. People were leaving their careers in education and changing their whole life plans, because it felt like the pillars that supported their vision for how their lives were going to work were falling apart.”
There’s a “profound sense of threat” from Washington today, he added. But he believes that Democrats can stave off disaster in Wisconsin if they win a “trifecta” in state government, which he thinks is possible.
He draws on examples from the state’s history as a progressive leader, from the  famous 1911 legislative session that laid the groundwork for the New Deal to the first law protecting victims of domestic violence in the 1970s.
“There’s these moments when Wisconsin really leaps forward. And we have a chance for the first one in more than half a century in 2027,” he said. “And that’s the  moment where you have to deliver for people really meaningfully.”
He compares the chance of that happening in Wisconsin to the “Minnesota miracle,” when Tim Walz was re-elected governor and Democrats swept state government in our neighboring state. 
Trying to bring about a miraculous transformation in Wisconsin doesn’t mean Wikler is unrealistic. You don’t have to look any farther than Wisconsin’s southern neighbor, Illinois, to see the dystopian possibilities of our current politics. “I don’t think the way [Illinois] Gov. JB Pritzker is talking is alarmist at all,” Wikler says. “If you talk to people who fought for democracy in countries where it disappeared, the early days of the downfall look like what we’re seeing right now.”
To resist, we have to do multiple things, he said — fight in the courts, fight in downballot races, protect election administration “but also keep in mind that ultimately, the people whose votes you have to win are the people who already feel like democracy is not working for them. They think that all politicians are already corrupt, and warnings about the threats to democracy feels like just more partisan blather. And you have to connect with their lived experience and the things that they think about when they’re not thinking about politics. That’s where fixing the roads becomes the only way to get off the road to authoritarianism.”
Sounds like a good plan to me.

The Washington Center will accomplish this goal while also providing students with instruction on America’s founding and a focus on classical education.”
The legislation didn’t outline any other required dates for the center to be up and running.
“WVU and the Governor’s Office are in the process of finalizing the appointment of the director of the Washington Center. We expect to make an announcement soon, and then have the center up and running,” Shauna Johnson, WVU’s executive director of strategic communications, said in an email.
Del. Pat McGeehan, R-Brooke, who sponsored the Washington Center legislation, declined to comment, saying he’d leave a formal announcement to the governor’s office. 
His bill, House Bill 3297, passed by the GOP-led legislature in April, though some Democratic lawmakers — and WVU alumni — raised concerns about a political appointee overseeing academics. 
The bill mandated that WVU operate the “Washington Center for Civics, Culture and Statesmanship” focused on teaching constitutional studies and “great debates of Western civilization.” It will also present the “fact-based instruction on America’s founding,” according to the governor’s office.
“The center shall equip students with the skills, habits and dispositions of mind they need to reach their own informed conclusions on matters of social and political importance,” the measure said. 
According to the bill, the director “shall be an expert on the western tradition, the American founding, and American constitutional thought, and shall have publicly demonstrated, through speeches, publications, or presentations, a commitment to the purposes, goals, and policies of the center.” 
The director’s term will be for five years and renewable, and he or she will report to the WVU president and other university leaders. 
The director is tasked with overseeing the Washington Center, including managing and recruiting staff, overseeing its curriculum and the program’s budget. 
While the bill initially didn’t come with funding for the center’s director and faculty, the final budget bill contained $1.5 million for WVU to use on the center. 
Along with a director, the bill requires the university to have five additional faculty at the center, which comes in the wake of WVU eliminating around 300 faculty and staff jobs for financial reasons. 
The Washington Center can use existing faculty and courses to accomplish the bill’s requirements of civics instruction.

Soon, their hard work will be memorialized at the Grand Island attraction in a bronze sculpture crafted by an renowned artist.
This week, sculptor Benjamin Victor will be working at the Stuhr Museum to craft a clay model of a Pawnee woman and her infant child. It is an initial step toward placing a bronze sculpture along a pathway to the museum’s popular Pawnee Earth Lodge.
The Earth Lodge, where schoolchildren are given living history demonstrations about how the Pawnee lived on the plains of Nebraska, was recently renovated and rebuilt due to a donation by the Wilsons’ two sons, Jim and John, as a memorial to their parents.
That led to discussion of a more permanent memorial that culminated in engaging Victor, an Idaho-based sculptor who has done four works for National Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol, including the bronze of Ponca Chief Standing Bear. The idea was to honor Pawnee history and culture.
The culmination of Victor’s visit with be on Saturday, when he “live” sculpts from 1-5 p.m., using a Pawnee/Lakota/Santa Ana Pueblo model, Ana Eva Warne, who will be accompanied by her mother, Maylynn Riding.
Bonnie Smith, executive director of the Stuhr Museum Foundation, said Saturday’s event will let visitors see “history in the making” and help them learn more about two instrumental and dogged museum volunteers.
“Jim and John Wilson wanted to provide a significant acknowledgment of their parents,” Smith said. “They wanted to make sure that people knew that by volunteering you can make a difference.”
She added, “It’s not always your money,” she added. “It can be your time.”
Exactly when the Pawnee sculpture will be installed has not yet been determined.
Several other events are scheduled for Saturday, including three showings of a Ken Burns film, “The American Revolution.” Admission Saturday is free. For more information, refer to the websites: www.stuhrmuseum.org and www.benjaminvictor.com.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)At 5 a.m. in Idaho’s rural river valleys and mountain foothills, the day begins quietly but with essential work. Guides check river levels, wax skis, fuel trucks, saddle horses and pack coolers. At the same time nearby, a U.S. Forest Service ranger, a trail crew member, a Bureau of Land Management permit checker is doing the same — unlocking gates, checking conditions, loading boats, or planning the work that keeps our public lands open to all.
These federal employees serve Idahoans and the public lands we love. Permit administrators navigate complex rules so businesses can operate responsibly. Trail crews and recreation staff clear downfall, repair signs, clear landslides, and keep sites clean. Rangers answer hard questions from our outfitters and guides while seeking solutions with patience and professionalism, even when they don’t agree. They are doing the hard work needed to ensure our public lands remain places we can love, recreate and work.
National parks, public lands feared at risk of long-term harm as shutdown drags on

During this government shutdown, many of those professionals in the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management are either furloughed or working without pay. They didn’t ask for this hardship, and they certainly don’t deserve it. For many of Idaho’s federal workers, a missed paycheck raises questions about putting food on the table or paying the mortgage, and yet they still show up and serve the public.
In Idaho’s rural communities, when federal paychecks pause, the pain extends far beyond the agency office door. It’s felt at the grocery store, the diner, the auto repair bay, even in the school fundraiser jar. Federal employees live in the same rural towns as Idaho’s outfitters and guides — places where every dollar circulates close to home, and a missed paycheck ripples through the community. 
While we don’t have the ability to open the government, we can lean into what Idaho does best — neighbors helping neighbors. If you’re able, support local businesses and community organizations stepping up for families feeling the squeeze. In a small town, steady support goes a long way.
A reliable, responsible recreation economy doesn’t happen by accident. It happens because guides, outfitters, federal agency staff, volunteers, and local businesses show up day after day, season after season, working together for the good of Idaho. We don’t  agree on every policy, but we do agree on the essentials: We care about our public lands, we care about access, and we care about the gateway communities where we all live. 
So as those who love Idaho’s public lands, outfitters, guides, and the general public, let’s support the federal employees who steward them. Let’s support the gateway communities where they live. 
Finally, to those who have the ability to end this shutdown, it’s time to work together to find common sense solutions that allow everyone to get back to work. Our rural communities and the outfitters who live there depend on them.

They will join thousands of protests in other states, part of a second round of demonstrations against actions that organizers say are “terrorizing our communities” and driving up the cost of living.
Thousands turn out for Arkansas ‘No Kings’ protests

Millions of people participated in the first No Kings rallies and marches on June 14, which coincided with a military parade in Washington D.C. and President Donald Trump’s birthday. The June protests happened against a backdrop of growing anger over what some saw as Trump’s attacks on everything from international trade to immigration to higher education.
Since then, Trump has “doubled down” by pressuring Republican states to eliminate Democratic seats in the House of Representatives via mid-decade redistricting; attacking health care and education, and continuing with aggressive immigration enforcement operations, according to No Kings organizers.
In Arkansas, Saturday’s protests come as the risk for severe weather ratchets up. There is a low risk for tornadoes, golf ball-sized hail and winds between 60 and 80 miles per hour across the state, according to the National Weather Service.
Storms are expected to start around midday Saturday, when many of the protests are scheduled, and will track across the state in the afternoon.
In Little Rock, the protest coincides with the 13th annual Central Arkansas PRIDEFest and Parade. Following a rally at 10 a.m., protesters will join the festival’s parade at 11 a.m. in a “solidarity march.”
The People’s Protests and Marches of AR is hosting the Little Rock rally. Scott Holladay, a member of the group’s organizing committee, said they have been carefully watching Saturday’s weather forecasts.
“We did take a poll of our organizers, and we decided that if it’s drizzling, then we would march anyway,” Holladay said.
Central Arkansas Pride, Indivisible LRCA and 50501 Arkansas are also listed as organizers of the Little Rock protest on the No Kings website.

Protests like the one in Little Rock draw people from rural parts of the state “that are looking for a place to join a group and be part of the movement,” with some protesters driving 40 to 60 miles to attend, Holladay said.
Organizers are “reluctant to cancel” but “don’t want to jeopardize anybody’s health and safety,” Holladay said. Event organizers will do what they can to move the protest time if more severe weather, such as thunderstorms and lightning, remain in the forecast, he said.
“We’re just going to do our best and try not to get people caught out in an unsafe situation,” Holladay said.
Maritza Munich, co-leader of Indivisible NWA, also said the protest her group is organizing in Rogers would go forward as long as the weather remained relatively mild. Munich has been in active communication with others and said an official decision on whether the protest would go forward would come once there was more certainty about the forecast. Munich said she was hopeful the earlier start time for Rogers’ protest — 9:30 a.m. — would help them avoid the worst weather.
“Some news reports have the weather, the more concerning weather, moving into here into the afternoon,” Munich said. “If there are some sprinkles, we won’t worry about it. But if we are looking at severe weather, we’re responsible people and we’ll do the responsible thing.”

When the Supreme Court recently allowed immigration agents in the Los Angeles area to take race into consideration during sweeps, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that citizens shouldn’t be concerned.
“If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote, “they promptly let the individual go.”
But that is far from the reality many citizens have experienced. Americans have been dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot by immigration agents. They’ve had their necks kneeled on. They’ve been held outside in the rain while in their underwear. At least three citizens were pregnant when agents detained them. One of those women had already had the door of her home blown off while Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem watched.

ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.

About two dozen Americans have said they were held for more than a day without being able to phone lawyers or loved ones.
Videos of U.S. citizens being mistreated by immigration agents have filled social media feeds, but there is little clarity on the overall picture. The government does not track how often immigration agents hold Americans.
So ProPublica created its own count.
We compiled and reviewed every case we could find of agents holding citizens against their will, whether during immigration raids or protests. While the tally is almost certainly incomplete, we found more than 170 such incidents during the first nine months of President Donald Trump’s second administration.
Among the citizens detained are nearly 20 children, including two with cancer. That includes four who were held for weeks with their undocumented mother and without access to the family’s attorney until a congresswoman intervened.
Immigration agents do have authority to detain Americans in limited circumstances. Agents can hold people whom they reasonably suspect are in the country illegally. We found more than 50 Americans who were held after agents questioned their citizenship. They were almost all Latino.
Immigration agents also can arrest citizens who allegedly interfered with or assaulted officers. We compiled cases of about 130 Americans, including a dozen elected officials, accused of assaulting or impeding officers.
These cases have often wilted under scrutiny. In nearly 50 instances that we have identified so far, charges have never been filed or the cases were dismissed. Our count found a handful of citizens have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors.
Among the detentions in which allegations have not stuck, masked agents pointed a gun at, pepper sprayed and punched a young man who had filmed them searching for his relative. In another, agents knocked over and then tackled a 79-year-old car wash owner, pressing their knees into his neck and back. His lawyer said he was held for 12 hours and wasn’t given medical attention despite having broken ribs in the incident and having recently had heart surgery.
In a third case, agents grabbed and handcuffed a woman on her way to work who was caught up in a chaotic raid on street vendors. In a complaint filed against the government, she described being held for more than two days, without being allowed to contact the outside world for much of that time. (The Supreme Court has ruled that two days is generally the longest federal officials can hold Americans without charges.)
In response to questions from ProPublica, the Department of Homeland Security said agents do not racially profile or target Americans. “We don’t arrest US citizens for immigration enforcement,” wrote spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.
A top immigration official recently acknowledged agents do consider someone’s looks. “How do they look compared to, say, you?” Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino said to a white reporter in Chicago.
The White House told ProPublica that anyone who assaults federal immigration agents would be prosecuted. “Interfering with law enforcement and assaulting law enforcement is a crime and anyone, regardless of immigration status, will be held accountable,” said the Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson. “Officers act heroically to enforce the law, arrest criminal illegal aliens, and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism.”
A spokesperson for Kavanaugh did not return an emailed request for comment.
Tallying the number of Americans detained by immigration agents is inherently messy and incomplete. The government has long ignored recommendations for it to track such cases, even as the U.S. has a history of detaining and even deporting citizens, including during the Obama administration and Trump’s first term.
We compiled cases by sifting through both English- and Spanish-language social media, lawsuits, court records and local media reports. We did not include arrests of protesters by local police or the National Guard. Nor did we count cases in which arrests were made at a later date after a judicial process. That included cases of some people charged with serious crimes, like throwing rocks or tossing a flare to start a fire.
Experts say that Americans appear to be getting picked up more now as a result of the government doing something that it hasn’t for decades: large-scale immigration sweeps across the country, often in communities that do not want them.
In earlier administrations, deportation agents used intelligence to target specific individuals, said Scott Shuchart, a top immigration official in the Biden, Obama and first Trump administrations. “The new idea is to use those resources unintelligently” — with officers targeting communities or workplaces where undocumented immigrants may be.
When federal officers roll through communities in the way the Supreme Court permitted, the constitutional rights of both citizens and noncitizens are inevitably violated, argued David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. He recently analyzed how sweeps in Los Angeles have led to racial profiling. “If the government can grab someone because he’s a certain demographic group that’s correlated with some offense category, then they can do that in any context.”
Cody Wofsy, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, put it even more starkly. “Any one of us could be next.”
When Kavanaugh issued his opinion that immigration agents can consider race and other factors, the Supreme Court’s three liberal justices strongly dissented. They warned that citizens risked being “grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor.”

Leonardo Garcia Venegas appears to have been just such a case. He was working at a construction site in coastal Alabama when he saw masked immigration agents from Homeland Security Investigations hop a fence and run by a “No trespassing” sign. Garcia Venegas recalled that they moved toward the Latino workers, ignoring the white and Black workers.
Garcia Venegas began filming after his undocumented brother asked agents for a warrant. In response, the footage shows, agents yanked his brother to the ground, shoving his face into wet concrete. Garcia Venegas kept filming until officers grabbed him too and knocked his phone to the ground.
Other co-workers filmed what happened next, as immigration agents twisted the 25-year-old’s arms. They repeatedly tried to take him to the ground while he yelled, “I’m a citizen!”
Officers pulled out his REAL ID, which Alabama only issues to those legally in the U.S. But the agents dismissed it as fake. Officers held Garcia Venegas handcuffed for more than an hour. His brother was later deported.
Garcia Venegas was so shaken that he took two weeks off of work. Soon after he returned, he was working alone inside a nearly built house listening to music on his headphones when he sensed someone watching him. A masked immigration agent was standing in the bedroom doorway.
This time, agents didn’t tackle him. But they again dismissed his REAL ID. And then they held him to check his citizenship. Garcia Venegas says agents also held two other workers who had legal status.
DHS did not respond to ProPublica’s questions about Garcia Venegas’ detentions, or to a federal lawsuit he filed last month. The agency has previously defended the agents’ conduct, saying he “physically got in between agents and the subject” during the first incident. The footage does not show that, and Garcia Venegas was never charged with obstruction or any other crime.
Garcia Venegas’ lawyers at the nonprofit Institute for Justice hope others may join his suit. After all, the reverberations of the immigration sweeps are being felt widely. Garcia Venegas said he knows of 15 more raids on nearby construction sites, and the industry along his portion of the Gulf Coast is struggling for lack of workers.
Kavanaugh’s assurances hold little weight for Garcia Venegas. He’s a U.S. citizen of Mexican descent, who speaks little English and works in construction. Even with his REAL ID and Social Security card in his wallet, Garcia Venegas worries that immigration agents will keep harassing him.
“If they decide they want to detain you,” he said. “You’re not going to get out of it.”
Retes said that agents knew he was a citizen. “They didn’t care.” (Photos by Sarahbeth Maney/ProPublica)
George Retes was among the citizens arrested despite immigration agents appearing to know his legal status. He also disappeared into the system for days without being able to contact anyone on the outside.
The only clue Retes’ family had at first was a brief call he managed to make on his Apple Watch with his hands handcuffed behind his back. He quickly told his wife that “ICE” had arrested him during a massive raid and protest on the marijuana farm where he worked as a security guard.
Still, Retes’ family couldn’t find him. They called every law enforcement agency they could think of. No one gave them any answers.
Eventually, they spotted a TikTok video showing Retes driving to work and slowly trying to back up as he’s caught between agents and protestors. Through the tear gas and dust, his family recognized Retes’ car and the veteran decal on his window. The full video shows a man — Retes — splayed on the ground surrounded by agents.
Retes’ family went to the farm, where local TV reporters were interviewing families who couldn’t find their loved ones.
“They broke his window, they pepper sprayed him, they grabbed him, threw him on the floor,” his sister told a reporter between sobs. “We don’t know what to do. We’re just asking to let my brother go. He didn’t do anything wrong. He’s a veteran, disabled citizen. It says it on his car.”
Retes was held for three days without being given an opportunity to make a call. His family only learned where he had been after his release. His leg had been cut from the broken glass, Retes told ProPublica, and lingering pepper spray burned his hands.He tried to soothe them by filling sandwich bags with water.
Retes recalled that agents knew he was a citizen. “They didn’t care.” He said one DHS official laughed at him, saying he shouldn’t have come to work that day. “They still sent me away to jail.” He added that cases like his show Kavanaugh was “wrong completely.”
DHS did not answer our questions about Retes. It did respond on X after Retes wrote an op-ed last month in the San Francisco Chronicle. An agency post asserted he was arrested for assault after he “became violent and refused to comply with law enforcement.” Yet Retes had been released without any charges. Indeed, he says he was never told why he was arrested.
The Department of Justice has encouraged agents to arrest anyone interfering with immigration operations, twiceordering law enforcement to prioritize cases of those suspected of obstructing, interfering with or assaulting immigration officials.
But the government’s claims in those cases have often not been borne out.

Daniel Montenegro was filming a raid at a Van Nuys, California, Home Depot with other day-laborer advocates this summer when, he told ProPublica, he was tackled by several officers who injured his back.
Bovino, the Border Patrol chief who oversaw the LA raids and has since taken similar operations to cities like Sacramento and Chicago, tweeted out the names and photos of Montenegro and three others, accusing them of using homemade tire spikes to disable vehicles.
“I had no idea where that story came from,” Montenegro told ProPublica. “I didn’t find out until we were released. People were like, ‘We saw you on Twitter and the news and you guys are terrorists, you were planning to slash tires.’ I never saw those spike tire-popper things.”
Officials have not charged Montenegro or the others with any crimes. (Bovino did not respond to a request for comment, while DHS defended him in a statement to ProPublica: “Chief Bovino’s success in getting the worst of the worst out of the country speaks for itself.”)
The government’s cases are sometimes so muddied that it’s unclear why agents actually arrested a citizen.
Andrea Velez was charged with assaulting an officer after she was accidentally dropped off for work during a raid on street vendors in downtown Los Angeles. She said in a federal complaint that officers repeatedly assumed she did not speak English. Federal officers later requested access to her phone in an attempt to prove she was colluding with another citizen arrested that day, who was charged with assault. She was one of the Americans held for more than two days.
DHS did not respond to our questions about Velez, but it has previously accused her of assaulting an officer. A federal judge has dismissed the charges.
Other citizens also said officers accused them of crimes and suddenly questioned their citizenship — including a man arrested after filming Border Patrol agents break a truck window, and a pregnant woman who tried to stop officers from taking her boyfriend.
The prospects for any significant reckoning over agents’ conduct, even against citizens, are dim. The paths for suing federal agents are even more limited than they are for local police. And that’s if agents can even be identified. What’s more, the administration has gutted the office that investigates allegations of abuse by agents.
“The often-inadequate guardrails that we have for state and local government — even those guardrails are nonexistent when you’re talking about federal overreach,” said Joanna Schwartz, a professor at UCLA School of Law.
More than 50 members of Congress have also written to the administration, demanding details about Americans who’ve been detained. One is Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat. After trying to question Noem about detained citizens, federal agents grabbed Padilla, pulled him to the ground and handcuffed him. The department later defended the agents, saying they “acted appropriately.”

“ Today’s groundbreaking is another example of the special things happening in our state,” Gov. Tate Reeves said at the event on Wednesday.
The Georgia-based company already has a presence in Louisville, and this new $90-million flat-rolled aluminum processing facility will create 40 direct jobs.
Kloeckner Metals is the first company to join the Aluminum Dynamics Customer Park in Columbus, a venture of Steel Dynamics. Kloeckner will make automotive and other goods from metal manufactured next door at the Aluminum Dynamics factory.
Mark Millet, the co-founder and CEO of Steel Dynamics, celebrated the partnership between Steel Dynamics and Mississippi that dates back to 2014 when the company purchased a factory in Columbus. He emphasized the company’s continued commitment to Mississippi and thanked Reeves for the incentives the company received from the state. These included a $247-million package for the aluminum factory passed by the Legislature in 2022.

Agriculture was once the Golden Triangle’s primary industry. But local economic developers and leaders have successfully brought new manufacturing jobs to the area. Leroy Brooks, who represents District 5 on the Lowndes County Board of Supervisors, recalled growing up and smelling cotton just a few pastures away from where the new factory will break ground. 
Meryl Fisackerly, COO of the Golden Triangle Development LINK, the area’s economic development agency, said the factory, “Means jobs, opportunity and long-term commitment to our people and our region’s future.” Fisackerly is overseeing day-to-day operations of LINK after the sudden departure of its longtime CEO Joe Max Higgins in August.

While speakers mainly focused on the partnership between local and state governments and industry, the event also highlighted the national push for more American manufacturing. This included a logo on the event backdrop that read, “We are building North America.”
“ This investment by (Aluminum Dynamics) brings aluminum production back to North America at a critical moment in time. And Kloeckner is excited to become a strategic supply chain partner that helps deliver American-made aluminum,” said John Ganem, CEO of Americas Kloeckner Metals. 
Talking with the press after the event, Reeves emphasized that Mississippi’s investment in manufacturing has positioned it well for the current business climate.

(Getty Images)Here’s what’s encouraging as we make our way through the month of October, which is designated as Domestic Violence Awareness Month: two pieces have been published in the Charleston Gazette-Mail this month that bring out into the bright light of day not only the devastation brought about by domestic violence but also ways in which we might engage in the fight against domestic violence, findings ways to help the countless victims.
Ashley Perham’s piece, “No one alone: Kanawha County advocates provide support for domestic violence victims,” focused on Kanawha County victim advocates who provide support for domestic violence victims. Perham reported that the advocates had served 2,666 clients. Every Kanawha County crime that has a victim is worked by an advocate. 
So far this year in Kanawha County, there have been more than 10,000 misdemeanors and 1,300 felonies related to domestic violence. However, not all of these cases have victims. According to one advocate, national statistics show around a quarter of all women are victims of domestic violence at some point in their adult life. Read that sentence again. Perham’s piece also addressed the fact that not all victims of domestic violence are women.
The second piece, a commentary re-published from InsideSources, by Jerry Tello, co-founder of the National Compadres Network, titled “Domestic violence isn’t just a women’s issue,” stated that “silence and inaction of men allows cycles of generational trauma and abuse to persist.” Tello continues, “Domestic violence is deeply intertwined with larger systems of inequality. Our promise as men needs to be about speaking up in spaces where silence allows abuse to thrive . . . Fathers, brothers and sons who stand alongside women against abuse send a clear message: survival, safety and healing are collective responsibilities.”
Perham’s article spoke to victims of domestic violence failing to recognize the severity of their situation. And that’s when a stark reality came to me that, without any conscious effort on my part, each of the stories in my new work, “The Harboring & other stories,” was conceptualized and fictionalized from women I had known throughout my life who had, admittedly or not, been victims of domestic violence. It was a most chilling moment and one that came on the heels of reader feedback that reinforced that very real moment. Still, in these women’s indisputable recognition of the truth, each lived their life every day for years believing that things would change, “one day,” that the abuse would stop. Each knew it of the others as well and yet they served their communities, their families and their churches with dignity and grace, hiding their emotional and physical and spiritual pain behind a very intentional mask. In the end, it seemed, their silence was as unbearable as the abuse inflicted on them.
Reporting domestic violence statistics is necessary in terms of assessing the needs of the victims and providing the vital financial support needed to help victims of domestic violence to heal and to rebuild their lives. But what is equally vital is finding ways to break the stigma and the silence that clothe every single victim of domestic violence. That is when the walls truly begin to crumble and the path to healing begins. That is when change begins. That is when the tides turn.
I’m not idealistic to the point where I think, to any degree, that the road to recovery is ever a smooth one, but I am confident that it can be managed with support from the state and federal levels and from each and every single one of us finding a way to contribute to helping victims of domestic violence, because to simply read of the atrocities, shake our heads in disbelief, and perhaps shed a few tears will do very little to change these rising numbers. Domestic violence is about control. Find a way to bring awareness. Reading these two impactful articles will set you on the right path.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Last year marked the first time no community in Rhode Island was affordable to a household earning under $100,000 a year. And now this year is the first time the median renter cannot afford an average two-bedroom apartment anywhere in the state.
That’s one of the many bleak takeaways of the latest housing factbook released Friday by HousingWorks RI, the housing policy research group based at Roger Williams University. This year’s report determined that the lowest income to affordably rent the average-priced two-bedroom apartment, including utilities, is $60,320.
The average renter in Rhode Island earned an annual income of $48,434 in 2024, according to the 84-page report.
Simply put, “Rhode Islanders continued to face a challenging housing market,” the factbook says.
Among the many major factors leading to the smallest state’s affordability crisis: There just aren’t enough places for people to live. 
A healthy rental market typically has a vacancy rate of 5 to 8%, according to the factbook. Data from the Federal Reserve notes a statewide rental vacancy rate of 2.6% in 2024. 
It’s somewhat better in the Providence metropolitan area, which had a 3.2% rental vacancy rate, according to the factbook.
“We have not hit that number in at least six plus years,” Brenda Clement, executive director for HousingWorks RI, said in an interview Thursday.
State officials have encouraged new home construction over the past couple of years by adopting new laws that have eased zoning restrictions, streamlined permitting, and allowed accessory dwelling units. But Clement said it’s ultimately up to local leaders to get on board.
“What you build, where you build, and how you build are all at the local level,” she said.
But not every town wants to have dense, multifamily developments.
The town of Johnston is battling in court to stop a proposed 252-unit apartment complex after Mayor Joseph Polisena Jr., a Democrat, tried to use eminent domain to seize the site for a public safety complex. The Westerly Planning Board nixed a plan to construct 2,300 homes at Winnapaug Country Club — a decision recently upheld by a Superior Court judge.
Many leaders who oppose large projects instead favor single family homes, which the HousingWorks report contends furthers the “continuation of inefficient land use in Rhode Island.”
“While large homes on expansive lots may seem to generate the most revenue for a municipality’s tax base, single family homes in Rhode Island are less valuable, per acre of land,” the report states. 
That focus on single family homes has made it so most towns continue to fail meeting the state’s 10% affordable housing target set in the 1991 Low and Moderate Income Housing law. Eight municipalities — Burrillville, Central Falls, East Providence, Newport, Pawtucket, Providence, West Warwick, and Woonsocket — met the goal for 2025. It’s double what HousingWorks reported last year, but that’s only because the legislature updated the definition of what constitutes an affordable home.
The law passed in 2024 added any homes where Section 8 federal housing vouchers were used, as well as mobile homes, to the group of properties that qualify as legally “affordable.”










What you build, where you build, and how you build are all at the local level.


– Brenda Clement, executive director for HousingWorks RI


To get towns on board, Clement suggests the state withhold any extra infrastructure funding unless they commit to more construction. It’s a similar plan House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi floated when unveiling the chamber’s 2025 housing package last February.
Clement suggests towns take a look to the past to figure out its future. A prime example, she said, are former mill villages which consisted of a job center surrounded by homes for varying economic classes along a robust transit line.
“Reconnecting all of that together is what can hopefully come about,” she said.
But a lot of uncertainty remains whether the state will have the federal funding necessary to get more homes built. Still, Clement remains optimistic that local leaders will work to get new affordable homes open in the coming years.
“We just have to keep on pushing where we can push,” she said. “The end result is worth it — nothing works right in your life if you don’t have a decent place to get up from every day and to go back to every night.”

Sign up for their newsletter here.
As plans to build huge data centers multiply across the United States, some Pennsylvania communities are pushing back.
Responding to public opposition, commissioners in Hampden Township, near Harrisburg, voted in September against allowing data centers in office park zones.
In the borough of Blakely, northeast of Scranton, a developer dropped plans for a data center that same month after local protests.
And in Anthony Township in central Pennsylvania, a citizens group is urging municipal leaders to reject an application by Talen Energy, a power-generating company, to rezone 1,300 acres near one of its power plants to an industrial classification that could be used for a data center.
“To pick up that much land and build any kind of industry would be very detrimental to the whole rural atmosphere,” said Sam Burleigh, a co-founder of the group, Concerned Citizens of Montour County.
Taryne Williams, a spokesperson for Talen Energy, said a change to industrial zoning would align with the classification of other Talen-owned land in the area.
“We are still assessing the viability of potential projects, and the rezoning request will help support any possible future development opportunity near the plant, which could include data centers,” Williams said.
Data centers power the internet, but what’s driving the new increase in proposals around the country—many of them supersized—is artificial intelligence. Boosters say these complexes are big taxpayers and bring jobs. Critics often cite the intense buildout in Northern Virginia as an illustration of the effect they can have on communities, from constant low-frequency noise to spiking electric bills and major water usage.
Data-center developers warned the Virginia utility Dominion Energy at the end of last year that their upcoming projects would need 40 gigawatts of electricity—the energy equivalent of increasing Virginia’s households nearly fourfold.
Dominion plans to respond by building more natural gas power plants, which could raise utility bills for households and businesses while increasing carbon emissions.
Many data centers also have on-site diesel generators that are meant for backup power but are being run more frequently, worsening air quality and prompting noise complaints from residents.
“We’ve seen the devastating impact of these hyper-scale data centers in other states. We applaud Hampden Township for standing up against this water and energy guzzling industry,” said Virginia Marcille-Kerslake, eastern Pennsylvania organizer for the nonprofit Food & Water Watch, which took credit for mobilizing public opposition to the proposed zoning change there.
Some 300 Hampden residents signed a petition opposing the zoning change. The town’s seven commissioners voted unanimously against it.
“When we caught wind that Hampden was doing this, we created a flyer with a QR code to raise awareness,” Marcille-Kerslake said. “We started knocking on doors, and nobody knew about it but as word started to spread, the comments people made were so well-informed.”
Marcille-Kerslake urged municipalities to restrict data centers to industrial zones and away from homes, schools and hospitals. Food & Water Watch recommends imposing conditions on data centers rather than banning them altogether.
“You have to put it somewhere, so you have to have a very strong ordinance to keep the data center in the industrial district,” she said.
Twenty-one data centers are now planned in Pennsylvania, according to padatacenterproposals.com, a database that tracks the projects. Many are in the northeastern part of the state.
Among the projects moving forward is one planned by Amazon Web Services in Salem Township, near Wilkes-Barre. The project, one of two Amazon data centers that represent a total investment of $20 billion by the tech giant in Pennsylvania, is expected to use about as much electricity as 750,000 homes.
Not far from there, in Hazle Township, NorthPoint Development is planning a 15-building data center on some 1,280 acres.
And in neighboring Delaware, recently unveiled plans to build a six-million-square-foot data center in the northern part of the state have prompted a bill in New Castle County calling on the developer to ensure that the electric grid will have sufficient capacity to supply the 1,200 megawatts that the giant center would need. Delaware is part of the regional grid run by PJM Interconnection, which also includes Pennsylvania and Virginia, and it’s already under pressure from data-center growth.
The latest version of the New Castle County bill also calls for the developer to plan for the center’s decommissioning so taxpayers are not left with the cost of closing it down.
Developer Starwood Digital Ventures said about 40 percent of the site would be open space, about twice the share required by the county, and around double that typically occupied by data centers around the country.
The company plans to meet the plant’s huge energy needs by connecting to an existing 500-kilovolt power line that is “one of the largest capacity lines that is employed on the U.S. grid,” said Starwood’s CEO, Anthony Balastrieri. “Having access to that infrastructure that already exists is very beneficial.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ashburn-Virginia-1024x596.jpeg,,,2025-10-17 06:01:16.143995

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Democratic candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives in Colorado have raised a combined total of nearly $20 million so far in 2025 as they look to flip one or more Republican-controlled seats in the 2026 midterms.
The combined fundraising haul is nearly triple the size of the total raised by Colorado’s four incumbent GOP members of Congress, each of whom has already drawn at least one well-funded challenger as Democrats look to win back control of the House next year.
By contrast, the state’s four Democratic House incumbents have so far drawn only token opposition from candidates who have yet to report any fundraising activity to the Federal Election Commission.
To date, Democratic donors have showered the most campaign cash on the Colorado congressional race that analysts say they are the least likely to win: in the 4th Congressional District, where U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert won a 12-percentage-point victory over Democrat Trisha Calvarese in 2024. The district’s nine-point GOP lean, according to the Cook Political Report’s Partisan Voting Index, makes it the most heavily Republican district in Colorado.

Eileen Laubacher, a retired Navy rear admiral and former National Security Council official, has raised more than $4.4 million since announcing her 4th District candidacy in May, more than triple Boebert’s haul over the same period. Repeating a pattern set by previous challengers to Boebert, a controversial far-right figure with a national profile, the vast majority of Laubacher’s campaign receipts have come from out-of-state donors and small-dollar contributions through digital fundraising sites like ActBlue, according to FEC disclosures. The 4th District stretches across most of the state’s rural Eastern Plains region, along with a handful of more suburban areas in Douglas, Weld and Larimer counties.
“I’ve listened to veterans driving hours for care they’ve earned, hospitals struggling to keep their doors open, and families hit by rising costs. Lauren Boebert ignores them,” Laubacher said in a statement on her fundraising haul. “She won’t show up, won’t answer their questions, and won’t lift a finger in Congress to help. I will. I’ll show up, I’ll listen, and I’ll fight for real solutions for the people of this district.”
Calvarese has also raised more than $640,000 in 2025 as she seeks a rematch with Boebert, and a third Democratic hopeful, John Padora, has reported $350,000 in receipts, bringing the Democrats’ combined 4th District haul to well over $5 million.
That’s substantially more money than has been raised so far by the combined Democratic field in the tossup 8th District, where incumbent GOP Rep. Gabe Evans eked out a victory by fewer than 2,500 votes last year. The district includes suburban areas in north metro Denver along with more rural areas in Weld County.
State Rep. Manny Rutinel of Commerce City continues to maintain a large fundraising lead over a crowded field of Democratic primary hopefuls in the 8th District. Since launching his campaign in January, he’s raised over $2 million, and he reported just over $1 million in cash on hand as of Sept. 30.
In a press release, Rutinel boasted of a third-quarter fundraising total that exceeded Evans’ haul, though the Fort Lupton Republican reported far more cash on hand, amassing over $1.9 million as he waits for a Democratic challenger to emerge from the June 30 primary.
“We’re building the strongest campaign to defeat Gabe Evans, and that starts with raising the resources to win,” Rutinel said. “I’m proud that our campaign is backed by thousands of teachers, firefighters, ranchers, nurses, small business owners, and so many more that have chipped in a few dollars at a time.”
Another Democratic candidate in the 8th District, state Rep. Shannon Bird of Westminster, trails Rutinel with about $560,000 in cash on hand, having raised about $833,000 since launching her campaign in May. She touted a high percentage of contributions coming from Colorado donors in a press release Thursday.
“I’m grateful that Coloradans are uniting behind our campaign to fire Gabe Evans,” Bird said. “Together, we’ll flip this seat and lower costs, expand healthcare, and protect our Colorado way of life.”
After former 8th District Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo dropped her bid to win back her seat last month, three other Democrats remain in the primary race. As of Sept. 30, Evan Munsing, a Marine veteran and private equity consultant, has raised $260,603; Colorado State Treasurer Dave Young has raised $164,392; and Amie Baca-Oehlert, former president of the Colorado Education Association, has raised $129,823.
Republicans favored in 3rd, 5th districts
Two other first-term Republican incumbents — Rep. Jeff Hurd of Grand Junction in the 3rd District, and Rep Jeff Crank of Colorado Springs in the 5th District — are considered favorites to win reelection, but could be in jeopardy if there’s a wave election for Democrats. As of this month, both races are rated as likely Republican by the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.
Hurd’s lone Democratic challenger, financial executive Alex Kelloff, trails far behind the incumbent in fundraising so far in 2025, having collected about $459,000 in receipts while loaning his campaign another $220,000. Hurd, who has raised over $1.9 million, also faces a conservative primary challenger in Hope Scheppelman, a former state GOP vice chair, who has raised about $169,000 since her June campaign launch. The 3rd District encompasses most of Colorado’s Western Slope, along with the San Luis Valley and the greater Pueblo area.
Jessica Killin, an Army veteran and political operative, leads three other candidates for the Democratic nomination the 5th District. Her third-quarter fundraising total of over $1 million was more than double Crank’s reported haul, which Killin said in a statement showed an appetite within the district, which is centered on Colorado Springs, for “new leadership that is responsive to the needs of this community.”
“(Crank) lost Space Command, added $4 trillion to the national debt, and continues to put partisanship over the people of the Pikes Peak region,” Killin said. “I’m so grateful for this support that will help us flip Colorado’s 5th district together and restore competence, courage, and character to Washington.”

(Mike Sweeney, Special to Colorado Newsline)Pueblo voters next month will decide whether the city government should return to a city council-city manager form of leadership after the city has operated under a strong mayor since voters approved the switch in 2017.


Election 2025
Coloradans are voting on two statewide ballot measures and a variety of local issues in the off-year election. Click here for more of Newsline’s coverage.


Ballot Question 2C, which Pueblo City Council referred to the ballot, would amend the city charter to establish a city manager and eliminate the positions of mayor, deputy mayor and chief of staff. 
City Council would select the city manager, and the council would have power over appointments to local boards and commissions as well as the city clerk and municipal court judges. The mayor has control over those positions in the government’s current form. 
Pueblo Mayor Heather Graham in August vetoed the ordinance referring the question to the ballot, but City Council overrode her veto on a 6-1 vote. Graham said personal issues between her and the council prompted the measure and said it is members’ attempt to remove her from office. She is only the second mayor Pueblo has had since the city changed government forms, after she defeated former Mayor Nick Gradisar, who started in 2019. 
Strong-mayor cities in Colorado, including Denver and Colorado Springs, are rare. A mayor is an elected official who has a more political role in running the city, while a city manager is selected by the city council and is a more professional role that runs the city under the direction of the council.

Those in support of the measure say Pueblo needs a professional, not a politician, leading the city, and that a city manager executes the vision City Council sets for the city. 
Those against the measure say Pueblo has benefited from having a mayor as “a leader directly chosen by the people and accountable to the entire community.” 
The website behind the effort to keep a mayor says the mayor is paid $150,000 annually, has no paid leave and no severance, while the city manager in 2018 was paid $182,947, received paid leave, benefits and bonuses, and would get severance if terminated.
The Southern Colorado Labor Council supports a no vote on the measure. 
If the measure passes, it will take effect immediately and City Council would appoint an interim city manager.  
County clerks began mailing out ballots last week. Election Day is Nov. 4.

(Photo courtesy of Arkansas Game and Fish Commission)When a black bear attacked a man in Franklin County on Sept. 3, it seemed like a one-off tragedy. But a second fatal attack in Newton County, just four weeks later and about 80 miles west, has raised questions about whether the fatal attacks — the first in more than a century — are more than a coincidence. 
Both attacks involved young, male black bears, who assaulted the victims apparently unprovoked. Testing revealed the bear involved in the first attack was malnourished and “not functioning normally,” according to the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission. Spokesperson Keith Stevens said the AGFC is still waiting on test results for the bear involved in the second attack, but initial findings indicate the bear was “extremely healthy” with a belly full of natural foods.
AGFC is still searching for answers, having found no evidence of diseases like rabies or distemper that could explain the aggressive behavior. But leading conservation biologists consulted for this article say the attacks are likely related to widespread human changes that have created ecological disruption. 
Neil Carter, an associate professor at University of Michigan, studies the relationship between wildlife, people and the environment. Carter said that, in the exceedingly rare case a black bear attacks a human, multiple factors are usually at play, such as the bear’s health and psychology, social interactions with other animals, changes to its environment and global climate shifts. 
Because bears are “laser-focused” on finding food, small shifts in their environment that are related to large-scale climate disruptions — like human-induced climate change — can have a measurable effect on their behavior, Carter said. He explained that climate change creates longer-term stressors that alter a bear’s access to food and water.
“Climate change is a contributing force here, but whether or not that’s what drove one or two bears to do this, it’s virtually impossible to make that connection,” Carter said. “I would probably say instead that it’s probably not just one thing, it’s probably a series of things happening simultaneously.” 
For example, La Niña climate oscillations are associated with drier years and less mast production — the fruit and nut trees that bears gorge on in the fall before hibernation — leading to increased human-bear conflicts. Carter said this resource scarcity can force bears to drastically expand their home ranges and wander into new, human-dominated areas.  
“Our research is pointing to the idea that because climate change is prevalent and pervasive, that it’s not unreasonable to consider that small changes in where and how much food is available will have ramifications on where animals like bears are and how they interact … wherever that food goes, or doesn’t go, pushes them around quite a bit,” he said.
Arkansas becomes part of ‘Dixie Alley’ as more frequent tornadic activity shifts east and south

Carter’s concerns about climate shifts are supported by current meteorological forecasts. A climate shift outlook released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in September indicated a high probability of La Niña conditions persisting through the fall. These conditions increase the chances of below-average precipitation across the Southern U.S., and align with the ongoing drought affecting much of the Ozark region.  
Emily Puckett is an associate professor at the University of Memphis who studies bear migration patterns. She previously worked on the Missouri Black Bear Project, tracking the growing population of black bears coming into Missouri from Arkansas. Puckett emphasized that a bad season for mast crops could lead to this kind of unusual bear aggression, and that current data on mast production could provide additional insight into the attacks.
AGFC does not believe a lack of available natural food sources stemming from recent droughts is related to the attacks. 
“There’s no indication of that,” Stephens said in an email. “Both bears had natural foods in their stomach, but only the Franklin County bear was malnourished.”  
Stephens said there are “anecdotal observations indicating an average mast crop,” but AGFC could not immediately provide requested mast crop data to support this observation.  
Human encroachment on bear territory 
Human activities, such as development, new road construction and recreational land use, can also alter bear habitats and increase the likelihood of encounters with people. While human encroachment on wild areas drives away most other animals, bears stay behind, and are often rewarded for it with human scraps.  
“A lot of animals can’t do that, but bears can,” Carter said. “So I think the answer is an unsatisfying ‘probably,’ it’s entirely possible these things are happening.”
Puckett noted how bear population recovery efforts have corresponded with accelerated human development over the past few decades. 
“This has been a long-term effect of a decrease in human persecution [of black bears] that kind of stopped in the ‘60s and ‘70s, and we’ve seen these localized recoveries of populations not just of bears but of other mesocarnivores as well,” she said. “But at the same time, human development is coming into their habitat.” 
A path forward 
Stephens said AGFC is continuing to investigate the attacks. Both bears have been euthanized, although AGFC is still awaiting DNA results to confirm the second bear shot was the one that perpetrated the attack. Sam’s Throne Campground, where the second attack occurred, will remain closed until the match is confirmed, Newton County Sheriff Glenn Wheeler previously stated. 
“We are committed to educating the public on respecting wild animals and viewing them from a safe distance,” Stephens said. “We are investigating both attacks in an attempt to identify what may have provoked the animals, but we may never know the answers to these questions.” 
Carter emphasized it was impossible to determine the exact causes of the attacks without extensive research, which could take years. He suggested AGFC commission a research program to investigate whether shifts are being driven by factors like human development and climate change. 
Puckett suggested people stay up to date with knowledge of how to effectively prevent bear attacks. 
“Bears and humans do utilize very similar landscapes when they have the choice,” she said. “And so that’s why we have to be so cognizant of how our choices can create this situation for bears to get into conflict and do our part to minimize that.”

By combining capital, ideological goals, local legitimacy and policy levers, CSF and its allies are constructing a strategic message enabling market-based education reform to become the default solution for “failing public schools.”
In 2024, the CSF launched with $50 million in philanthropic backing. It is using these funds to “partner with communities” to open “outstanding new schools.”
After backing nine new charter schools and two microschools, it now plans to fund 25 more and implement a two-year fellowship program to train future charter school founders.
On its surface, the initiative looks like another investment in education innovation. But behind its messaging is a decades-long campaign by powerful business and political elites to weaken traditional public schools and replace them with a mix of charter schools, microschools, and, eventually, private school vouchers.
Who’s behind the fund
The fund’s leadership and board members tell the story. Founding board chair Jill Anschutz, director with the Anschutz Foundation, brings both money and  commitment to the project. The Anschutz family, led by billionaire Philip Anschutz, the richest man in Colorado, has been one of the most influential conservative philanthropic forces in the country, underwriting everything from religious causes to free-market education reforms. Jill Anschutz serves on the Charter Schools Institute board, a state agency that authorized 45 charter schools, sometimes in school districts whose elected boards objected to their authorization. 
Joining Anschutz on the fund’s board is Darryl Cobb, president of the Charter School Growth Fund. For nearly two decades, CSGF has been a major player in using over $600 million in philanthropic assets to scale charter school networks across the country, including DSST, Rocky Mountain Prep, James Irwin, and Third Future schools in Colorado. Its mission is to fund schools in “underserved communities with limited access to high quality schools.”

Also on the board is Hanna Skandera, CEO of the Daniels Fund. The conservative-leaning Daniels Fund is explicitly committed to expanding “competition and school choice through high-performing charter schools and private schools, tuition assistance/portable voucher programs, and other innovative market-driven education initiatives.”
In 2023, the Daniels Fund set a goal of adding 100,000 new charter, private, or religious seats in four states including Colorado by 2030. Luke Ragland is the Daniels Fund’s senior vice president of grants, and also a board member with Ready Colorado, one of the organizations that supported a Colorado voucher amendment last year. 
The fourth CSF board member, Rosemary Rodriguez, is a former Denver City Council member and former Denver Public Schools board member during the heyday of the pro-charter reform era. She serves on boards of the Gates Foundation, the Colorado League of Charter Schools, and Educate Denver. 
Rodriguez’s involvement as co-leader of Educate Denver connects the CSF within Denver politics and expands the broader network’s goals. Formed in 2022 and backed by business elites like oil executive Bruce Benson, Educate Denver has pushed the narrative that DPS students are “failing,” framing innovation and charter growth as the only path forward, despite lacking any definitive evidence that charters outperform traditional schools overall. For more than a decade, Benson and Anschutz have poured substantial funds into pro-charter DPS school board candidates, contributing another $60,000 in the current election cycle.
‘Failing schools’ narrative ignores inequality
Lydia Hoffman, the CSF’s CEO, outlined the CSF playbook in a recent presentation at the New Schools Summit in March 2025, organized by the New Schools Venture Fund, a multi-million-dollar organization investing in charter schools for nearly three decades. In the publication Charter Folk, Hoffman insisted new schools were necessary because Colorado has “30-point proficiency gaps between our low-income students and their peers.”
Hoffman’s argument ignores decades of research showing that poverty, not school design, is the central driver of achievement gaps. Instead of addressing inequities in housing, health care and funding, CSF highlights test-score disparities. 
This “failure” rhetoric aligns perfectly with the “education desert” legislation advanced last spring by Colorado’s Senate President James Coleman, a leading member of Educate Denver. Coleman considered proposing legislation to allow the Charter School Institute to open new charter schools in school districts labeled as “education deserts,” justifying this plan by asserting the districts lacked “high quality” schools. Coleman delayed introducing the legislation to secure funding from advocacy groups. Together, these political and philanthropic efforts by CSF and groups like Educate Denver create the impression of a “crisis” in Colorado and the justification for privatized solutions.
Vouchers, the next frontier
The danger of this multi-million-dollar game plan is clear. While framed as “opportunity,” the strategy effectively drains resources and legitimacy from public schools. By branding existing schools as broken, these groups make it easier to argue for charters and microschools today, and vouchers for private schools tomorrow. The Daniels Fund’s explicit voucher ambitions are a glimpse of what lies ahead: Once enough parents buy into the idea that public schools cannot be fixed, the political stage will be set for taxpayer-funded private school access.
Tying these efforts to the national picture makes the trajectory even more concerning. The Trump administration passed a federal voucher bill in July and has framed public education as a monopoly in need of disruption. This federal push for vouchers to use as tax credits for private or religious schools is part of a broader national agenda championed by pro-privatization groups. 
What’s at stake for Colorado
The historical influence of figures like Philip Anschutz, Bruce Benson and the Daniels Fund reveals this as a long game, not a sudden shift. For decades, billionaires and corporate investors have promoted policies and funded organizations that weaken public school systems while elevating market-based alternatives. The Colorado Schools Fund is simply the latest, well-financed group furthering that agenda.
For Colorado families, the stakes could not be higher. At risk is not just the funding of local schools but the very idea of education as a public good. The push to replace public education with a patchwork of privately run models may be sold as innovation, but its long-term effects could be devastating, creating steeper inequities, splintering communities and eroding the democratic foundation of public schooling.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Richmond region residents will soon be able to throw out their trash in bins that were once garbage themselves. Several Central Virginia localities have invested in 3,000 new trash carts partially made with a plastic-alternative material created by a waste diversion company.
The Israel-based company UBQ ships European garbage to their production site in the Netherlands, where items destined for the landfill — such as organic matter, plastic, and other waste besides metal and glass — are ground down. The shredded waste is then made into pellets that are shipped to other companies that use them to make items like the garbage carts, flower pots, and other plastic goods. While no American trash is used to make the UBQ materials, local leaders are eager to invest in programs that help reduce waste and carbon emissions.
“Here in Central Virginia, we generate and discard about 1.2 million tons of waste every year. Statewide Virginia manages more than 20 million tons annually… However, much of what isn’t recycled ends up in landfills, and that’s exactly why bringing UBQ’s technology to the United States and to Virginia is so important,” said Kim Hynes, Executive Director of the Central Virginia Waste Management Authority.
The carts are manufactured by Cascade Engineering in Michigan. The carts purchased by the city, county, and surrounding municipalities of Hopewell, Ashland, and Colonial Heights, total about a $100,000 investment. They will be given out to new homes being built or to homes that need a replacement cart.
UBQ estimates a 7.5% carbon emission reduction from making the carts with their product rather than non-recycled materials. The carbon reduction estimate does not take into account the climate impacts of transportation, production, compounding, and other processes in making the materials. The carts purchased by Virginia agencies are made of an estimated 5% of UBQ materials and some other recycled plastics. 
“Today’s announcement marks more than just the launch of new trash carts. It marks a new way of thinking about waste, turning what we once discarded into something useful,” said Laura Thomas, Director of the Richmond Office of Sustainability.

The national birth rate for females 15-19 years old was 13.1 per 1,000 females and Ohio’s teen birth rate is 14.6 per 1,000 females in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

More than half (61%) of Ohio’s chlamydia cases in 2023 were people between the ages of 15-24, according to the Ohio Department of Health. Ohio’s syphilis rate (16.3 per 100,000) was higher than the national average (15.8 per 100,000) in 2023, according to the CDC. 
“What we’ve seen is states that have no sex ed or poor sex ed policies, they typically fare worse on health indicators such as (sexually transmitted infections) rates, teen birth rates, having lower contraceptive knowledge, and other existing health disparities,” said Nawal Umar, senior policy analyst for Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS). 
“These states are also putting their young people at higher risk for sexual violence victimization and having poor mental health outcomes because sex education provides really critical instruction, consent and communication and healthy relationships and so much more,” Umar said.
Ohio’s curriculum stresses abstinence as a general policy and requires some instruction about sexually transmitted infections, according to the Ohio Revised Code. 
Schools are required to “emphasize adoption as an option to unintended pregnancies” and “teach the potential physical, psychological, emotional, and social side effects” of sex outside of marriage, according to Ohio’s law. 
Because Ohio lacks comprehensive sex education, it’s ultimately up to each school district on how they decide to teach it. 
“When there’s not a sex education policy in place at the state level, one of the major consequences of that is that teens across the state can have very diverse experiences when it comes to the kind of instruction they’re receiving about their bodies because there’s a lack of uniform policy,” Umar said. 
The Ohio Department of Education and Workforce is required to conduct an annual audit to ensure school districts are in compliance with the state’s law. 
Every district completed the 2023-24 audit and all but three school districts were found to be overall compliant. Jefferson Township Local School District (Montgomery County), Ridgewood Local School District (Coshocton County), and Washington Local Schools (Lucas County) were non-compliant. 
In explaining why it didn’t meet the standards, Ridgewood told the state “many family structures exist today, and all can provide children with a loving and supportive environment.”
“We have school staff and students who come from single-parent households, same-sex couples, and traditional married couple families alike,” the district said. “This highlights the importance of recognizing and respecting all family types. Furthermore, sex education should never be used to shame students for their family background.”
Jefferson Township’s district said it only have 255 students and was unable to find someone to teach sex ed, according to ODEW’s audit. 
“We do not teach children that if they were born out of wedlock there are harmful consequences for society,” Washington Local Schools wrote in their explanation. “All children have opportunities and are valued by our school district.”
Ohio is the only state without its own state health education content standards. Ohio lawmakers decide curriculum requirements, so the State Board of Education can not require health education standards. 
“It’s maddening that the State of Ohio has refused to implement this after decades of experts, educators, even religious communities, asking for this curriculum to be delivered in public schools because, unfortunately, some students don’t have families who are able to provide them with this information,” said Abortion Forward Executive Director Kellie Copeland. 
Comprehensive sex ed is medically accurate, age-appropriate information that teaches about sexual health, healthy relationships, and consent, said Jenna Wojdacz, Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio’s senior director of strategy and community engagement.
“Access to accurate sexual health information should not be political,” Wojdacz said. “It’s certainly what our young Ohio students need.”
The Ohio Center for Sex Education is the education arm of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio that teaches comprehensive sex education in schools and community organizations. 
The center currently teaches in six school districts — Cleveland Metropolitan School District (Cuyahoga County), Akron Public Schools (Summit County), Lakewood City Schools (Cuyahoga County), Berea Schools (Cuyahoga County), Shaker Heights Schools (Cuyahoga County), and Columbus City Schools (Franklin County). 
A 2021 report from the Journal of Adolescent Health reviewed three decades of research and determined there is strong support for comprehensive sex education.  
“When we don’t have comprehensive sex education, we know that learners are getting misinformation that is basically values laden by somebody else’s propaganda agenda,” Wojdacz said. 
Benefits of teaching comprehensive sex ed include reduced teenage birth rates, reduced STI rates, increased contraceptive usage, and delayed sexual activity, according to Umar. 
Students who received comprehensive sex education were less likely to have a teen pregnancy than those who received either no sex ed or abstinence-only programs, according to a 2008 report in the Journal of Adolescent Health. 
Advocates spoke out against having abstinence-only as a general policy. 
“It’s ineffective,” Umar said. “It also tends to be pretty heteronormative.” 
“A lot of the abstinence-only curriculum teaches this purity idea that if something sexually happens to you, then you’re not pure,” Copeland said. “That is so damaging to the psyche of people who have either become sexually active because they wanted to or because they didn’t want to.”
Ultimately, Copeland said, teaching abstinence-only as a general policy does not work. 
“It leaves (students) without vital information for when they do become sexually active later in their lives,” she said. “It’s really important for people to understand how their bodies work, how pregnancy works, and how sexually transmitted infections work.”
Receiving comprehensive sex education does not encourage students to engage in sexual activity, Wojdacz said. 
“In no way does our curriculum promote giving it a try or encouraging people to engage in any activities,” she said. “There’s no prescriptive aspect to comprehensive sex ed. … It’s reductive to suggest that accurate information is going to suddenly trigger a bunch of destructive behavior in people or a bunch of ill-advised behavior.”
Ohio is one of 13 states that received an “F” on SIECUS’s state profiles on sex education policy. Washington, Oregon, California, Illinois, New Jersey and Rhode Island all received an “A.”
Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have laws requiring sex education, according to SIECUS.
Umar urges Ohio lawmakers to push for better sex ed policies.
“There’s so many benefits that could be achieved by improving sex education,” she said.

Mary Kae Marinac, of Andover, Massachusetts, once heard some advice at an autism conference that stuck with her.
“I heard that parents need to find their child’s special skills and use those as a hook to get into the neurotypical world,” she said. “And so I use that as a mantra.”
Marinac’s twin sons, Will and Jeff Quirnbach, 31, have profound autism, and when they were young she set out to help them find that special skill. As a family, they’d spend every Saturday trying something new. Many activities failed to stick. One week, when the twins were 7, they tried visiting a family farm in Peterborough, New Hampshire.
“And it was another unmitigated disaster,” she said, adding that the smells and textures there triggered sensory issues.
Marinac said it took 14 years to get both sons to learn to use the toilet, and this became an issue at the farm.

“We had three toileting accidents in 90 minutes to the point we had no more clean clothes in the car,” she said. “We just figured, OK, this is it. So we packed the car and drove home.”
As they left, they saw the entrance to Miller State Park in Peterborough and signs for restrooms, so they pulled in.
“And right beside it was a 1.4-mile hiking trail,” Marinac said. “And we said, ‘Well, OK, why not?”
As the boys climbed, Marinac was amazed.
“Other than Will needing a little bit of encouragement in the middle, they charge up the hill and they run up the fire tower, completely mesmerized by the view of Boston skyscrapers to the south and all the panoply of the White Mountains,” she said. “And then, for the first time, in like forever, they slept. And the next day, their teachers asked me what new med I gave them. They paid attention. They participated.”
From there, the family became avid hikers. Once they summited all of the notoriously challenging Appalachian Mountain Club’s list of 48 New Hampshire 4,000-footers (which took them roughly 11 years), they moved onto the 19 other 4,000-footers in New England. Once they reach the peak of Vose Spur near Bartlett — which they plan to attempt on Sunday — they’ll have completed 100 of New England’s highest mountains.
She said, “discovering their unique capabilities in hiking is a joy of my entire life.”
But they haven’t only hiked alone as a family. Roughly 11 years ago, Marinac and her husband, Paul Quirnbach, started Autism Hikes! — a group of autistic people and their families from across the area that hike together.
Earlier this month, the family returned to Pack Monadnock with the group. The hikers represented a wide range of the autism spectrum, from profound to high-functioning.
Datta Papatla, one of the hikers, said “it is a good outlet.” Papatla has been hiking with the group for around five years, and he said likes being with other autistic young adults like himself.
Another hiker, Conor Bromley, agreed that the community aspect was a big draw.
“It’s just people that you can get along with,” he said. “They welcome you with open arms. They’re just a bunch of cool people.”
And cool views. One of Bromley’s favorite memories at a peak in the year he’s been hiking with the group had nothing to do with the vista below — it was a fighter jet circling overhead.

Meanwhile, Marinac has been paying attention to the latest national conversation about autism. President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert Kennedy have insisted, despite caution and skepticism from experts, that Tylenol taken by pregnant women is causing autism in newborns.
“I read that, and I say, ‘Where’s the data?’ Marinac said. “Because the data they presented was sparse and often refuted by other experts. In my own personal experience, I didn’t take Tylenol, and the individuals that I know who have kids with autism didn’t take Tylenol. I haven’t found one person affected, and I have a pretty wide circle, and it doesn’t overlay with the rise of autism. Tylenol has been around way before the so-called bubble in the rise of autism, so it doesn’t align with the surge in additional diagnoses. So I don’t see where the data is coming from, and I remain skeptical, because they certainly haven’t proven to me that that is the case.”
She does, however, have concerns about whether a drug she took during pregnancy to forestall labor caused her sons’ autism, but the studies on that are inconclusive.
Many experts attribute at least part of the growing number of autism diagnoses to expanded diagnostic criteria and increased awareness of autism. What was formerly known as Asperger syndrome (which presents less profound symptoms) is now Autism Spectrum Disorder. Some families of those with profound autism argue this expansion shifts focus away from their child’s needs.
“As the world has become more aware of autism, which is a fabulous thing in so many ways,” Marinac said, “funding has often skewed toward individuals who are closer to so-called normal or easier to get over an edge to be able to employ, go to college, live independently, and that kind of stuff, and the individuals who struggle in a profound way are often underrepresented in research.”
Many in the autism community argue there’s no need for a cure and that the condition is part of who they are. Although she acknowledges that because they can’t speak she isn’t certain what her sons want, Marinac believes it’s different for people like Jeff and Will.
“I applaud those who are able to see their symptoms as just a unique facet of the patchwork of skills they bring to the world,” she said. “That doesn’t happen to be the case for my guys. Will and Jeff don’t present with some of the aggressive, self-injurious, maladaptive behaviors that are part of the profound end of the autism spectrum, but for those who do, it is a pain. I question whether anyone wants to live with the internal disruption that causes you to hurt yourself or others.”
She notes Will and Jeff can’t read or write and are still learning daily activities like showering on their own. She doesn’t feel they’re “maximizing their life.”
Still, hiking helped Marinac see her sons differently.
“It changed my life. It truly did. I started seeing capability, not disability,” she said. “Yes, Will and Jeff can’t read, but they can climb a mountain better than a fraction of the entire human population. I mean, not everybody can do what they do.”
And nowhere was that more apparent than when the family trekked up Mount Eisenhower in New Hampshire’s Presidential Range early in their hiking careers.
“There’s a big sign that says, ‘Stop. This is the area with the world’s worst weather. Don’t go further if the weather is bad,” she said. “And I’m thinking, ‘Is this supposed to be a sign? Should we stop here?’ Will, he heard the cog railway. He saw the smoke of the train going up the mountains. It was a pristine, beautiful-sky day. He looked above the tree-lined section. He looked at me. And he ran. He ran. I’m thinking this is my most motor planning-challenged child, running up the hill. It was amazing. I followed him, and so did the rest of us. That’s a metaphor if there was one.”

Jon Ossoff next November. Photo credit: Maya Homan and Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia is set to host what will likely be the most expensive U.S. Senate race in the country next year. But Republicans are still searching for a clear frontrunner to take on Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, who continues to raise huge sums of cash as he prepares to defend his seat.
U.S. Reps. Mike Collins and Buddy Carter, along with former football coach Derek Dooley, are locked in a three-way race to take on the first-term senator. But latest fundraising figures suggest that the party remains largely undecided on a consensus candidate.
Collins, a Butts County trucking company owner and the son of a former congressman, said he raised about $1.9 million since entering the race, plus an additional $1 million transfer from his congressional campaign account. His team is hailing the fundraising numbers as proof that Collins is the “unmistakable frontrunner” in the Republican primary.
Dooley, who boasts an endorsement from Gov. Brian Kemp, also raised a little less than $2 million since he joined the contest. The former Tennessee Volunteers coach and son of Georgia coaching legend Vince Dooley has to walk a fine line between satisfying both Kemp’s allies and MAGA loyalists. But he also has to alleviate concerns about his scant political history and thin ties to Georgia.
And Carter, a wealthy pharmacist from St. Simons Island and the only candidate who entered the race before the start of the third quarter, raised another $1 million over the three-month stretch and loaned himself an additional $2 million. “We didn’t inherit anything from daddy,” he said in an apparent dig at his two rivals. “We’re earning it – every dime, every vote.”
With no leading Republican candidate, all eyes will now turn to President Donald Trump – who can single-handedly turn this into a completely different race with a social media post announcing an endorsement. 
And the president said Wednesday that he is indeed keeping a close eye on the Senate race (and continued doubling down on false claims surrounding his 2020 defeat). “The governor has spoken to me about [the Senate race] a lot, he likes [Dooley] a lot, and I understand that. I haven’t made a decision yet. But I’m following that race very carefully. I think it’s important for Georgia to get a real senator because [Ossoff] is a horrible senator.”
Ossoff continues to be among the top Senate fundraisers in the country, raising another $12 million between July and September and ending the period with more than $20 million stashed away. But it’s only a small fraction of what the race is likely to cost: nearly half a billion dollars was spent on Georgia’s 2022 Senate battle between Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, and Republican Herschel Walker.
And Ossoff has established a reputation as one of his party’s strongest fundraisers. His 2017 campaign in a congressional special election brought in over $30 million. The Atlanta Democrat has now raised more than $200 million since his 2020 Senate bid, when he and Warnock  ousted Republican incumbents to deliver a narrow Democratic Senate majority.
“If we’ve learned anything from recent elections, it’s that raising more money isn’t necessarily an indicator of future electoral success,” said Adam Carlson, a Democratic pollster who has worked behind the scenes on several Georgia campaigns. “But Jon Ossoff raising more than 250% of all three of his potential Republican opponents combined in Q3 is telling.”
Head-to-head polling between Ossoff and his Republican rivals has been sparse. But the incumbent appears to be starting out on solid ground: Morning Consult’s updated tracking poll  found his approval rating at 51% with a disapproval of 34%. But will these numbers hold by this time next year once negative campaign commercials start flooding the airwaves?

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)President Donald Trump has argued that he needs to deploy National Guard troops across state lines to protect federal personnel and property or to support overwhelmed local law enforcement in cities he claims are “overrun” by crime.
But a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and federal crime data shows that Trump’s deployments and proposals have not focused on the nation’s most violent cities. Of the 10 cities population 250,000 or more with the highest violent crime rates, Trump has sent National Guard troops to just one: Memphis, Tennessee.
He has proposed action in just three other top-10 cities: Oakland, California; Baltimore; and St. Louis. All, along with Memphis, are Democratic-led cities.
Several other cities with high violent crime rates — including Milwaukee; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Minneapolis — also are led by Democrats but have not been targeted. Two other Democratic-led cities with high violent crime rates, Cleveland and Kansas City, Missouri, are in states with Republican governors and likewise haven’t been targeted.
Instead, the administration has directed more attention toward larger, Democratic-run cities in Democratic-led states such as Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon, along with Washington, D.C., where violent crime rates are lower than in many other major cities.


In recent months, Trump has pledged strong federal intervention in several cities if, he claims, local officials fail to restore order.
Critics, including Democratic governors and mayors, have challenged his rationale in court, arguing that deployments exceed the president’s authority and undermine local control.
Federal courts have issued orders halting troop deployments in several cities while legal challenges proceed. Most recently, deployments were blocked in Chicago and Portland. The Trump administration is appealing those rulings.
Trump also has suggested deploying troops to New York City and San Francisco.

Stateline’s data analysis shows violent crime has fallen sharply across the United States, including significant drops in some cities that Trump is threatening with military action.
Some crime experts question whether a heightened law enforcement or military presence in major cities will have a lasting impact on crime.
“In the long term, this can’t really be good for public safety,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. La Vigne added that crime may decline in the cities where the Guard is deployed, but that it will likely be an “artificial suppression of crime” because potential victims may avoid downtown areas — an effect that could fade over time.
Violent crime is down
Some Republican governors have welcomed federal support. Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee endorsed the use of Guard troops in Memphis as part of a new citywide anti-crime task force.
Louisiana Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has requested federal funding to activate up to 1,000 Guard members statewide, citing “elevated violent crime rates” in Baton Rouge, New Orleans and Shreveport. Landry also pointed to critical staffing shortages in local law enforcement.
According to local police data through Sept. 6 of this year, however, violent crime in New Orleans is not elevated. It has fallen 16%, with homicides down 20% and property crimes also down 20% compared with the same period in 2024.
Likewise in Baton Rouge, both the overall violent crime rate and the homicide rate declined between 2023 and 2024, falling below 2019 levels, according to a Stateline analysis.
In Shreveport, the overall violent crime rate increased between 2023 and 2024, while the homicide rate fell. Both rates remain higher than in 2019.


The cities with populations of 250,000 or more with the highest violent crime rates were, in order: Memphis, Oakland, Detroit, Baltimore, Cleveland, Kansas City, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Albuquerque and Minneapolis, according to Stateline’s analysis of FBI data.
Available national crime data shows that both violent and property crime continue to decline nationwide. These broad national trends, however, don’t mean every community is experiencing less crime. Some cities and neighborhoods are still seeing higher rates of certain offenses.
According to the Real-Time Crime Index — a free tool that collects crime data from more than 500 law enforcement agencies — violent crime nationwide was 10.7% lower between January and July 2025 than during the same period the previous year, with homicides down 20% and property crime down 12.4%.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice’s most recent crime trends report shows declines in homicides, gun assaults and carjackings across 42 major cities in the first half of 2025 compared with the same period in 2024. The report shows increases in homicide across five cities.
Although the FBI’s findings are a year behind, they align with those numbers. The FBI’s 2024 report, released earlier this year, showed that violent crime fell 4.5% and property crime dropped 8.1% nationally compared with the previous year. Homicides alone declined by nearly 15%.
These improvements mark a continued reversal of the pandemic-era surge in violence, when homicides rose nearly 30% in 2020 — one of the largest single-year increases in U.S. history.
But the pace and direction of those declines vary widely from city to city, and public perception of crime often diverges from what the data shows.
City-by-city details
Nationally, violent and property crime have fallen sharply since peaking in the 1990s — a trend mirrored in most cities, including the five where Trump has deployed or sought to deploy the National Guard.
There may be variations between national figures and local police data because of differences in data collection methods and how crimes are defined.
In Washington, D.C., where the number of reported homicides spiked in 2023, homicides declined by 32% in 2024. The homicide rate fell from 39 per 100,000 residents in 2023, to 26 in 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of FBI crime data.
Local police data shows that, as of Oct. 15, 2025, homicides are down 25% from last year, along with declines in every other major crime category, including property crime.
Los Angeles recorded similar declines between 2023 and 2024 across nearly all crime types, except for arson, which rose from 179 reported incidents to 410, according to a Stateline analysis. Still, overall violent and property crime fell during that period. The city’s homicide rate dropped slightly from 8 per 100,000 residents in 2023 to 7 in 2024.
Los Angeles ranks No. 32 nationally in violent crime among cities with populations over 250,000. FBI data shows a rate of 728 incidents per 100,000 residents, while a Stateline analysis using U.S. Census Bureau population estimates from May shows a slightly lower rate of 715 incidents per 100,000 residents.
As of Oct. 4, 2025, data maintained by the Los Angeles Police Department shows violent crime down 16% and property crime down about 18% compared with the same period last year.
Memphis also reported decreases in most major crime categories between 2023 and 2024, though aggravated assaults increased slightly, according to a Stateline analysis. The city’s homicide rate fell from 57 to 40 per 100,000 residents during that same period.
In 2024, Memphis recorded the highest violent crime rate among major U.S. cities with populations over 250,000 — 2,501 incidents per 100,000 residents, according to FBI data. A Stateline analysis using U.S. Census Bureau population estimates from May show a slightly higher violent crime rate of 2,515 reported incidents per 100,000 residents.
Local police data shows homicides during the first eight months of 2025 are at a six-year low compared with the same period in previous years, and overall crime is at a 25-year low.
Chicago, by contrast, recorded increases in rape, aggravated assault, burglary and larceny-theft between 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis.
While the overall violent crime rate was lower in 2024 than in 2023, the property crime rate rose slightly. The homicide rate declined modestly from 18 to 17 per 100,000 residents. As of Oct. 12, 2025, overall reported crime is down 13% from the same period last year, and murders are down 28%, according to local police data.
US crime rates fell nationwide in 2024, FBI report says

In Portland, most major crime categories fell between 2023 and 2024, though larceny-theft and aggravated assault rose, according to a Stateline analysis. Overall violent and property crime rates were lower in 2024 than in 2023, and the homicide rate declined slightly from about 12 to 11 per 100,000 residents.
Between January and August 2025, compared with the same period in 2024, total crime has remained largely unchanged, according to the Portland Police Bureau’s crime statistics dashboard. However, reported violent crimes are up 3%, property crime is down 4% and “society” crimes such as prostitution and drug offenses have increased significantly.
Public perception of crime
Despite nationwide declines in violent and property crime, most Americans believe crime is getting worse.
A Gallup poll conducted in October 2024 found that 64% of adults thought crime had increased nationally compared with the previous year, while 49% said there was more crime in their local area. A more recent poll from March found that 75% of adults worry about crime either a fair amount or a great deal.
Criminologists and researchers point to several factors behind the gap between public perception and actual crime trends. Political rhetoric and media coverage often emphasize violent incidents, and misleading interpretations of crime data can reinforce fear.
“We live in a society now where people want information and don’t want to take the time to stop and think, and to also consult alternative viewpoints,” said Alex Piquero, a criminology professor at the University of Miami and former director of the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics.
Crime statistics are notoriously difficult to track and understand, in part because much of the data lags behind real-time events. Different sources can also show different trends, depending on how the information is collected.
For example, FBI data relies on voluntary reports from police departments, which may not capture all crimes, while the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ victimization survey excludes homicide and is based on respondents’ experiences in the six months prior to the survey rather than the year it is released. These differences make it challenging for the public to get a clear, up-to-date picture of crime in their communities.
Public perception is further shaped by visible signs of disorder, such as graffiti, abandoned buildings or homeless encampments, according to experts.
People also tend to remember personal anecdotes or news stories that resonate emotionally, rather than abstract statistics. Experts say that this dynamic can be exploited in political messaging, creating a sense of personal risk even when overall crime is declining.
“Crime is kind of one of those things that doesn’t go away in the news cycle because it is relevant to people on a day in and day out basis,” Piquero told Stateline.
Law enforcement presence
Ramped-up police and National Guard patrols in cities nationwide have sparked debate over whether such deployments are effective at curbing crime or mostly serve as a show of force.
Violent crime continues to drop across US cities, report shows

Research suggests that police and military presence affect crime in very different ways. Targeted policing in high-crime “hot spots” reduces crime in those areas, according to experts.
“Police are one part of an overall crime prevention strategy, and they are very effective at disrupting what we call ‘hot spots,’” Piquero said.
The National Guard and other military forces, on the other hand, have historically played a very limited role in crime prevention, according to experts. National Guard troops are typically deployed during civil unrest or natural disasters, rather than as a routine crime-fighting tool.
A 2023 research paper led by Brown University examining Cali, Colombia, suggests that military policing rarely outperforms traditional police in reducing crime. In many cases, crime declines are short lived, and rates often go up once military forces leave.
Military deployments in cities are unlikely to produce the sustained reductions in crime that targeted policing can achieve, in part because the National Guard does not receive the same training as local police officers on when and how to use force or implement crime prevention strategies.










In the long term, this can't really be good for public safety.


– Nancy La Vigne, criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University


Some experts say that these deployments may be more effective when requested and guided by local officials who can define the need, duration and scope of their support.
Experts also caution that the presence of military personnel can heighten tensions or erode community trust, potentially undermining the relationships local police have built to effectively address crime. Such deployments may also have economic consequences if residents or tourists avoid city centers out of fear.

(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention graphic, cdc.gov)A new study shows that kidney cancer rates in Merrimack are about 38% higher than expected and points to another possible cluster in Manchester, a Dartmouth researcher reported to a state commission Oct. 10.
The findings are one outcome of a preliminary study evaluating the need for future kidney cancer research in the Merrimack area, Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine Associate Professor of Epidemiology Megan Romano said at a meeting of the Commission on the Environmental and Public Health Impacts of Perfluorinated Chemicals. On their own, the data are not sufficient to point to any specific causes, nor to determine whether the two towns’ elevated kidney cancer rates are related. But, she told commission members, researchers believe the study has laid the groundwork for further investigation into those questions and more, including on the role of environmental contaminants like PFAS.
“Ultimately, it is our hope that a future research study will clarify the potential links between environmental exposures and health outcomes in this region, and provide insight for public health initiatives,” Romano said.
The study utilized data from the New Hampshire State Cancer Registry, a catalog of cancer cases diagnosed or treated in New Hampshire, to assess the rates of kidney cancers in Merrimack and eight surrounding towns compared to the rest of New Hampshire. The data was broken into three time periods: 1995-2003, 2004-2012, and 2013-2021.
Most of those towns did not show elevated kidney cancer rates during those periods, Romano said. But in Merrimack between 2013 and 2021, the review showed a 38% excess of kidney cancer cases. This aligns with a finding first documented in a 2021 state report that estimated kidney cancer was 42% higher than expected in Merrimack. 
The data also show something new, Romano said: an 18% excess of cases in Manchester from the same time period. The Manchester data also include more cases in women than researchers would have expected, she added. However, Romano cautioned against “over-interpreting” the Manchester data until more information can be gathered.
The report also documented a third, 83% excess of kidney cancer in the town of Hudson during the 1995-2003 time period, according to the report. The Hudson cancer rate then sank back to expected rates in the following time periods.
Romano also noted the data did not show unusual rates of cancer in people under 20.
“The very young folks are not seemingly getting excess kidney cancer in this area,” she said.
In 2021, when the initial state report was published, Merrimack area residents said the statistics validated the high cancer rates they had observed anecdotally among members of their community. Residents from in and around Merrimack — including some who had themselves been diagnosed with cancer — connected those rates with high levels of environmental PFAS contamination in the area.
Testing has shown that soil and groundwater in Merrimack and some surrounding towns are contaminated with PFAS, toxic chemicals used in manufacturing that are also called “forever chemicals” for their long lifespans in the environment. The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services links their high levels in the Merrimack area to the former Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics plant, which NHDES and local activists say released PFAS emissions from its manufacturing activities into the air for decades. 
In Merrimack and Manchester, the study showed that excessive rates seem to be driven primarily by a specific kind of kidney cancer called clear cell renal carcinoma, Romano said. Cancer researchers have linked different types of PFAS to cancers in humans, including renal cell carcinoma. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has categorized one common type of PFAS, PFOA, as carcinogenic, meaning cancer-causing; the agency also lists another PFAS, PFOS, as possibly carcinogenic.
However, in her report, Romano said the research team did not yet have the data they need to take up the complicated task of untangling a possible cause for the cluster. While the analysis they conducted confirmed that kidney cancer rates are elevated in the Merrimack and Manchester areas, she said, researchers do not yet have the level of information they would need to evaluate the many possible factors that may have contributed to that statistic.
More research, involving more participants, more experts, and more robust data, will be necessary to approach that question, according to Romano. But this work, she said, showed a path forward. Future directions might entail partnering with the Department of Environmental Services, which demonstrated as part of this study that it could produce a database of water testing histories from across the state, Romano said. Researchers could cross reference that data with the residential histories of study participants to help paint a picture of each person’s exposure to potential contaminants.
But that work, Romano said, is intensive. The researchers involved anticipate that acquiring the funding they need to move forward will be a major challenge, she said.
“The current climate for federal research funding is very uncertain,” she said. “… It is admittedly a difficult funding climate that we are currently facing in biomedical research.” 
However, Romano said, it was clear that residents and researchers alike were highly driven to keep the project moving ahead. A poll administered during the study indicated that residents were very motivated to get answers, she said, and the researchers that have been involved in the study for multiple years are hoping to continue.
“We all remain very excited about this work,” she said. “… We are acutely aware of the importance of the work and very committed to doing the best that we can.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/kidneycancercdc-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-17 05:00:54.743722

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images.)If individual insurance subsidies are allowed to expire at the end of the year, it won’t just harm the millions, including Ohioans, who use it to address conditions like high blood pressure and pneumonia. It will also rip thousands of people out of treatment for opioid-use disorder and increase overdose deaths, the CEO of a treatment company said on Tuesday.
Much of the federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 as congressional Republicans resist calls to extend subsidies for insurance bought in marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act. The subsidies are set to expire on Dec. 31, while open enrollment for next year begins in two weeks.
Amid the uncertainty, six states have already posted prices for insurance in the marketplaces next year. U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., posted on X an insurance quote received by one constituent, Axios reported. Coverage that cost $307 a month with the subsidy would cost $906 a month without it.
In Ohio, where about 583,000 get coverage on the exchanges, insurance companies have proposed increasing pricing by as much as 40%. It’s unclear whether those proposals include the possible loss of the subsidies.
The health nonprofit KFF estimates that on average, the cost of coverage will more than double for 24 million Americans if the subsidies are allowed to expire.
That won’t just result in many more uninsured Americans, said Cooper Zelnick, CEO of Groups. It will put treatment out of reach for hundreds of thousands of Americans suffering from opioid-use disorder.
The company has 20,000 patients in 12 states, including Ohio. Instead of billing insurers or Medicaid for services such as doctor visits or drug tests, Groups is paid based on outcomes as a consequence of its “wraparound” services. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThat makes it the largest “value-based” provider of opioid treatment in the country, Zellnick said.
For many, those outcomes will be in jeopardy if the ACA insurance subsidies are allowed to expire, he said.
“We serve 1,500 people every week nationally who have coverage through the ACA exchanges who will no longer be able to afford insurance once the subsidies expire,” he said. “We believe a significant portion of those folks will wrongly not qualify for Medicaid and not be eligible for employer-sponsored insurance.”
For people in recovery to get coverage through the exchanges, they most likely have gotten things together enough to hold down one job or several. If coverage is no longer affordable, they will face the stress of no health coverage for themselves and their families at the same time they lose treatment for their addiction.
For every person who backslides into using, that means more kids growing up with the chaos and neglect of drug-addicted parents, more people languishing in jails and prisons, more uncompensated ER visits, and more absenteeism from work.
And then there are the people who simply won’t be here. The ACA health subsidies were implemented in 2021. They’re credited with helping bring down the rate of the uninsured in the United States to an all-time low of 8% in the first quarter of 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Meanwhile, the number of overdose deaths plummeted from 111,451 in the 12 months ending in August 2023 to 73,690 over the period ending last April, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s a merciful decline of more than one-third.
Zelnick said the drop is partly attributable to treatment financed through the ACA subsidies and through Medicaid. Letting the ACA subsidies expire will easily result in half a million opioid-addicted Americans losing coverage — and treatment, he said.
“We massively celebrated getting (overdose deaths) down 10%, 15%, 20%,” Zelnick said. “That’s 10,000 or 15,000 or 20,000 lives saved. If 500,000 people lose access to care, you could quite easily see a world where overdose deaths return to levels not seen since 2022, or 2023.”
Zelnick said that even more important than access to treatment, widespread losses of coverage will cause people in recovery to lose hope. 
“Addiction treatment is a necessary-but-insufficient condition for success,” he said. “It’s not that treatment gives you a meaningful life. It’s that treatment gives you the opportunity to build a meaningful life. That involves work. That involves taking care of your family. That involves participating in your community. 
“The person we’re talking about went through hell. Went through treatment. Got a job, and is supporting their family. If suddenly, they don’t get medication, they get sick and can’t go to work and they lose that job. Once you lose that job, you lose hope. And once you lose hope it seems futile to face one day at a time.”

The shadow. 
In the photo, the outline of a person holding a camera darkens an educational plaque at the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site in Topeka. The bright, slanting sunlight pushes the shadows long — long enough that the person taking the photo can’t avoid being in it.
Some people might see that shadow, obscuring the bottom corner of the display, as a flaw of the photo. It’s my favorite part.
That nameless person, in an act of mini-political resistance, left their home and photographed the sign as part of Save Our Signs, a nationwide effort to document and preserve the signs at sites operated by the National Park Service. The shadow memorializes their tiny bit of activism against the Trump administration’s censorship, which both looms and grows.
A few weeks ago I wrote a column about the collaborative online effort led by librarians and researchers. After the Trump administration threatened to scrub language on signs at national historic sites, the organizers of Save Our Signs nudged a phalanx of photographers to submit images.
At that time, three of the five sites administered by the National Park Service in Kansas had not yet been documented with photos, and the people at Save Our Signs were reviewing and confirming photos. So the images had not been posted.
This week, Save Our Signs posted the submitted photos, including photos from four of the five Kansas locations. Those documented locations? Brown v. Board of Education, Fort Scott, Nicodemus and the Tallgrass Prairie.
Fort Larned sadly does not have any photos posted yet.
The page for Nicodemus features 47 photographs, including the exteriors of buildings, educational signs and an artist biography. As a photography teacher, I can confirm that none of the photos are compositional masterpieces — but that is exactly the point. The photos plainly represent what is there. No need for rule-of-thirds composition or dramatic lighting. The best photos allow us to read the text on each sign clearly so that we can monitor and critique any changes that the Department of the Interior makes.  
As I clicked through the images this week on the website, I was simultaneously encouraged and chagrined.
An image from the Fort Scott National Historic Site, titled “Fort Scott Today.” (Save our Signs)
Encouraged, because the website stands as patriotic proof. Consider the federal employees who spent days and weeks of their professional lives creating these historical displays. At Fort Scott, there is an aerial map, which illustrates the historic site while combining it with a timeline. It’s more effective than a glitzy drone video on a big screen.
You’ll find even more patriotism if you join me in appreciating the folks who created the Save Our Signs website. The dedication that they show to free speech and their opposition to censorship hold up the First Amendment. Add to that their commitment to telling America’s full story, an honest effort pointing our nation in a virtuous direction, rather than the Trump administration’s threats to tamp down historical truths.
Staring in the face of all that patriotism — the federal employees, the amateur photographers, the website creators — is the grim possibility that these signs might begin to disappear, because these signs might be whitewashed soon with this administration’s metaphorical bleach.
If these signs continue to be altered, Save Our Signs might provide an insurgent online history, but it won’t be able to match the in-person experience. The magic of the National Park Service cannot live exclusively online.
My son and I clicked our way through the photo archive last night. First, we realized how few national parks we have visited. Next, we visited the page of photographs dedicated to the Statue of Liberty National Monument.
An image from the Statue of Liberty National Monument, titled “Cover of Puck Magazine sign.” (Save our Signs)
On that page, there is an image of a plaque, which reads, “This Puck magazine cover pollutes the likeness of the Statue of Liberty to call attention to the widespread lynchings, disenfranchisement, segregation, and poverty that African Americans experienced after the Civil War.” The same caption exists online on the National Park Service website, titled “Embracing Liberty.”
The online database allows us to intellectually process the message. Yes, widespread lynchings. Yes, disenfranchisement. Yes, segregation. Yes, poverty.
But to swallow those words while standing at the base of the Statue of Liberty like we both did, the historical tension pulls. Beyond anything intellectual, you feel the sinew of America straining. Why was France inspired to gift Lady Liberty to the United States in the midst of so much American injustice? How does that statue look to the African Americans of New York City? The plaque surfaces those questions without asking them.
These are the profound questions that our nation’s greatest treasures — statues, mountain ranges, forts, battlefields — are poised to ask.
In fact, the tense questions are as much our treasures as the statue itself.
Those same locations would stand mute with context. Without the uncomfortable history, it’s just a schoolhouse in Topeka. Or an ambitious town on the plains called Nicodemus. Or a pretty prairie of wildflowers.
The alternative? That visitors to national park sites will navigate to the Save Our Signs website and read the uncensored history: visitors standing, cellphones in hand, pinching and zooming and clicking. Pointing to blank spots in the landscape, the visitors might wonder where the signs once stood.
If that is our shared national experience of visiting when we visit these sites, the Trump administration will have stripped away a central charm of visiting, because these places should guide us away from our phones, instead soaking up our nation’s history — without meddling from the person in power at the moment.

Sears/Maryland Matters)A plan to give undocumented immigrants access to Maryland’s state health insurance marketplace next year has been put off until 2028 by state officials, citing recent federal policies affecting immigrants as well as overall uncertainty in health care markets.
The delay was the biggest change outlined for state lawmakers Thursday by health care and health insurance officials discussing the impact of recent Trump administration policies on Maryland’s health care system.
The joint virtual meeting of the Senate Finance and the House Health and Government Operations committees went over policies that are expected to increase health insurance costs,  create barriers to access plans and reduce federal funding to Maryland, among other effects. The briefing also laid out the ways in which Maryland might respond to those changes.
Michele Eberle, executive director of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, said one of the changes she was the “most unhappy about” was a delay in the implementation of the Access to Care Act, in light of recent federal developments.
Currently, undocumented immigrants can purchase health care plans directly from insurers. But they are barred from using the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange to compare plans and find the most appropriate insurance for their households.

The 2024 Access to Care Act would have change that by opening the marketplace to undocumented residents, allowing them access to the marketplace,where they could comparison-shop health plans from different providers. It was to take effect next year if the state could get a waiver from the federal government, which is got while President Joe Biden was still in office.
The law would not have given undocumented residents access to the federal subsidies to make health care affordable for many customers. But, for those who could afford to buy individual plans without a subsidy, it would at least have given them a chance to use the online marketplace as a tool to weigh their options.
But with the Trump administration’s antagonistic approach toward undocumented immigrants, along with significant changes to health care funding, Eberle said the exchange decided to delay opening the marketplace to undocumented residents until 2028.
“We worked really hard under the last [Biden] administration to make sure that it was approved — and we were all set to go,” Eberle said. “We did not anticipate at that time that we would have the Marketplace Integrity Rule or HR 1 that would throw up a whole bunch of new requirements that we would have to put in place in short order.”
The rule and the bill — also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill — overhaul parts of the Affordable Care Act and other federal health regulations, and states like Maryland are having to focus their resources on complying with those changes.
The Marketplace Integrity Rule also revoked a Biden-era decision that classified immigrants covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program — for undocumented immigrants who were brought to this country as children — as “lawfully present” individuals. Being lawfully present would have given DACA recipients access to the federal subsidies that help make health care coverage affordable for many.
Without the classification, DACA recipients lose access to the subsidies, a change that is set to affect about 300 DACA recipients in Maryland currently benefiting from those subsidies.
But federal decisions targeting Maryland’s undocumented and immigrant populations were just part of what Insurance Commissioner Marie Grant called “gloomy but important” health care-related updates under the Trump administration.
State OKs 13.4% average premium hike for state’s health care marketplace plans

Grant noted the significant rise expected next year in insurance premiums — due in part to the anticipated expiration of pandemic-era federal tax credits that bring down costs of individual plans purchased through the Affordable Care Act.
In September, the Maryland Insurance Administration approved an average premium increase of 13.4% across plans next year, less than what insurance companies initially asked for, but still a significant hit in monthly costs for many low- to middle-income families.
Health care advocates fear people will drop their coverage because they can no longer afford their plans if those credits expire. But carriers say the rate increases are needed to offset the number of people they expect will choose to go without health insurance — due to high costs.
The General Assembly approved funding this year that would partially replace the soon-to-expire federal tax credits for the coming year. But those state subsidies are only temporary fixes, analysts say, and even with that assistance plenty of people will still pay more each month for coverage than they did this year.
Congress could vote to extend those tax credits, which is at the heart to the current government shutdown debate. But Grant notes that time is running out to make that decision and have it effect 2026 health care plans.
“We’re expecting those enhanced tax credits to expire by the end of this year, unless Congress takes action to extend them,” she said. “The clock is ticking. It is … likely we’re getting to a point where, unless this extension happened in the next couple of days, it is likely too late to have carriers refile rates for 2026.”

Gabriel Acevero (D-Montgomery) speaks at a news conference Thursday in Baltimore where a coalition of environmental and community health advocates said the state needs to move faster to advance a Clean Heat Standard for residential heating equipment. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)A group of Maryland environmental advocates is pushing the state to hasten its development of rules that would bolster electric heating systems inside homes, including heat pumps.
Under a June 2024 executive order from Gov. Wes Moore (D), the state must establish Clean Heat Rules, aimed at reducing air pollution from fossil fuel-burning heating equipment.
State officials said they are progressing toward meeting the goal. But advocates said Thursday they want to see more urgency from the state’s Department of the Environment.
“While the transition to heat pumps is happening, it’s not happening fast enough to meet our climate commitments,” said Anne Havemann, general counsel at the Chesapeake Climate Action Network. “It’s also not happening equally across income brackets. Right now, it’s mostly higher-income Marylanders who are making the switch.”
That’s what brought a number of nonprofit groups to Baltimore’s Patterson Park on Thursday,  to announce formation of the Maryland Clean Heat Coalition to push for the change. The groups — including the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative, the Sierra Club’s Maryland chapter and Interfaith Power and Light of the DMV, among others — are planning to launch a $200,000 digital advertising campaign focused on the benefits of transitioning to all-electric heating.
They were joined by Del. Gabriel Acevero (D-Montgomery), who said that electrifying  more heating equipment in residential buildings could help prevent explosions tied to natural gas pipes.
Trump administration asks court to revoke Ocean City wind project approval

A 2016 explosion in a Silver Spring apartment building killed 7 people and injured dozens more, and was attributed to a buildup of natural gas from an unconnected vent line, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.
“We need to ensure that we are not just avoiding instances like that, but providing alternative clean energy solutions right here in the state of Maryland,” Acevero said. “But also, more importantly, ensuring that my constituents, Marylanders, have affordable energy and their bills do not continue to skyrocket, which is what we’re seeing today.”
Eventually, the standards would require property owners to transition end-of-life furnaces and boilers to electric alternatives — a policy that could hit low-income ratepayers hard, according to a new analysis from the Sierra Club Maryland Chapter and the Center for Progressive Reform.
The rule could mean that 14,000 space heating units and up to 22,000 water heaters a year in low-income Maryland households need to be replaced with heat pumps, the study said. It would cost $185 million more than in-kind replacements.
But the switch is expected to save low-income ratepayers money in the long-run. The study suggests that the energy bill savings would reach $350 million per year (in 2024 dollars) by 2050.
There would also be positive health impacts, advocates say. A 2023 study from GHHI estimated that pollution from fossil fuel heating systems was costing $1.3 billion in health costs annually in Maryland, because it contributes to respiratory issues and asthma
It comes as high electric bills continue to raise an outcry — and attract attention from Maryland legislators. This past legislative session, lawmakers voted to give ratepayers two bill credits, worth an avearage $40 bill each, in addition to longer-term measures that fast-track certain energy storage and generation projects through the Maryland Public Service Commission.
The state is also under pressure to meet its ambitious climate goals, which will require an increasing number of buildings and homes to go electric. The state has set a goal of reducing its carbon emissions 60% below 2006 levels by 2031 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2045.
Per Moore’s 2024 order, MDE actually must issue two clean heat regulations. The agency declined to comment on the coalition’s demands, pointing to a webpage about the standards under development.
One is called the Zero-Emissions Heating Equipment Standard, which will set emissions standards for newly manufactured residential-scale furnaces, boilers and water heaters.

The other is the Clean Heat Standard, that will set requirements for heating fuel providers, such as pipeline gas utilities and fuel oil/propane delivery companies, to lower their emissions over time by delivering cleaner fuels, installing electric equipment or weatherizing buildings, according to the MDE website.
A timeline from the department indicates that the state plans to adopt the Zero-Emissions Heating rule some time in 2026, with the standard taking effect in 2029. The timeline calls for adoption of a rule to set a credit system for the Clean Heat Standard in 2026. For now, MDE has proposed reporting requirements for fuel delivery companies, which would take effect next year.
GHHI President and CEO Ruth Ann Norton said the federal government’s recent efforts to pull back funding and tax credits for clean energy projects shows that the ball is in Maryland’s court to advance policy change more rapidly.
“It’s on the state. It’s on us to be doing this. It’s on the governor to lead this,” Norton said. “We strongly feel that adopting these standards as quickly as possible means that people will be healthier sooner.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC07936-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-17 02:57:47.640970

Wes Moore and the General Assembly stick to a plan that calls for up to $1.75 billion in new borrowing in the coming fiscal year.. (File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)A key fiscal panel is recommending the state continue with a plan to borrow up to $1.75 billion for capital projects in the coming fiscal year, despite the potential for fiscal headwinds from the  federal government shutdown and layoffs of federal workers.
The recommendation Thursday by the Capital Debt Affordability Committee sticks to a borrowing plan originally set two years ago.
“Maintaining the current level of debt at the $1.75 billion will enable the state to continue to make progress on priority capital needs, including school construction, economic development, housing affordability and replacement of state-owned facilities,” said Acting Budget Secretary Marc Nicole. “Recommending any less than $1.75 billion will hamper our progress on these critical investments.”
Approval from the panel took less than 10 minutes.
The unanimous recommendation by the committee is not binding on the governor nor the legislature. But the recommendation is not expected to encounter problems as it is a continuation of a proposal to increase capital spending approved by the panel two years ago.
“Maintaining the level at $1.75 billion should not raise significant concerns for the two bond rating agencies that are continuing to rate us AAA, as we are matching our prior year plans,” Nicole said.
Panel lowers current revenue estimates, issues weak outlook for coming fiscal year

Earlier this year, Moody’s downgraded the state from AAA to Aa1. It was the first time since 1973 that Moody’s had not awarded the state its highest credit rating. The change ended the more than three decades of Maryland earning the highest bond rating from all three major bond-rating agencies.
The panel voted in 2023 to recommend a 45% increase in borrowing after Gov. Larry Hogan (R) held down borrowing over his two terms in office.
There are limits to how much the state can borrow.
The total amount of outstanding state debt should not exceed 4% of personal income in the state. Also, all tax-rated debt should not exceed 8% of tax revenues.
Rebecca Ruff, director of debt management for the Maryland State Treasurer, said the recommendation is below both guidelines.
State property taxes repay general obligation bond borrowing. State law calls for the rates to be set in an amount sufficient to repay the annual debt service.
The current rates — 11.2 cents per $100 of assessed value on commercial and residential property and 28 cents per $100 of assessed value on utilities — have not changed since 2007. The state has seen an increase in property tax revenue with rising assessments.
Even so, the tax rates do not cover the full amount of borrowing. Hundreds of millions in cash are taken from the operating budget every year to close the gap.
By 2035, the state could need a general fund subsidy of as much as $650 million to cover bond repayment, according to an estimate released earlier this month.

Roughly 150 people stayed at an emergency shelter at the Alaska National Guard Readiness Center. Others stayed with family or friends or in accommodations arranged by the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation in Bethel.  
On Thursday morning, evacuees lined up to board the second flight to Anchorage, landing at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. Emergency shelters have been set up at Alaska Airlines Center, the Egan Center, and city recreation centers at Spenard and Fairview. 
An estimated 2,000 evacuees are expected in Anchorage by Friday, said Mayor Suzanne LaFrance. 
Dolly Martin, 19, her mother and four siblings were headed to stay with family. 
“My emotions are all over the place,” she said. 
Another flight was scheduled for Thursday afternoon as new evacuees arrive from Kipnuk and Kwigillingok. 
 Seventy-five people were expected to be picked up in Kwigillingok on Thursday. In Kipnuk, the evacuation is largely complete, said Lieutenant Colonel Brendan Holbrook, commander of the 207th Aviation Troop Command with the Alaska Army National Guard. 
“Kipnuk is evacuated for everyone that wants to be evacuated. There are about 50 or 100 that stayed behind, that don’t want to come out,” Holbrook said, and estimates there are 200 to 300 people in Kwigillingok who are staying there. 
The storm killed one woman in Kwigillingok, 67-year-old Ella Mae Kashatok, and left two family members missing, Vernon Pavil and Chester Kashatok. The local search and rescue effort is still ongoing, led by volunteers and village public safety officers with the Association of Village Council Presidents. 
As damage continues to be assessed, emergency crews have dispatched to begin repairs on utilities and sewer systems, water, gas lines, roads, boardwalks, boats and structures. At least 15 communities have reported“substantial damage” across the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region.
On Thursday, Gov. Mike Dunleavy submitted a formal request to the Trump administration for a Presidential Disaster Declaration asking Trump to declare a major disaster for Alaska, and provide support and federal aid to help with the recovery.

Local officials have dropped, for now, a proposal to add express lanes to the heavily traveled bridge. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Washington-area leaders voted unanimously Wednesday to drop plans for express lanes across the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge from the region’s long-range strategic plan, but to study the project further with the possibility of bringing it back next year.
The I-495 Southside Express Lanes project called for extending Virginia express lanes another 11 miles, to stretch from the Springfield interchange in Fairfax County, Virginia, and across the Wilson Bridge to the Maryland Route 210 interchange in Prince George’s County.
Supporters said the project would ease traffic congestion between Maryland and Virginia, but critics said the plans lacked detail and the project would lead to an increase in vehicles and air pollution levels.
Wednesday’s vote by the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board pulls the project for now, but directs the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) to improve its studies and report back next year on the status and outcomes of its work with all relevant jurisdictions. The Washington Council of Governments is scheduled to take a final vote Dec. 17 on the plan to submit to the Federal Highway and the Federal Transit administrations.
“The project is not dead,” said board Chair Walter Alcorn, a Fairfax County supervisor. He said the board could restore the project at a later date, but Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C., must first agree on the specific aspects of the expressway extension that advocates and opponents say will create significant impacts.
The delay was welcomed by board member Eric Olson, a Prince George’s County Council member, who agreed more study is needed.

“I think we, as a region, came together and understood that this was not the right thing for the region and certainly not now,” Olson said. “There are a lot of unanswered questions, a lot of things that need to be looked at as far as the Woodrow Wilson Bridge corridor.”
Alcorn said one problem was that there is “not an agreement and consensus by the different jurisdictions through which the project would go.” But he believes some improvements will be needed.
“There still needs to be more work to be done, but we’ll see. In my opinion, there does need to be some sort of project that would improve traffic now and in the future on the Beltway, and provide those transit options that we need all over the region,” Alcorn said.
In a statement, VDOT said the board’s decision will allow the agency to continue its work with its development of the project, and resubmit it in 2026 for inclusion in the region’s long-range transportation plan.
“These transportation improvements will provide near-term benefits and improve the lives of the hundreds of thousands of travelers who rely on the I-495 Southside corridor each day, as well as the surrounding residents and communities,” the VDOT statement said.
Virginia has been conducting a study since 2022 on the addition of the express lanes, which speakers at Wednesday’s meeting referenced. About 13 people spoke at the meeting, many in opposition to the project, with some noting that the state’s study lacked cost estimates for decommissioning private toll lanes in hopes of building a Metrorail line. Others said the express lanes would lead to an increase in vehicles and air pollution levels.
“Only by clearly weaving out the preferred alternative can the region ensure that there’s collaboration among jurisdictions to explore alternatives,” said Bill Pugh, transportation and climate director for the Coalition for Smarter Growth, emphasizing the need for sustainable transportation alternatives and what he called the negative environmental and social impacts of the project.
The project’s backers say express lanes would reduce travel times and provide more reliable arrival estimates for drivers. The lanes would minimize vehicle idling and ultimately decrease pollution, supporters suggested.

“It’s been said that what we need now is a 21st-century multimodal solution, and this project delivers exactly that solution,” said Richard Parsons, a representative of the Suburban Maryland Transportation Alliance. “It outperforms all other options in terms of expanding person-throughput and reducing congestion delays, while preserving the right of way for future rail.”
Although Jason Stanford, a representative from the Northern Virginia Transportation Alliance, supports the project that provides “the greatest congestion relief,” he added that deferring the project would be a “wise decision” because “the stakes are too high to do nothing.”
Board members, including Virginia Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, voted unanimously to keep the project out of the long-term plan. She added that if the item had come down to an up-or-down vote, it would have failed due to concerns about the project’s environmental and community impacts.
“We feel this is a very important issue,” Boysko said. “We need to build consensus with the entire region.”
Olson said more study is needed on the plan.
“We do need better transportation,” Olson said. “We do need to look at alternatives — like transit, like transportation demand management — but it was not even close to being ready to be put into a regional plan to advance.”

I didn’t set out to join a cross-partisan movement. I just wanted to stop judging people by their bumper stickers.


I consider myself a cynical optimist: expect goodness, plan for chaos. Maybe that comes from too many tech fails running fundraising events —or wrangling our family to church, only to leave in a scuffle, shame-jogging to the minivan while avoiding eye contact with parishioners.
Life shapes you. You show up with good intentions, while bracing for a wayward punch. Still hoping, deep down, that good will win.
Somewhere along the way, it wasn’t only the news cycle where grace fell short. Politics got louder. Tension arrived before dinner guests did. Judgment crept into grocery-store lines. Hope shrank. Rage grew. I didn’t like what it was doing to me —or to the people I love most. Turns out I’m not alone.

Marie McNamara
Politics has stopped being about policies and started doubling as a moral scoreboard. It comes as no surprise that nearly half of Americans say the opposing party is “downright evil.” 
It’s what researchers are calling the ‘perception gap’ —our national habit of assuming people on the other side are far worse than they really are.
The result? A false sense that America is extremely divided when in truth, most Americans fall into the Exhausted Majority —not firmly on the far right or left, just worn out. And yet, these voices rarely get heard.
Outrage gets airtime and solutions get ghosted. So personally: I went quiet. Retreated. But silence isn’t peace.
Honestly, I miss the old chaos. Because even in that, we were feeling. Still talking. Not just texting headlines in a group chat and waiting for reactions. At least we hadn’t given up on each other.
That slow erosion of faith in people? It made me twitchy. I logged off most social media and switched up my news sources. Then I registered online for something called a Braver Angels ‘Depolarizing Within’ workshop. Soon, my newsfeed shifted —less doomsday, more human.


Guess what?  Polarization sells. We —Americans— are the content being traded for our clicks. (Hmmm… maybe this is something we can all agree on?)
Braver Angels started back in 2016 —a nod to Lincoln’s plea for “better angels of our nature” on the eve of the Civil War. It’s a national nonprofit that carries that spirit forward —bringing Reds, Blues, and Independents together not to change minds, but to talk and listen to each other again.
I wasn’t met with judgment. They offered tools —like how to disagree without dehumanizing. Turns out, in heated conversations, I was the one throwing gasoline on the fire. Interrupting. Assuming. Labeling. Not my best moments.
To this day —when I feel myself starting to spiral— I hear Taylor Swift’s chorus: “It’s me. Hi. I’m the problem, it’s me.”
That realization led me to take their Families and Politics workshop—and WOW, did that one hit home. Both for the family I have today and the one I was raised in.
My dad was an affectionate and warm Republican —a Korean War vet and devoted watcher of war documentaries. He was also the guy who could finish The New York Times crossword in one sitting —in pen. He considered M*A*S*H* educational TV; Family Ties? Basically communist.
My mom was a thrifty, natural caregiver —and sterner than Dad. A Democrat with an Irish no-nonsense attitude meant to keep us in line, but she’d wait until he fell asleep to secretly watch Dallas. (Too scandalous!) They disagreed on plenty —but their love was never in doubt. They didn’t fit neatly into a red or blue box; their values weren’t branded.
Most Americans long for that kind of respectful —even loving— difference of opinion. We just need spaces —and people— brave enough to lead the way.
Now I help lead the Connecticut Braver Angels Alliance, working to spread these tools by convening and showing that we can live together, even when we disagree. We don’t show up to be convinced. We show up to connect.
So maybe the problem was me. But that means I get to be part of the solution.

In an exchange markedly less heated than last week’s gubernatorial debate, both men portrayed themselves as defenders of the law who would work to stem crime statewide, enforce consumer protections and uphold Virginians’ rights.
Jones text scandal reshapes Virginia’s attorney general race — and tests Spanberger’s ticket

Throughout the debate, moderated by Virginia State Bar president Brett Marsten, Jones  emphasized his willingness to push back against President Donald Trump’s administration in court and accused Miyares of aligning with federal policies that constitute federal overreach.  
Miyares pledged to continue cracking down on illegal immigration to thwart gang violence and repeatedly called Jones’ character into question by referencing the former state lawmaker’s past reckless driving charge and violent text messages, both revealed in recent weeks. 
Before the questions got underway, Jones used his opening statement to address text messages he’d sent to a Republican state lawmaker in 2022 in which he’d referenced shooting former House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, and Gilbert’s children dying “in their mother’s arms” in order for the party to take action on gun safety laws. The texts prompted Republicans inside and outside the state — from Miyares and Gov. Glenn Youngkin to Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance — to call for Jones to drop out of the race. 
“I am sorry to Speaker Gilbert. I am sorry to his family. I am sorry to my family, and I’m sorry to every single Virginian,” Jones said. 
“You had three years to apologize,” Miyares countered in his opening monologue, who urged Jones to leave the race multiple times during the evening. 
 Dueling visions of how to protect Virginians

Jones, a litigator in D.C. and former state delegate from Norfolk, is a married father of two sons. He is the grandson of a pioneering civil rights attorney and the son of a longtime state delegate and circuit court judge. 
Miayres is ending his first term as attorney general after being elected to the office in 2021. The son of a mother who immigrated to the U.S. from Cuba, Miyares is also a former state delegate and a prosecutor in the Virginia Beach Commonwealth’s Attorney Office, and the first Latino to serve in a statewide office in Virginia. 
On the debate stage, both men promised to protect Virginians, but professed vastly different approaches to doing so.
When not jabbing at Jones about the scandals, Miyares depicted himself as “the people’s protector” and touted a state program he’s helped lead in that has helped reduce crime and noted consumer protection lawsuits he’s undertaken to shield Virginians from rising prescription costs and other challenges.  
Jones countered that Miyares would seldom take a stand against Trump, saying Miyares is “too weak to stand up to the president.” He also pointed out that Miyares hadn’t emulated attorneys generals in different states who have joined attempts to block the president from deploying the National Guard to their states and to hinder proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act. He also repeatedly pummeled Miyares and Republican leaders over mass federal workforce reductions this year, a hot topic in the state that is home to hundreds of thousands of federal workers.

 Energy and environment

Each pointed to their voting records in the General Assembly, too, with the conversation lingering on energy legislation. 
Miyares said he supported an “all of the above” approach to meeting Virginia’s energy needs, in a nod to Youngkin’s refrain about the importance of embracing multiple energy sources. He reminded the audience of how his office negotiated Dominion Energy’s offshore wind plan to reduce ratepayers’ share of the costs. 
The attorney general also described the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) as a “tax on working class Virginians that I oppose and that Jay Jones supports.” 
Jones noted his support of the Virginia Clean Economy Act and Virginia’s membership in the  RGGI— measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions in the state. Jones called the state’s withdrawal from RGGI “patently illegal” and doubled down on his support of  the VCEA, which set benchmarks for utility companies to phase out fossil fuel reliance over time.
Jones also called for the state to “hold our biggest corporate polluter accountable — that’s Dominion Energy,” and bashed Miyares for accepting campaign donations from the utility. 
 Criminal justice 

Miyares reminded the audience several times that Jones voted in favor of a law allowing inmates with good behavior to trim their prison sentences, casting it as evidence of Jones being a “criminal-first, victim-last politician.” 
Of the 19% of people who were released with the earned sentence credits that were reconvicted last year in the demographic, 5% were reincarcerated, Virginia Department of Corrections data shows.
While neither man followed through for an interview when The Mercury recently examined the program’s effectiveness, several beneficiaries said it gave them the chance to live fulfilling, responsible lives. 
Jones said he would prioritize protecting civil rights and Virginia communities. He also referenced his three-point public safety plan, which he said was created in conjunction with state and local law enforcement officials.

 Housing rights

On housing, Jones prodded Miyares about a 2022 investigation he inherited from former Attorney General Mark Herring regarding an apartment complex in Richmond where  predominantly Latino and immigrant tenants complained of mismanagement and discrimination. When he first took office, Miyares  fired staff members that had been involved in the case and a recent FOIA request revealed that the investigation had been closed, citing “inconclusive” evidence. 
Miyares countered that his office won a discrimination case where a vacation rental home landlord evicted a family due to one of its members being Black, lauding it as the biggest victory against housing discrimination in the state’s history. 
 Higher education

The men shared thoughts about Virginia’s colleges and universities, which have been roiled this year by shifting federal standards and mandates to end diversity, equity and inclusion policies. The University of Virginia is currently deliberating a compact proposed by the Trump administration which would give the school funding in exchange for adhering to a set of operating requirements that state legislators have described as “political extortion.”
When pressed on how the attorney general should “balance academic freedom, public safety and political influence from Washington, D.C. when advising Virginia universities,” Miyares said that he is a product of Virginia universities who is committed to protecting them. He said he couldn’t outline how he advised Virginia universities in these matters due to attorney-client privilege. 
“What we know about his attorney-client privilege is that it runs straight to Donald Trump,” Jones said, noting his experience as a UVA law alumni. He promised to defend Virginia colleges and universities against federal overreach and said he has a “vested interest in making sure our higher education system remains the best in the country.” 
 Looking ahead

Amid federal workforce layoffs, an ever-shifting national landscape of health care and reproductive rights laws, and Virginia’s own economic status, the next attorney general will serve as the state’s top lawyer for constituents and counsel to the next governor. 
Miyares expressed his wish to continue serving in this role and pointed to decreased crime rates under his watch, while Jones leaned on his experience defending civil liberties and sought a chance to lead the attorney general’s office with a fresh vision for the future. Voters will choose one man for the role, with early voting underway and Election Day on Nov. 4.

Mike Dunleavy’s decision to appoint a suspended attorney to a public seat on the state’s judge-nominating board does not violate the Alaska Constitution, an Anchorage Superior Court judge ruled Wednesday.
An appeal to the Alaska Supreme Court is expected, but for the moment, it clears the way for John Wood to serve on the Alaska Judicial Council, which nominates candidates to the governor for judicial vacancies. 
“The Alaska Constitution gives the governor clear authority to appoint members to the Judicial Council — a power central to the executive’s role in our system of checks and balances. Yesterday’s decision reaffirms that authority,” said Attorney General-designee Stephen Cox in a written statement. “The court agreed with the State on every material issue, recognizing that the governor’s appointment of John Wood was both lawful and appropriate, and that Mr. Wood is fully qualified to serve. This is a complete victory for the governor’s constitutional authority — and an important win for the separation of powers and for all Alaskans who want fair, balanced representation on the Judicial Council. With his decades of public service and sound judgment, Mr. Wood will be an asset to the council’s work right away.”   
Alaskans For Fair Courts and Juneau resident Eric Forrer had alleged in separate lawsuits that picking Wood violated the Alaska Constitution. In a pair of expedited complaints, they claimed Wood’s suspended bar license made him ineligible to serve on the Judicial Council because the writers of the Alaska Constitution intended laymen, not trained lawyers, to sit in public seats.
Judge Yvonne Lamoureux disagreed with that interpretation of the constitution, declaring that Wood is not an attorney.
His license was suspended in 2000 because of a dispute over bar dues and he has not practiced law since.
“Mr. Wood is not authorized to engage in the practice of law, and has no intention of practicing law again,” Lamoureux wrote. “While Mr. Wood was an attorney 25 years ago, he is not an attorney today.”
Based upon the plain meaning of the constitutional clause establishing three non-attorney seats on the Judicial Council, and the intent of the framers of the Alaska Constitution, Lamoureux wrote, “the court concludes that Mr. Wood is eligible to serve as a non-attorney member on the council.”
The two plaintiffs had also challenged Wood’s eligibility to serve because the Alaska Constitution forbids a member of the Judicial Council from holding a “position of profit under the state,” and Wood holds a consulting contract with the Dunleavy administration.
In 1968, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled that “position of profit” means acting as an employee in “salaried nontemporary employment” and does not cover consulting contracts.  
Lamoureux, citing that case, ruled against the plaintiffs. 
She also sided with the state and against the plaintiffs in one final argument that revolved around the timing of Wood’s appointment. His predecessor’s term on the Judicial Council had expired during the spring legislative session, but Dunleavy did not appoint Wood until after the session ended. The plaintiffs argued that because of that timing, Wood could not serve until confirmed by the Legislature.
Again, Lamoureux referred to the plain language of the constitution and rejected the argument.
“The text does not reflect that the governor can only fill a vacancy which arose or first happened during the recess (after the Legislature adjourns),” she wrote.
“There is no language in the constitution limiting the ability of an appointee to begin serving upon appointment, and the legislature has expressly allowed those appointed to ‘exercise the functions, have the powers, and be charged with the duties prescribed by law for the appointed positions or membership’ pending confirmation or rejection by the legislature,” Lamoureux said.
Neither Donna Goldsmith, co-chair of Alaskans for Fair Courts, nor Jim Reeves, the group’s attorney, could be reached for comment on Thursday.
Attorney Joe Geldhof, who represented Forrer, said by phone that he was “surprised, bordering on shocked” by Lamoureux’s decision because it was pretty clear to him that the context of the constitutional framers’ discussion around public members and attorney members went beyond its plain meaning.
Someone who has been trained in law cannot act as a layman, even when no longer an attorney, Geldhof said.
“The judge’s decision here, it creates a huge potential for political intrigue and mischief, and it’s just inconsistent with the ordinary language in the constitution and the common understanding of what a lawyer was when the citizens ratified the constitution,” he said. 
While he expects to appeal, “it’ll be interesting in the meantime,” he said. “It’s going to cause chaos with the judicial council.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1135138396-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-16 21:56:46.182993

(Courtesy photo)When the remnants of Typhoon Halong hit western Alaska this week, radar showed color bands curling across meteorological maps, but people on the ground were already watching what those models could not see. On social media, especially TikTok, people were sharing their view of the storm in real time. I watched it unfold there too, seeing homes shift, rivers surge, and the water rise higher than expected. The models gave us the numbers; the stories gave us the context.
As someone who used to work for the National Weather Service in Alaska as a Social Scientist, I know how much these storms weigh on both sides of the forecast. Forecasters in the office are staring at satellite loops, wind models, and limited weather balloon data, trying to anticipate how quickly conditions are changing. People in their homes are staring out the window, watching the sky darken and the water rise. Between those two worlds, there is often a long pause, the silence between the data and the lived experience.
That pause is where Alaska loses time.
This year, the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) forced out hundreds of NWS employees through firings, buyouts and retirements, which cut deep into the nation’s forecasting backbone, including positions in Alaska. When those roles disappeared, so did some of the tools they maintained. The number of weather balloons launched, a core part of the forecasting system, has dropped in many places because of a lack of staffing and resources. Those balloons feed the models that guide nearly every forecast. Fewer launches mean fewer data points, and that could mean less clarity about what is happening above us.
But in Alaska, losing those resources does not have to mean losing awareness. We can rebuild it differently.
The next generation of weather communication can happen where people are already sharing information: online, on social media, and in the middle of the storm. During Typhoon Merbok in 2022 and again with Typhoon Halong, residents shared what they were seeing in real time through flooded roads and winds that looked stronger than predicted.
Even a cautious, ethical embrace of TikTok could help forecasters see what is happening faster than any model cycle, without crossing the boundaries that federal employees must follow.
That does not mean turning TikTok into an official data feed. It means acknowledging that people are already providing real-time observations and learning how to use those insights to improve awareness and communication. A forecaster who can see what the public sees gains a sharper sense of urgency and a more grounded understanding of impact.
In Utqiaġvik and other coastal communities, the Weather Service once built dedicated radio time into local infrastructure, creating community VHF channels where residents could offer real-time corrections when forecasts needed to reflect localized impacts. Forecasting then was grounded in place; it was published on the same land where the weather arrived. That connection between the people and the forecast has largely been lost.
But we can bring that dialogue back. Today, platforms like TikTok, Facebook, and SIKU, the Indigenous knowledge and observation network, are the new VHF radio. They are full of visual, place-based weather information, already timestamped and geolocated. The technology exists. What we need is a process to connect it to the people making weather forecasts.
Imagine if every forecasting desk had a simple system to monitor verified community feeds during major events, not as rumor tracking but as situational awareness. People are already sharing what they see; the work now is to listen, to connect those existing streams of information to the people producing the forecasts.
That kind of system would make forecasts more responsive, not just more accurate. It would also rebuild trust – something Alaska urgently needs after years of budget cuts and agency turnover. When people see their own perspectives reflected in official information, they start believing that the system is built for them, not just about them.
We cannot replace the scientists and technicians who were laid off, nor fill data gaps overnight. But we can strengthen what remains by using the tools already in our hands. The future of forecasting in Alaska will not come only from satellites and supercomputers. It will come from people, the ones standing outside during the storm, holding up a phone, showing the rest of us what is really happening.
If we start rebuilding those connections now, we might find that the best forecasting tool has always been trust.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/9361977-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-16 21:01:36.386983

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)When the last government shutdown happened at the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019, the Salt Lake City Airport was at its old location and less prepared to help out the federal workers who still had to show up for their shifts without a paycheck. 
That’s a situation that airport administrators said they promised to handle better. Thursday morning, after an appropriations approval from the Salt Lake City Council, one step of that goal was materialized with a pantry dedicated to federal staff, including agents in the Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection lines.
“Not only Salt Lakers and Utahns rely on (the workers), but people from all over the globe, because Salt Lake International Airport is more connected around the world than it’s ever been in the past,” Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said. “We need these federal employees to be well, to feel supported, to know that we’re grateful for them, and to show up to work.”

The U.S. Congress hasn’t agreed on a funding plan for the federal government, pausing some government operations and temporarily leaving federal workers without salaries.   
The airport, which Salt Lake City owns, filled a hallway of its offices with all kinds of household items, including dried and canned food, diapers, hygiene products and pet food to help relieve that pressure. Soon, the offerings will also include gift cards for gas and other needs, Bill Wyatt, director of the Salt Lake City Department of Airports, said. 
The public can also get involved, dropping off non-perishable food at a donation facility the airport is setting up at the airport’s gas station.
“There was a high level of utilization last time, and I would just say, on a personal level, a high level of gratitude,” Wyatt said. 



Let us know what you think...


 


Administrators are using airport funds to cover the cost of the pantry. While officials have spent about $6,000 in the initial effort, they asked for a $100,000 appropriation from the Salt Lake City Council.
“We don’t have yet any gift cards or gas cards. We will be including that. But with those kinds of numbers, it will go pretty fast,” Wyatt said. “If we need to, we’ll go back. We have the support of our airlines, who ultimately are paying a good part of the bill here. But if you park at the airport, if you rent a car at the airport, if you buy gas at the station out there, while you’re making your donation, you’re helping us raise the resources to do this.”  
The pantry may help about 450 TSA workers in the Salt Lake City International Airport, and about 30 from Customs and Border Protection, Wyatt said. Air traffic controllers aren’t able to accept gifts for conflict of interest reasons. 
Currently, the airport is still running smoothly, but officials worry frustrations will grow deeper among federal workers the longer the shutdown holds. 
However, other airports across the country have experienced disruptions during the shutdown, a factor that could also affect Salt Lake travelers, Wyatt said.
“It’s a problem for us, because the airspace that we all share as passengers is a national airspace, and that’s how it’s managed,” he said. “So it’s one thing to say we’re not experiencing shortages of workforce here at the moment, but it doesn’t really make any difference if the places that you’re going to are struggling.”
Mendenhall pleaded with passengers to “bring an extra dose of patience” while visiting the airport.
“Give some grace to these federal employees, share your gratitude with them. They’re showing up for the well being of every single one of us, and they’re not getting paid at this point,” she said.

Kim Reynolds spoke with reporters after a  roundtable meeting with state lawmakers and community members at the Roy R. Estle Memorial Library in Dallas Center Oct. 16, 2025. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Gov. Kim Reynolds has reiterated her goal of tackling property taxes in the 2026 legislative session, the last session before her term as governor ends.
In Dallas Center on Thursday, Reynolds held a roundtable discussion on property taxes and other issues with Dallas County community members, business and local government leaders, as well as state Reps. Carter Nordman and David Young.  While the meeting was closed to the press, the governor told reporters after the event that she and Republicans in the state legislature plan to craft legislation aimed at lowering property taxes in 2026. Reynolds, who is not seeking reelection in 2026, said this would be the final piece of years of work as governor with a Republican-controlled legislature to lower taxes.
“This year, we went to a 3.8% flat income tax,” Reynolds said. “We no longer tax pension or inheritance. We did the unemployment insurance tax last year, where we cut in half what employers are taxed on — that’ll be a $10 billion savings for employers over 10 years. So the last piece to really tackle is property taxes.”
The discussion on lowering property tax costs has come up in several recent legislative sessions. In 2023, Reynolds signed a law capping levy rates for cities and counties and providing new exemptions for property owners.
Earlier this year, House Majority Leader Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, and Sen. Dan Dawson, R-Council Bluffs, the 2025 chairs of the Ways and Means committees in the House and Senate, held multiple meetings on a property tax bill that included a repeal of Iowa’s “rollback” system, in which only a portion of  residential property value is treated as taxable. Though the proposal went through multiple iterations and committee meetings, it failed to advance in the 2025 session.
The governor did not say whether any bill she may propose in 2026 would include ending the rollback or other proposed changes. And while she did not share details on her plans, she did say “everything is on the table” as she meets with local governments, businesses and taxpayers to discuss how property taxes could be lowered.
“We’re taking what we hear at these roundtables, we’ll aggregate the information, if we start to see some consistency, some suggestions that they have, that’ll be a part of what we’ll take a look at when we … put that piece of legislation together,” Reynolds said.
Nordman, who will chair the House Ways and Means Committee beginning in 2026, said issues such as finding new “efficiencies” in local government as well as changes to the state’s Tax Increment Financing (TIF) system and the 2023 property tax law have regularly been discussed as state and local leaders meet to discuss property taxes ahead of the 2026 session.
“Ultimately, the localities are the ones who are spending the money,” Nordman said. “And so they need to be at the table, willing to look at efficiencies and see how they can cut costs within their jurisdictions.”
While previous proposed measures have focused more exclusively on residential property taxes, Nordman said leaders have also discussed changes to commercial property taxes as well. However, he emphasized “we’re not married to anything now,” and the goal of Reynolds and GOP lawmakers’ meetings is to find the best path toward lowering property tax costs for Iowans.
“I think every single legislator is at the doors listening to the biggest concern of these individuals, and it’s property taxes,” Nordman said. “So, it’s definitely a priority for us.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reynolds10.16-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-16 21:01:36.386983

(Photo courtesy of Red Trail Energy)A sustainable aviation fuel developer plans to shift its immediate investment from South Dakota to North Dakota, in part because of delays in the development of the multi-state Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline.
The company added that it still hopes to develop its South Dakota site.
Colorado-based Gevo had obtained a $1.46 billion loan through the U.S. Department of Energy to build a jet fuel plant at Lake Preston, South Dakota. Company officials told the North Dakota Monitor on Thursday that it instead will push ahead with making jet fuel at the Richardton, North Dakota, ethanol plant it bought last year. Gevo is working with the Department of Energy to transfer the loan to expand the North Dakota site.
Red Trail Energy at Richardton in 2022 became the first ethanol plant in the country to capture and store carbon dioxide, taking advantage of its location in an area with the right geology for permanent underground storage.
Gevo plans to expand the North Dakota ethanol plant, which turns corn into fuel. It would convert the ethanol into higher-value aviation fuel in a process it calls alcohol to jet. Carbon capture is a key part of making sustainable aviation fuel.
“We don’t have to share pipelines. We don’t have to wait. We’re already doing it,” CEO Pat Gruber said of carbon capture at the North Dakota site.
Company previously broke ground in SD
Gevo’s South Dakota site relied on the planned Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline to take carbon dioxide captured from ethanol plants in five states to an underground storage site in North Dakota.
But the future of that project in South Dakota is in doubt because of landowner resistance, which has contributed to two rejected Summit permit applications in South Dakota and a ban on eminent domain for carbon pipelines adopted by the Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Larry Rhoden.
North Dakota attorney general says legal action against South Dakota pipeline law not an option

In 2022, Rhoden attended and spoke at Gevo’s groundbreaking near Lake Preston, where it proposed to build its plant in South Dakota. Rhoden was lieutenant governor at the time. Then-Gov. Kristi Noem said in a press release on the day of the groundbreaking that “businesses are choosing South Dakota because we are ‘Open for Business,’ and we give them the opportunity to succeed.” The press release described the Gevo project as the “largest economic investment in South Dakota history.”
On Thursday, Rhoden’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In Iowa, where Summit is based, the company is seeking to change its pipeline permit. Summit wants to remove North Dakota as the designated end point for the pipeline.
A spokesperson for Summit said Friday the change “keeps open the option to transport CO2 west through Nebraska or north through South Dakota,” reported the Iowa Capital Dispatch.
Gruber said the jet fuel production in North Dakota would be 30 million gallons a year, half of what was planned for South Dakota. But he said the 500 acres at Richardton could allow for expansion.
He said the jet fuel plant would cost about $500 million. Gruber noted that is substantially less than $2.6 billion it planned to spend on the South Dakota site.
Gevo is hosting a meeting Monday to answer questions for farmers and others in the Richardton area. The meeting will be from 6 to 7:30 Mountain time at WIX Barn near Richardton.
ND location provides access to oil industry
Gruber said building in North Dakota also opens the door to Gevo selling its carbon to the oil industry. North Dakota oil producers could buy the carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery — pumping gas into the well to help the well produce more oil.
“This is a great opportunity for us, and we sit right next to Bakken,” Gruber said, referring to the Bakken Formation. North Dakota is the nation’s No. 3 oil producing state, with most of it coming from the Bakken.
Oil industry and state leaders have touted enhanced oil recovery as a way for North Dakota to sustain oil production for decades to come and continue to provide the state with tax revenue.
Gruber said Gevo has started discussion with oil companies, but he said the infrastructure to make enhanced oil recovery possible is still years away.
Ethanol plants are seen as a prime source for carbon dioxide because the gas is captured from the fermentation process of turning corn into ethanol instead of from the burning of fuel.
“It’s pure, concentrated CO2,” Gruber said.
Another benefit of carbon capture for Gevo is the ability to sell carbon credits to other industries with high carbon emissions. Gevo in September announced it is partnering with Biorecro North America on carbon credit sales generated at the North Dakota facility.
‘Matter of when’ with SD site
Gruber said he was grateful that the Department of Energy is working with Gevo on transferring the federal loan, though there are steps remaining to complete the process. Gevo filed a document with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday of its intent to use the loan money in North Dakota.
As for the future of the eastern South Dakota site, Gevo officials said it remains a great industrial location and will be developed.
“The are other things we can do at that site,” said Paul Bloom, Gevo’s chief business officer. “It’s a matter of when.”
But the Gevo officials said the demand for sustainable aviation fuel meant the company could not wait for the Summit pipeline. Summit had hoped to be operating in 2024 but has yet to start construction as it tries to secure all the permits it needs.
“We can’t sit around for that,” Gruber said.  “We’ve got a mission here.”

Jim Pillen. July 16, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)McCOOK, Neb. — Nebraska officials have moved out all inmates from a Nebraska state prison Gov. Jim Pillen plans to convert into an immigration detention center by the end of this month.
Jennifer Huxoll, chief of the Civil Litigation Bureau in the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office, shared that detail Thursday regarding the Work Ethic Camp in McCook. She was responding to a new lawsuit from McCook residents and a former state lawmaker seeking to stop the Nebraska-federal repurposing plan.
There were 186 inmates at the facility as of Aug. 19, when officials announced the transition plan. Pillen estimated that it would take into mid-October to repurpose the prison. He extended that timeline this week to Nov. 1.

Huxoll told Red Willow County District Judge Patrick Heng that there are multiple contracts the state has in place and other parties not yet in the courtroom, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a Lincoln-based company building a fence around the grounds.
Outback Fence, a Lincoln-based fencing company, agreed to a $750,000 contract with the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services to install a 12-foot razor-topped fence at the prison by the end of the month. Huxoll said the fence is about 90% done.
“We have necessary parties who are not present for this action who are also going to be affected by this,” Huxoll said.
Huxoll’s statement is the first to indicate the state has entered contracts on more than fencing related to the Work Ethic Camp, though it wasn’t immediately clear if one included Homeland Security or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It is also the clearest sign yet of how close the repurposing could be.
Heng asked when Nebraska would begin accepting federal detainees, to which Huxoll said: “I don’t have an official answer for you. I do know what the governor has said in his press releases.”
13 McCook residents, former lawmaker sue to stop Nebraska-ICE detention center

Nebraska Appleseed filed the lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of 13 McCook residents and former State Sen. DiAnna Schimek of Lincoln, who was among 41 senators who authorized and appropriated funds to the Work Ethic Camp in 1997. That move came at the request of McCook native and then-Gov. Ben Nelson, the state’s last Democratic governor. The prison opened in 2001. 
Under state law, the facility is meant to provide rehabilitative programming to low-risk felony offenders and to free up space in other prisons for more violent offenders.
The lawsuit argues Pillen and Rob Jeffreys, director of the Corrections Department, are seeking “usurp” legislative authority over penal institutions under the Nebraska Constitution and state law related to the use of public funds.
Nick Grandgenett, an attorney for the McCook residents and Schimek, told Heng that voters in 1958 explicitly moved prison oversight from the executive branch and a governor-appointed board to the Legislature. Grandgenett said no state law allows the executive branch to take custody of noncitizens, nor migrants facing civil deportation matters.
“At its core, this is not about immigration,” Grandgenett said Thursday. “This is about our constitutional republican form of government.”
Pillen has previously argued state law gives him authority through the creation of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, plus a clause in the Nebraska Constitution that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.”
Grandgenett urged Heng to reconsider a temporary restraining order to pause state and federal work to convert the Work Ethic Camp and preserve the “status quo.”
Heng denied the request late Wednesday and again Thursday when Grandgenett renewed the request. Instead, Heng set a hearing for 9 a.m. Oct. 24 to determine whether to grant a temporary injunction.
Said Heng: “The court’s aware that, whenever the time is, it’s a short time period between now and when the facility becomes functional.”

Dan McKee, left, and documentarian Ken Burns, right, during a press scrum at the Rhode Island State House on Thursday, Oct. 16, 2025. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Documentarian Ken Burns stood in the governor’s reception room and addressed a man who was present but could not hear him.
“Thank you, Mr. President,” Burns said.
He was talking to the painting behind him. Of all the opulent features and fixtures in the State Room of Rhode Island State House, the room orbits around Gilbert Stuart’s 1802 portrait of George Washington. 
So too does Burns’ new project, which prompted his visit to the Ocean State Thursday and was part of a multistate tour to showcase and roll out his latest behemoth of a documentary. “The American Revolution,” co-directed with Sarah Botstein and David Schmidt, is a six-episode,12-hour docuseries set to premiere nationally on PBS beginning on Sunday, Nov. 16, and airing consecutively through Friday, Nov. 21.
Rhode Island is the 17th state Burns has visited since the tour began in January 2025, in which he and Botstein have often fielded questions from students about the project it took them eight years to make. Higher schoolers and college students in the Rhode Island Civic Leadership Program, plus state leaders and media, were treated to a 15-minute sneak peek from the docuseries. Burns visited the State House ahead of a sold-out preview screening at Rhode Island College Thursday night. 
“I always make a joke that we’re gonna lock the doors and show the whole 12 hours,” Burns told the crowd.
Even in the highly truncated version the documentary shown Thursday, one could grasp the Burns style: A mix of reenactments, voiceover, and like all Burns films, a good amount of panning and zooming across still images — a trope so associated with the filmmaker that Apple’s iMovie software refers to the technique as the “Ken Burns effect.”  
The clipshow opened with a quoted passage from Thomas Paine, who described America as “a small spark” that soon became a flame inextinguishable — a revolutionary fire which, largely unlike those before it, burned in defense of inalienable rights for all people, Paine argued. 
“The centrality of women, the centrality of Native Americans, to enslaved and free Black Americans, are hugely powerful to this story and do not in any way take away from the most important person, George Washington,” Burns said.

‘Would I have been a patriot?’ 
During the screening and Q&A, students could be seen taking notes. Some were curious about filming techniques, others wanted to know about historical research.
“I’ve been doing this for almost 50 years,” Burns told students. “Only one of the films is not about American history.”
The 72-year-old filmmaker who lives in Walpole, New Hampshire, is known for his thoroughness in miniseries on topics like baseball, country music, and jazz. In each outing, Burns refused to cede any of these topics’ complexity to the tyranny of a shorter runtime. 
Also like his past documentaries, Burns has not shied away from the sinister, the cruel, and the dark in America’s revolutionary story. Burns wondered if it’s not “fear” that prevents people from acknowledging how violent the American Revolution was. 
Burns said he hopes audiences will ask themselves what they would do in the 18th century. “I hope that the series makes everyone think… ‘Would I have been a patriot? Would I be willing to fight for my beliefs? Would I be willing to die?…And I suppose, would I be able to kill someone else?’”
He gave the example of a Vermonter loyal to the crown, who was bayoneted in the ribs by his childhood friend. “That is the American Revolution, as much as it is big ideas in Philadelphia,” Burns said. 
“It’s funny, we accept the violence of the Civil War and our 20th century wars we’ve been involved in,” Burns added. “We found that by showing how bloody this revolution was…we get a better sense and that those big ideas are not, in fact, diminished. They’re actually made that much more inspiring by telling the complicated story.”
Burns added to students, “Americans were a lot more divided then than they are now.”
Botstein, who has worked with Burns for 30 years, stressed to students that the filmmakers employed as many kinds of cameras as they did narrative perspectives. 
“We shot for this film in particular with every kind of camera you can imagine — really fancy, expensive, huge feature-like cameras, [but also] Ken’s iPhone.”
The technological changeups over the years have not changed the essential process for Burns and Botstein: “You still have to make art that looks and sounds beautiful,” Botstein said.

‘The second most important general in the history of revolution’ 
In remarks to students Thursday, Gov. Dan McKee, stayed on brand and snuck in a pitch for the Department of State’s attempt to create a more dignified abode for Rhode Island’s numerous historical artifacts.
“We really do need our own history museum,” the governor said. “The more you know about our state, the prouder you will be living in it.”
Burns stressed that Rhode Island history plays a crucial role in his new film. He thanked the subject of another portrait in the room in his opening remarks to students. On the wall opposite Washington is his trusted general Nathanael Greene, who, despite an uncooperative knee and limp acquired early in his life, went on to become what Burns called “the second most important general in the history of revolution.”










We found that by showing how bloody this revolution was…we get a better sense and that those big ideas are not, in fact, diminished. They’re actually made that much more inspiring by telling the complicated story.


– Ken Burns


Rhode Island Secretary of State Gregg Amore — a former history teacher who lights up when discussing the Ocean State’s history — called Washington and Greene “the indispensable man and the indispensable man.”
Born on a farm in what is now Warwick, Greene excelled in the Revolutionary War’s southern theater. In appropriately nautical fashion for a Rhode Islander, Greene fought a river war that, in its clever command of the terrain, would probably have impressed Sun Tzu. Greene’s 1781 Race to the Dan in North Carolina moved American troops across the water in ways the British could not. A July 2007 article in Smithsonian on Greene was subtitled, “The all-but-forgotten story of the unlikely hero who ensured victory in the American Revolution,” citing his river tactics.
Burns told students that Greene “abandoned his Quaker faith because of the exigencies and the urgency of the moment, and turns out to be at almost every juncture, the person that Washington can depend on the most and rely on the most for the best kind of advice…Nathanael Greene is central to the story.”
Before the movie preview, Burns also took questions from reporters — one per news outlet — in the State Library. In the last two minutes of the press scrum, Burns fielded a reporter’s question about the relevance of the Revolutionary Period for our current understanding of the presidency. What models for executive leadership can be found in the nation’s genesis? Burns admitted he would find no trouble in dwelling on the topic at length, as he often does things “in six or nine parts.” 
But with precious little time left, the filmmaker opted instead for an emblematic case: Washington.
“At the Constitutional Convention in 1787, he’s unanimously elected president of the United States by all of the electors, and he gives up that power,” Burns recounted. 
Even King George III, who Burns described as “not a madman,” waxed lyrical on Washington’s choice to relinquish his prestige rather than cling to it.
Burns concluded, “There could be no greater executive power than to give it up.”

Matt Morawski, director of communications and external affairs for the Wayne County Airport Authority, confirmed on Tuesday that the TSA was playing the video on monitors in the space it leases at Detroit Metro Airport.
On Wednesday, the airport authority issued a statement noting that it had asked the TSA to stop playing the video. The airport authority reiterated that it does not control the checkpoint monitors within TSA-leased airport space, and that the administration did not request permission to play the message. 
The airport is also displaying signs at the entrances of TSA checkpoints that read: “The views expressed in this TSA controlled video do not represent the views of the Wayne County Airport Authority. The Wayne county airport authority does not engage in partisan politics. Thank You.”

In the video, Noem says that Democrats in government have refused to fund the federal government, noting that most TSA employees are working without pay.
“We will continue to do all that we can to avoid delays that will impact your travel,” Noem said. “And our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.”
When asked about the Wayne County Airport Authority’s request via email, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security – which oversees the TSA – responded with a statement from Assistant Secretary For Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin.

“It is TSA’s top priority to ensure that travelers have the most safe, pleasant and efficient airport experience possible,” McLaughlin said. “However, Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government, and because of this, most of our TSA employees are working without pay. While this creates challenges for our people, our security operations remain largely unimpacted at this time.”
McLaughlin added: “It’s unfortunate our workforce has been put in this position due to political gamesmanship. Our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.”
On Monday, spokespeople for Gerald R. Ford International Airport Authority and Flint Bishop International Airport confirmed they were not playing the video.
On Thursday, Heidi Groenboom, communications and events associate for the Gerald R. Ford International Airport Authority, also said that the digital screens owned by the airport authority are designated for static content offering travel information and helping travelers find their way.
Kasey Posa, director of marketing and public relations for Flint Bishop International airport, said the airport is not showcasing the video on any monitors owned or operated by the Bishop International Airport Authority.

However, Posa also said that the TSA is an independent federal agency that  manages security in leased space within airports. For this reason, the TSA has its own internal communications system and has the discretion to air federally distributed content independent of the Airport Authority.
“Because the message in the referenced video violates [Bishop International Airport Authority’s] Airport Rules and Regulations, we have requested that TSA stop playing the video,” Posa said. 
Since the shutdown began, the Trump Administration has taken to blasting Democrats through various official channels, displaying messages on several federal agencies’ websites blaming Democrats for the shutdown
However, Democrats have pushed back, noting that Republicans, as the party in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, the government shutdown is the GOP’s crisis to own. 
The Hatch Act bars federal employees from engaging in partisan political activities while on duty, and the federal government is now facing several legal challenges due to its shutdown messaging. 
Consumer advocacy watchdog Public Citizen filed legal challenges against nine government agencies, while the Center for Biological Diversity filed complaints against the U.S. Forest Service and the Department of Health and Human Services.
Democracy Defenders Fund, a nonpartisan organization focused on protecting democracy and defending the rule of law, filed two letters with the Government Accountability Office calling for an investigation into whether the U.S. Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Treasury, Agriculture, Justice, State, and Health and Human Services violated the Anti-Deficiency Act, as well as other bans against using federal funds for political propaganda.

“My mantra is, ‘trying to get as comfortable as I can with discomfort’ — because that’s a constant right now,” said Sarah Clark, Gov. Scott’s secretary of administration, on Thursday.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s fiscal leaders worry feds won’t repay the state when government reopens.","Secretary of Administration Sarah Clark speaks before the House Appropriations Committee at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Feb. 18, 2025. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
MONTPELIER — State fiscal leaders said Thursday they believe Vermont has the money to keep key federally-backed programs running, at least for now, if funding for those programs lapses because of the federal government shutdown. But they’re worried the feds might not repay the state after the fact — something that could make it harder to pay for other programs in the future.
Historically, states are reimbursed for costs incurred during a shutdown once Congress reaches a new spending deal. But President Donald Trump’s pattern since he won a second term of slashing previously-promised federal funding — and his administration’s recent targeting of money for Democratic-led states — has leaders in Vermont and other states concerned about what will happen after the impasse ends.
The Vermont Legislature’s Joint Fiscal Committee, which oversees state spending when lawmakers aren’t in session, met on Thursday, which was the 16th day of the government shutdown. Lawmakers heard from leaders in Gov. Phil Scott’s administration, Vermont’s three congressional offices and the state treasurer’s office about the impacts of the stalemate so far.
Rebecca Ellis, state director for U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., told the committee the shutdown would continue at least through the weekend, and a resolution in the near term seemed unlikely.
State leaders said federal funding is in hand to operate Vermont’s Medicaid program through the end of the year, and to operate its Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, into at least early December. 
Their more pressing concern, as of Thursday, was about whether the federal government would provide funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, which helps many households afford fuel to heat their homes. The state was also worried Thursday whether federal funding would be available starting next month for federal nutritional benefits, known in Vermont as 3SquaresVT, though officials emphasized that could change in the coming days or weeks.
“My mantra is, ‘trying to get as comfortable as I can with discomfort’ — because that’s a constant right now,” said Sarah Clark, Scott’s secretary of administration, to the committee. 
According to Mike Pieciak, the state treasurer, as of Thursday, Vermont could be facing some $30 million to $50 million in funding that the feds may not reimburse. 
That’s “very different” from the last federal government shutdown, which spanned 35 days between December 2018 and January 2019, Clark said, when the person with her job at that point would have been “much more confident that we were going to get reimbursed.” 
“So, how do we navigate that uncertainty?” she continued. “I don’t think anybody has a playbook.”
Pieciak estimated that the state has at least $700 million it could draw on to plug gaps caused by lapses in federal funding — enough to cover his office’s estimates. But the challenge, he and other leaders said, is that would put Vermont in a more precarious financial position heading into what is already expected to be a difficult state budget-building process due to increasing costs and other cuts to federal revenue.
Legislative leaders have started warning their colleagues that some existing state programs could need to be scaled back or cut during the upcoming legislative session, which starts in January.
Thursday’s discussion also comes as the Trump administration has threatened to withhold back pay from tens of thousands of federal workers who are furloughed during the shutdown after it ends — despite a 2019 law requiring payment, which Trump signed that year.
“It’s difficult dealing with an unreliable — but very important — partner in the federal government,” said Rep. Charlie Kimbell, D-Woodstock, during the meeting. “We can’t quite secede from the Union, though.”

On Wednesday, 20 attorneys general plus two governors sued the Trump EPA for canceling a national initiative to promote solar energy.

Vermont joined a lawsuit directed at the Trump administration on Wednesday for abruptly cutting $7 billion in federal funding for nationwide solar energy projects.
The complaint joins together a coalition of 20 states from Arizona to Maine, including Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark. The complaint, filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, targets the Environmental Protection Agency’s cancellation of the Solar for All program under EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.
The state was first notified that their grant would be terminated in a letter from the agency on Aug. 7. The next day, Zeldin posted a video that said his agency “no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.” He called Solar for All a “grift,” with 15% of programmatic costs going toward “middle men taking their own cut.”
A week later, on Aug. 13, the EPA suspended Vermont’s account, which included more than $62 million in federal funds. By Sept. 19, the account was “liquidated,” and more than 90% of the funds were drained, according to the attorney general’s office.
The program was designed to pass on solar benefits to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the federal office that administered the grant to 49 states and six tribes, among others.
“In keeping with a longstanding practice, EPA does not comment on pending litigation,” the agency’s press office said in an email Thursday.
The White House declined to comment.
The program was part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, $27 billion that aimed to reduce carbon emissions and was repealed under President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill on July 4. The Solar for All page on the Environmental Protection Agency’s website has since been replaced with a quote from Zeldin that claims cutting federal programs would reduce “frivolous” spending “in the name of ‘climate equity.’”
Vermont’s congressional delegation championed the initiative, including U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who introduced Solar for All into the Inflation Reduction Act. The 2022 act, under the Biden administration, channeled hundreds of billions of dollars toward the clean energy transition. Much of those programs have since been defunded by the Trump administration.
“I introduced the Solar for All program to slash electric bills for working families by up to 80% — putting money back in the pockets of ordinary Americans, not fossil fuel billionaires,” Sanders said in the attorney general’s Thursday press release. “Donald Trump wants to illegally kill this program to protect the obscene profits of his friends in the oil and gas industry.”
Last year, Vermont received $62.5 million from the federal program through the Vermont Department of Public Service. Funds were temporarily frozen in February, but in May, Vermont had allocated more than $22 million of the state’s total grant to help install solar panels on low-income housing through the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, a quasi-public entity that acts like a bank for affordable housing.

At that point, the state had spent roughly $150,000 on staffing that was billed to the agency on a month-by-month reimbursement basis, Melissa Bailey, director of the state energy office within the Vermont Department of Public Service, previously said.
Kerrick Johnson, the department’s commissioner, said he hoped the funding for the program could be restored.
“Thousands of Vermonters stand to benefit if we can get this done,” Johnson wrote in an email.
The state expected to serve about 8,300 low-income households, reduce electric bills by at least 20% and create about 300 new jobs, according to the release.
In May, Sanders said that Trump’s budget bill that canceled the program could not legally rescind the funds. 
“Vermont has an agreement with the EPA for this money, and the Trump Administration cannot go back on this deal,” Clark said in the release.

Brad Little and U.S. Senator for Idaho Jim Risch were caught by surprise Friday when U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a deal with Qatar for a training facility at Mountain Home Air Force Base, records show. 
Risch also serves as chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
The deal would involve new permanent training facilities for Qatari troops to fly F-15QA aircraft at the base.
A text message from Risch’s Chief of Staff Ryan White to Little’s Chief of Staff Zach Hauge included a post about the announcement and said, “this was news to us,” to which Hague responded, “same,” according to public records obtained by the Idaho Capital Sun.  
A spokesperson for the governor’s office confirmed Thursday in an email that Little’s office was not made aware of the announcement beforehand. 
Hague wrote that “Brass at (Mountain Home Air Force Base) was also unaware.” A spokesperson for the Mountain Home base could not immediately be reached for comment. 
When Hague asked via text message if Risch’s office planned to respond, White said, “My boss is in the air, I’d prefer not.” 
Risch’s office did not respond to multiple comment requests by the Sun made between the announcement Friday and Wednesday. He told the Spokesman-Review in a statement late Tuesday that the move “is in line with other preexisting U.S. military agreements with important allies like Singapore, which has been hosted at the base for years.” 
Little’s office also did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the facility announcement until Wednesday, when his office provided a statement from Little that said, “Secretary (Pete) Hegseth confirmed that Qatar is not building a military base in Idaho. I am in communication with Idaho’s congressional delegation and the Trump administration to ensure Idahoans’ concerns are raised. It is critical we work with the administration to ensure this agreement is done in a way that protects Idahoans’ interests as further details are finalized.”
 U.S. Department of Defense sent talking points to Idaho military officials after announcement

On Friday afternoon, a public affairs officer for the Air Force’s 366th Fighter Wing, which is housed at the Mountain Home base, sent several Air Force officials talking points from the U.S. Department of Defense — which President Donald Trump through an executive order has said is now called the “Department of War.” The name change requires congressional approval to become permanent.  
“The Department of War is proud of our military partnership w/ Qatar, including today’s announcement on cooperation around F-15QAaircraft,” the email said. “While we are cooperating — to be clear — Qatar will not have their own base in the United States, or anything like a base. Today we simply announced a partnership — on a U.S. controlled base only — much like we have with  many other countries.” 
The talking points include answers to potential questions about the deal, such as about construction, training and costs. 
If concerns about costs were raised, the talking point included, “We are actively working with our Qatari partners to finalize the cost associated with facilities construction to support the Qatari F-15 fleet at Mountain Home Air Force Base, with the goal of concluding these details over the coming weeks.” 
The email also noted the underlying case cleared congressional review in April and included a link to the 2022 environmental impact statement regarding the proposed facility at the Mountain Home base. Work began on the assessment in 2020, the Associated Press reported. 
The agreement to sell the fighter jets to Qatar was announced in 2017, the AP reported. 
 Risch’s office later provided governor’s office with additional talking points

Risch’s Press Secretary Madison Hardy on Wednesday morning emailed Little’s communication staff with background information and talking points regarding the facility. 
The email includes clarification that Qatar would not build a military base in Idaho and that “Military equipment sales and training agreements with allied foreign countries are standard practice under any administration.” 
Hardy wrote that, “Senator Risch and the entire Idaho Congressional Delegation are in communication with the Trump administration to ensure the proper safeguards are in place and that the concerns of Idahoans, which they share, are addressed.” 
The email also noted that Mountain Home’s base already hosts troops from Singapore to train them to use F-15s, and that the Mountain Home base will retain full control and ownership of the facilities.

(Sue Dorfman for Votebeat)
As the 2025 municipal election approaches, Pennsylvanians have until 5 p.m. Monday to register to vote.
“For the many eligible Pennsylvanians who have yet to register to vote, it’s not too late to do so,” Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt said last week. “I encourage any eligible Pennsylvanian who is not registered to visit vote.pa.gov, register, and avoid missing out on the opportunity to have their voices heard in this important election.”
What big races are on the ballot?
There are a few races with statewide implications on the ballot this November.
Garnering the most attention are the retention races of Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justices Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty and David Wecht. Those three were elected to a 10-year term as Democrats in 2015.
Under the Pennsylvania Constitution judges run for election in partisan competitive partisan races. They don’t have to run for reelection against challengers, but rather face voters in a “yes” or “no” referendum on whether they should be retained for subsequent terms.
There are also vacancies on the state’s Superior and Commonwealth courts.
Democrat Stella Tsai, a Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas judge, is facing Republican Matt Wolford, an Erie-based environmental attorney, in the race to fill a vacancy on the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court.
Vying for an open seat on the state’s Superior Court are Brandon Neuman, a Democrat who serves as Washington County Court of Common Pleas judge; Maria Battista, a Republican who is the president of a consulting firm, and Daniel Wassmer, an attorney who is running under the Liberal Party banner.
Local elections are also taking place up and down the ballot across the commonwealth, including the race for Philadelphia district attorney, and the mayor of several of the state’s biggest cities including Pittsburgh, Allentown, and Scranton.
Republicans continue to narrow voter registration gap in Pennsylvania
Continuing the trend of the past few years, Democrats will likely enter this upcoming election with a more narrow voter registration advantage than the previous election.
According to data from Pennsylvania Department of State (DOS), as of Oct. 13, there are 167,715 more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania.
During the 2025 primary election a few months ago, Democrats held a 178,070 voter registration advantage. For the 2024 general election, there were 286,283 more registered Democrats than Republicans in the state. In Nov. 2023, the last time Pennsylvania voters had a decision to make for a statewide judicial election, there were 446,566 more voters registered with the Democratic Party over the Republican Party. 
Who can vote?
According to DOS, the requirements to vote include being a U.S. citizen and Pennsylvania resident for at least 30 days before the election and being at least 18 years old on the day of the election.
Schmidt notes that using the Online Voter Registration (OVR) system is a “fast and convenient” way to register to vote, although it is not the only way eligible voters can register to vote by mail or apply in person.
Those interested can also register to vote at the following locations: 

a county voter registration office,  
county assistance offices,  
Women, Infants & Children (WIC) program offices, 
Armed Forces recruitment centers, 
county clerk of orphans’ courts or marriage license offices, 
area agencies on aging, 
county mental health and intellectual disabilities offices, 
student disability services offices of the State System of Higher Education, 
offices of special education in high schools, 
Americans with Disabilities Act-mandated complementary paratransit providers, and
Department of Transportation (PennDOT) driver and photo license centers.

Although Oct. 20 is the final day to register to vote for the 2025 election in Pennsylvania, voters have until Oct. 28 to apply for a mail ballot. Those ballots must be received by the county election offices by 8 p.m. on Election Day, according to the DOS.

,DC,2025-10-16 22:43:08+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump critic and former aide John Bolton indicted for mishandling classified documents,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-critic-and-former-aide-john-bolton-indicted-mishandling-classified-documents,,"A federal grand jury indicted former National Security Advisor John Bolton, a one-time staffer to President Donald Trump who turned publicly against the president by the end of his first term, on charges he mishandled classified information.The 18-count indictment in district court in Maryland accuses Bolton of wrongfully storing and sharing classified documents.“Bolton abused his position as National Security Advisor by sharing more than a thousand pages of information about his day-to-day activities as the National Security Advisor—including information relating to the national defense which was classified up to the TOP SECRET/SCI level—with two unauthorized individuals,” the indictment reads.Both unauthorized individuals were related to Bolton. One also lived, as Bolton does, in Montgomery County, Maryland.According to the indictment, Bolton would write near-daily “diary-like” emails to the pair from a commercial email account, hosted on AOL and Google, describing his day-to-day activities as national security advisor, apparently taking them from private notes and rewriting them into a word processor, the indictment said.The communications contained classified information that the pair was not authorized to receive, and was transmitted through web services that were not authorized to host them, according to the indictment.And the use of a commercial email server increased the chances of a cyber attack, which eventually happened in July 2021.A hacker believed to be associated with the government of Iran hacked Bolton’s private email, the indictment said.“A representative for Bolton notified the U.S. Government of the hack in or about July 2021, but did not tell the U.S. Government that the account contained national defense information, including classified information,” the indictment said.Raid on Bolton home in MarylandFBI agents raided Bolton’s home earlier this year, leading to speculation that charges were coming.According to the indictment, Bolton had printed out and stored much of the correspondence he had sent to relatives while in the White House.The documents Bolton is accused of sharing were redacted from in the indictment. His misconduct is alleged from early in his time as national security advisor in April 2018 to August 2025.After campaigning against “lawfare” — the targeting of political opponents through the legal system — Trump has encouraged prosecutions of several rivals, including Bolton. Trump’s Justice Department has also won indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Leticia James. Wednesday, Trump called for investigations into U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, and former DOJ special prosecutor Jack Smith.In a Thursday statement, U.S. Justice Department officials sought to rebut any accusations the investigation was politically charged.“There is one tier of justice for all Americans,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. “Anyone who abuses a position of power and jeopardizes our national security will be held accountable. No one is above the law.” FBI Director Kash Patel said the indictment was secured through “meticulous work from dedicated career professionals at the FBI who followed the facts without fear or favor. Weaponization of justice will not be tolerated, and this FBI will stop at nothing to bring to justice anyone who threatens our national security.”",,,,2025-10-16 19:04:52.993693

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Revenue Estimating Conference on Thursday lowered its estimates for the state’s tax revenue in fiscal year 2026 by $375 million compared to predictions from March of this year.
The panel, chaired by Iowa Department of Management Director Kraig Paulsen, made changes to the revenue estimates in light of recent economic shifts and tax policy changes like the federal “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency reported the state’s revenue in fiscal year 2025 was $198 million below the panel’s March forecast because of the impact of federal tax law changes.
Paulsen said the new REC estimates account for both the reduced state revenue due to federal tax policies, the impacts of the state’s 2024 acceleration of previously approved income tax cuts, as well as economic factors like rising unemployment rates and China’s move to import soybeans from South American countries instead of U.S. producers.

The state revenue is forecast to decline by 9% in FY 2026, more than the March forecast’s 4.8% estimated decrease. This lowers the predicted state revenue from $8.5 billion in the current fiscal year to a projected $8.1 billion.
Iowa lawmakers and Gov. Kim Reynolds approved a $9.4 billion budget this year, meaning the new projections have increased the expected gap between the state’s income and spending to $1.3 billion. Republican leaders have repeatedly said they were planning to take money from the Taxpayer Relief Fund and the state surplus to finance income tax cuts. Paulsen said the state has roughly $6 billion in the Taxpayer Relief Fund and other reserves that will be used to weather expected revenue decreases.
Paulsen said GOP leadership sees the state revenue change as allowing Iowans to keep more money through collecting less in income taxes.
“This reduction in revenue also does not mean the state is in a poor economic condition, but that revenue previously being collected by the state, once again, is being left in the pockets of hardworking Iowans,” Paulsen said. “Obviously, we are not in a period of state’s most robust growth, but we do continue to see to see growth.”
But Democratic state leaders said the latest REC figures show Republican budgeting practices will lead to financial struggles for the state government in future years. Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, criticized GOP leaders for drawing from one-time funding through the state’s reserves for initiatives like the income tax cuts and Education Savings Account program, providing public funding for private school tuition and associated costs, while not providing more funding for public education.
“Statehouse Republicans created a billion-dollar budget deficit with their corporate tax cuts and private school vouchers,” Petersen said in a news conference. “This isn’t just a dip in revenues. This is a historic drop. The majority’s plan is to bleed our reserves dry to pay for their giveaways. The billion-dollar hole they created in the state budget is ongoing, but our reserve funds aren’t.”
Paulsen and the two other members of the panel said though they are predicting further drops in revenue in FY 2026 during a time when the state is already drawing on reserve funds, they believe Iowa is still in a strong financial position entering FY 2027 and future years.
Paulsen said he still believes revenue will rebound in future years, though Jennifer Acton, right, director of the LSA Fiscal Services division, said this prediction may be sidetracked if an economic recession occurs.
“Since the largest impact to the state income tax rate will materialize in FY 2026, we would anticipate seeing average general fund revenues begin to stabilize and increase starting in FY 2027, absent an economic downturn,” Acton said.
Paulsen said “based on what we know today,” the REC was not anticipating a recession on the horizon, but said he believes the state is in a sound fiscal place for fiscal years 2026 and 2027.
“Is this where we want to be? Is the most comfortable spot? No,” Paulsen told reporters. “But we’re in a really good spot, and … the state of Iowa is in a good financial condition.”
Rep. Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said lawmakers had “intentionally” chosen to allow the state budget to exceed state revenues by passing the income tax cuts “because Iowans were desperate for immediate relief from former President Biden’s failed economic policies” and because the state had reserves to make up for the drop.
“Despite a mixed economic picture locally and nationally, Iowa remains in a strong financial position,” Mohr said in a statement. “We have over $6 billion in cash on hand, and our reserve funds are at their statutory maximums. Iowa is in a better position than most states to handle economic uncertainties due to Iowa Republicans’ responsible budgeting over the past decade.”
The governor also released a statement saying Iowa was in a “strong financial position,” and that the changes to projected revenues were largely because of the federal budget reconciliation bill.
“Iowa’s strong fiscal health is due to a strong commitment to fiscal conservatism by my administration and legislative leadership, and we will continue to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars,” Reynolds said.
The REC meets again in December, when it will make the official revenue estimate to be used in the 2026 legislative session.

Clay Higgins is not amused. Donning a pair of tinted glasses, a Bluetooth earpiece and an “Israel Defense Forces” baseball hat, the congressman stands on a strip of grass next to the Coulee Ile des Cannes detention ponds near Judice, recording one of his signature selfie-style videos.
The subject of his ire that day? The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
“The Corps of Engineers no longer serves our republic,” Higgins tells his followers, before launching a fusillade of criticism at the Corps’ work over the past two decades.
Higgins has reason to be mad. Four years ago, in 2021, he secured a major win for those who see dredging the Vermilion River as the answer to Lafayette’s flooding woes. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had $50 million in its work plan to dredge the river. To date, Higgins laments, none of that money has been spent on dredging.
Dredging the Vermilion has been a focus of some Lafayette residents when it comes to flood prevention over the past decade. And to date, the cause hasn’t led to much action, apart from some river cleanup and maintenance by Lafayette Consolidated Government during the Josh Guillory administration.

Residents like Dave Dixon, a retired engineer who co-founded and now serves as president of the board of Dredge the Vermilion, a nonprofit founded in response to the 2016 floods that saw the river breach its banks and flood adjacent homes. Some 5,000 total homes were flooded during the historic event.
The flooding, Dixon and others say, can in part be attributed to a lack of river maintenance since the 1950s, pointing to limited flooding in the latter half of the past century that has worsened over time. The Corps has not dredged the Vermilion River in 20 years, with sections in the city averaging three to four feet in depth.
“The river can’t handle the volume of water we’re trying to send to the river right now,” Dixon told the Lafayette City Council in July, part of a refrain he has been echoing in meetings across the state. He often likens the river to a “heart patient” with clogged arteries.
But scientists and the Corps have questioned whether dredging the river would make a significant impact on flood risk across the city and parish.
“A watershed-centered approach, instead of a riverine-centered approach, is needed for flood management,” concluded a 2021 study of river dredging co-authored by UL professor Emad Habib, and based on models of the river and watershed, which would encompass all areas from and in which water collects during storm events.
The Corps itself determined a full-scale dredging of the river from Vermilion Bay would be too costly and do too little justify, an analysis that at one time spurred Higgins to determine dredging was not “the silver bullet that we thought it would be.”
The studies align much more with what Lafayette flood maps tell the naked eye.

The maps show that the high-risk areas around the river are very narrow, while vast flood zones in the city and parish have little direct relationship to the river.
In Lafayette’s Downtown, several businesses have flooded four times since 2019 alone; the flooding is often already in storefronts before the river’s flood stage rises. The city is pitching a plan to divert floodwater from where it overflows on Lee Avenue to under Johnston Street, but that project is not slated to start until late 2026.
Development throughout Lafayette Parish has also contributed to the increased runoff threatening to overwhelm even a deeper Vermilion, Habib’s study points out. Between 2001 and 2021, in Lafayette Parish, nearly 50% of housing development occurred in areas within the 500-year floodplain.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

While the river does influence flood risk in the watershed, it’s not the primary cause of flooding in Lafayette Parish. But many of the city’s most valuable private properties are located along the river, contributing heavily towards the $200 million in flood insurance claims across the parish from the 2016 floods.
Even some river residents and dredging advocates have come to the conclusion that dredging alone won’t be the answer to Lafayette’s flooding problems.
“The name of the organization is Dredge the Vermilion, and that is a very small part of the solution,” says Jeremiah Supple, a river resident and member of the advocacy group.
Instead, Supple points out, collective decision-making and improved communication among municipalities would likely provide for more effective flood mitigation. The group even went as far as to draw up a plan for the entire watershed.
“What I found interesting is all the parishes that are involved in the watershed all impact each other, and everything one parish does impacts the other, even though they all act independently of one another,” Supple says.
The conclusion that dredging the Vermilion will only be a small part of the solution raises questions about whether spending $50 million in federal dollars on it is worth pursuing, given the scope of the problem across the parish.
Higgins seems to think so. In social media and Congress, the representative has derided the Corps for its inaction and even called for it to be dissolved in response, calling out its “thick bureaucracy” as standing in the way of “protecting lives and property.”
The Corps told The Current its availability to engage with media was limited due to the federal government’s shutdown, but said it was currently working with nonfederal partners to identify and acquire dredge material disposal sites, an effort that includes obtaining environmental clearances.
“Our current target to advance dredging operations is the 2026 fiscal year,” a spokesperson for the Corps told The Current in an email. The project, the spokesperson noted, is authorized for both navigation and flood risk management purposes.
Meanwhile, Higgins has called for the agency’s dissolution on both social media and the U.S. House of Representatives floor. He’s made a broader case for shuttering federal agencies, and transferring their authorities and obligations over functions like emergency response and water management to state governments.
“These projects should be 100% turned over to the sovereign States and local government partners,” he wrote on X earlier this month. “I intend to force this debate into the House of We the People, and to the attention of our President.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TG8_9961-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-16 19:04:52.993693

(Photo: Jesse Pluim/U.S. Bureau of Land Management)Environmental groups are preparing to sue the federal government for approving a mining exploration project near the Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge, a desert wetland that supports a trove of endangered and threatened species found nowhere else in the world.
On Thursday, attorneys for the Center for Biological Diversity and the Amargosa Conservancy filed a formal notice of intent to sue the Bureau of Land Management over the project, accusing the agency of violating the Endangered Species Act.
In July, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) greenlit a proposal by the St. Cloud Mining Company to drill dozens of boreholes in an area of critical environmental concern just north of the Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge in the company’s search for clinoptilolite – a clay-like mineral used in water filtration, odor control, and soil conditioner.
Despite the project’s location, federal land managers concluded the project would have “no significant impact” on the environment and did not require a more in-depth environmental analysis before being approved.
Under the proposed plan, the mining company would drill as many as 43 boreholes up to 200 feet deep across less than one acre of public land adjacent to the company’s existing mine located about one mile south of the Nevada state line in Inyo, California.
St. Cloud Mining, who’s existing mine was approved in 1987, did not respond to a request for comment.
In the notice, the conservation groups say federal land managers violated the Endangered Species Act by approving the project without consulting the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who are responsible for ensuring developments don’t jeopardize the survival of listed endangered or threatened species or damage their designated critical habitat.
Conservation groups say the mining exploration project could potentially harm several federally listed endangered and threatened plants that rely on groundwater-fed springs in the area, including the Amargosa niterwort, the Ashe Meadows gumplant, and the spring-loving centaury.
All three plants are also listed as “fully protected species declared to be threatened with extinction,” by the Nevada Division of Forestry.
“The Ash Meadows Mine threatens the groundwater that sustains dozens of imperiled species and one of the crown jewels of our public lands, Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge,” said Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “The BLM’s job is to protect biodiversity when permitting mining exploration. It can’t dodge the Endangered Species Act and we’ll go to court to make sure it follows the law.”
Federal hydrologists acknowledged that groundwater at the site of the proposed project was relatively shallow, making it likely that boreholes drilled beyond 100 feet would hit groundwater in the area.
The BLM also acknowledged that groundwater connectivity for the area is not well understood, and it was possible the proposed project could affect groundwater downstream from the Amargosa River if drilling reached groundwater and was left unplugged.
Hitting an aquifer in the region could potentially damage groundwater dependent springs if large volumes of that groundwater burst above ground due to high pressure, creating an uncontrolled water flow that can be difficult or even impossible to stop.
Still, federal hydrologists maintained it was unlikely the project would hit a pressurized water zone, adding that the risk of creating an uncontrolled water flow was low. 
Any alterations to the flow of the “groundwater aquifer could have catastrophic consequences on the Listed Plants,” the notice says. 
“All three rely on sustained supplies of shallow groundwater keeping their habitats wetted. Any change to discharge, decrease in groundwater levels, or other perturbations in the aquifer system could dry up habitats for the Listed Plants, including adversely modifying their critical habitats,” the notice continues. 
Since the U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved the project in July – noting the project was in line with President Donald Trump’s executive order to boost domestic mineral production – several rural counties have urged the BLM to deny the project.
Nevada’s Nye County Board of Commissioners, along with the towns of Beatty and Amargosa Valley, warned that it could threaten the refuge and Nevada’s water resources.
While the proposed projects falls outside of Nye County’s jurisdictional boundaries, elected officials said they were concerned hydrologic impacts could directly affect “Nye County’s water resources and groundwater-dependent communities.”
“Exploratory drilling and mining operations occurring downstream of the refuge pose significant risks to these fragile groundwater-dependent ecosystems. Penetration of the water table during drilling could induce dewatering, disrupt spring discharge, and irreversibly damage the aquifer,” reads a September letter.
Exploration is typically the least environmentally damaging stage of mining, but even shallow drilling in the Amargosa Basin groundwater system can puncture an aquifer, which has resulted in changes to groundwater and surface water in the past.
One example is Borehole Spring in Inyo County, California. In 1967, a mining company drilled the exploratory borehole which punctured an aquifer at a depth of 350 feet. Several attempts to plug the well failed, and the leak diverted water flow from several natural springs, substantially reducing water flow. 
The exploratory drilling operations will require somewhere between 20,000 – 40,000 gallons of water for the project. According to the operation plan, the water used will be trucked in from either Longstreet Inn in Amargosa Valley or Wolfenstein Construction in Pahrump.
Mason Voehl, the executive director of the Amargosa Conservancy, said he’s confident locals can replicate the successful campaign that held back a previous attempt by a lithium company from completing an exploratory mining project in the area nearly two years ago. 
“The Amargosa Basin is one of the most sensitive hydrological systems in the country,” Voehl said. “A broad and powerful coalition rose up once to save Ash Meadows, and now we’re mobilizing again. The Amargosa is too special to take shortcuts on permitting.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Amargosa_River-cr-Jesse-Pluim-BLM-1024x674.jpg,,,2025-10-16 19:04:52.993693

Angie Craig raised $2.2 million in the third quarter for her Senate primary campaign against Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, who brought in around $914,000 over the same period. 
Ten months out from the primary, campaign finance reports released Wednesday show Craig has nearly $3 million in cash on hand to Flanagan’s $836,000. 
To date, Craig has been her own biggest donor, transferring more than $650,000 from her House campaign to her Senate campaign. She’s also received more than $100,000 from Majority Fund, a political action committee affiliated with Majority Democrats, a group of centrists aiming to remake the party’s image in the wake of Donald Trump’s election. 
No other individual donor or PAC has contributed more than $14,000 to Craig’s Senate primary; 92% of donations were less than $100, according to the campaign. 
Flanagan, who has said she will not accept donations from corporate PACs, is relying heavily on small-dollar donors. The average contribution to her campaign was $29, and 98% of donations were under $100, according to her campaign. Many of her largest donations have come from Native American tribes around the country — if elected, Flanagan would be the first Native woman in the Senate.
The highest-profile Republican in the race, Royce White, raised a fraction of the two Democratic candidates: $94,000. White is a former professional basketball player and self-described antisemite who unexpectedly won the GOP nomination and primary for Senate in 2024, when he lost by 16 points to Sen. Amy Klobuchar.

,DC,2025-10-16 22:29:22+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"US House Dems slam Trump moves to quash public demonstrations, dissent",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-dems-slam-trump-moves-quash-public-demonstrations-dissent,,"WASHINGTON — House Democrats demanded Thursday that President Donald Trump rescind two ominous directives they say target protest and dissent in the United States, including directing federal law enforcement resources to investigate groups that are “anti-American” and “anti-Christian.”In a letter to the White House the lawmakers sharply criticize a “complete and utter lack of any legal basis” for Trump’s Sept. 22 executive order “Designating Antifa as a Domestic Terrorism Organization” and his Sept. 25 memo directing federal law enforcement to investigate and disrupt a wide range of activities by groups or individuals with a vast array of beliefs.“While protecting public safety and countering genuine threats are essential responsibilities of government, the sweeping language and broad authority in these directives pose serious constitutional, statutory, and civil liberties risks, especially if used to target political dissent, protest, or ideological speech,” states the letter led by Democratic Reps. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, Jared Huffman of California and Pramila Jayapal of Washington. The letter comes just two days ahead of thousands of nationwide demonstrations, dubbed “No Kings Day,” against the activities of the Trump administration, including the deployment of federal law enforcement and National Guard troops in major American cities.“Regardless of whether the President agrees with someone’s political views, the Constitution guarantees their right to speak and assemble peacefully. Officials must not label individuals as ‘supporting Antifa’ or ‘coordinating with Antifa’ based solely on their protected speech,” according to the letter. “Antifa” is not one group. Rather, it’s an ideology that disapproves of the fascist style of governance.The letter continues: “In fact, neither the memo nor the executive order clearly defines ‘Antifa’ as a specific entity. Instead, the executive order conflates nonviolent protest and activism with doxing and violent behavior. Without clear definitions and limits, this vague framing could subject lawful political expression and assembly to the same treatment as terrorism.”Twenty-eight other Democratic lawmakers signed alongside Pocan, co-chair of the Congressional Equity and Labor caucuses; Jayapal, former head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus; and Huffman, founder of the Congressional Freethought caucus.Trump memoTrump’s Sept. 25 national security memo orders the National Joint Terrorism Task Force and its local offices to create a comprehensive national strategy to not only disrupt and prosecute political violence but also to investigate funders and employees of organizations “that aid and abet” those who commit violence or who are “recruiting and radicalizing” people to do so. There are about 200 such task forces in the U.S., including at least one in each Federal Bureau of Investigation’s 56 field offices and the rest in local, state and other federal agencies, according to the FBI.The memo states that “Common threads animating this violent conduct include anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.”Such conduct, according to the memo, is organized “through a variety of fora, including anonymous chat forums, in-person meetings, social media, and even educational institutions” and then escalates “to organized doxing.”The directive also instructs Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, who also happens to be Bessent after Trump fired his original pick two months into the job, to be on the lookout for suspect funding streams and ensure no tax-exempt entities “directly or indirectly” finance political violence or domestic terrorism. ‘Fever dream of conspiracies’The memo does not create any new parts of the criminal code or grant any new powers to federal law enforcement, including the FBI and agents who work in the criminal investigations units at the Department of Treasury and IRS.The American Civil Liberties Union described the memo as “a fever dream of conspiracies, outright falsehoods, and the president’s distorted equation of criticism of his policies by real or perceived political opponents with ‘criminal and terroristic conspiracies.’”“Through the memo, the president instructs federal departments and law enforcement agencies to use authorities they already have and focus them on investigations of civil society groups — including nonprofits, activists, and donors — to ‘disrupt’ and ‘prevent’ the president’s fever-dream version of ‘terrorism’ and ‘political violence,’” the ACLU’s Hina Shamsi wrote in an Oct. 15 article posted on the organization’s website.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",,,,2025-10-16 19:04:52.993693

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton was charged Thursday by a federal grand jury in Maryland with transmitting and illegally storing classified information.
Bolton, 76, faces 18 counts – 10 for unlawful retention of national defense information and another eight for transmitting the information. Bolton, a Bethesda resident, was charged in U.S. District Court for Maryland, after the FBI raided his Montgomery County home and Washington office in August.
“Keeping Americans safe always has been, and always will be, the top priority for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland,” said U.S. Attorney for Maryland Kelly O. Hayes, who was appointed to the job this year. “If anyone endangers our national security, we’re committed to holding them accountable.”
The Bolton indictment is just the latest filed against a Trump enemy: Former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by Trump in his first term, was indicted in September on charges that he lied to Congress during its Trump-Russia probe, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office successfully brought fraud charges against the Trump Organization in 2022, was indicted earlier this month with fraud for statements she made in a mortgage application to buy a second house in Norfolk, Virginia.
Both of those indictments were returned in the Eastern District of Virginia, where U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert resigned shortly before Comey’s indictment.

Bolton served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration in 2005 and 2006, and was Trump’s national security adviser from 2018 to 2019.
But Bolton, an important member of the Bush administration national security team that favored active military involvement in the Middle East, has since emerged as a chief Republican foreign policy critic of Trump. He wrote a 2020 book that blasted the president and widened the public rift between the two men.
The first Trump administration launched an investigation to determine if Bolton improperly used sensitive information in his book. The current search involves federal officials investigating Bolton’s actions over the last four years, according to the New York Times, which cited a federal law enforcement official.
Earlier this year, the president revoked the security detail for Bolton.
When informed of the indictment during an Oval Office event Thursday afternoon, Trump said he had not seen the indictment and was not even aware it had been returned. But he welcomed charges against Bolton, whom he called “a bad guy.”
“I didn’t know that, you’re telling me for the first time, but I think he’s a bad person,” Trump said in response to a reporter’s question.
According to a statement from Hayes’ office, Bolton used his personal email and messaging apps to transmit send sensitive documents, some classified as high as Top Secret, that prosecutors said revealed intelligence about future attacks, foreign adversaries and foreign policy. The indictment alleges that Bolton illegally kept the documents at his home, according to the news release.
The 18 charges carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison each, if convicted, Hayes office said.
“There is one tier of justice for all Americans,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement on Bolton’s indictment Thursday. “Anyone who abuses a position of power and jeopardizes our national security will be held accountable. No one is above the law.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/John-Bolton-Donald-Trump-700x477-1.jpg,,,2025-10-16 19:04:52.993693

Salesianum and Appoquinimink enter the game atop the district one standings with a win apiece against district foes.
 
Salesianum will travel to Middletown, Delaware, for its second district game of the season against the Appoquinimink Jaguars on Friday.
Sallies enters the game with a three game winning streak that began with their win over Sussex Central at the end of September. In all of Sallies’ four wins this season, they’ve scored over 30 points and in three of those victories they’ve held their opponents under ten points.
Appoquinimink enters the game with a similar three game winning streak including a road victory against Caravel last Friday. The Jaguars only loss this season came in their third game, losing a one score game to Howard at home. 
The two teams boast a strong offense to complement a stout defense. The Jaguars are averaging over 35 points per game, but Sallies sits right behind them averaging 33. Sallies allows an average of 14 points per game to opposing offenses compared to Appoquinimink’s 16.7 opponents points per game. 
Salesianum won the past two meetings between the teams earning both a win at home and on the road the past two seasons. Appoquinimink’s last win against Sallies was in 2022 when the Jaguars scored 22 points in the fourth quarter to end their regular season with a win.

(Photo courtesy of Iowa DNR) The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship announced Thursday it was beginning construction on eight abandoned mine land reconstruction projects in southeast Iowa. 
Prior to federal reclamation laws in 1977, coal mines across the country, and in Iowa, were not required to remove hazards or stabilize the mined land after closing. This left thousands of acres of land with acidic soils, dangerous piles, embankments and other conditions that are inhospitable to a native ecosystem. 
IDALS, using funding from the U.S. Department of the Interior, has cleaned up and reclaimed more than 120 abandoned coal mine sites in the state, and is constructing or designing 22 additional sites.

Iowa’s abandoned mine reclamation program is viewed nationally as a leader for its innovation in such projects. Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the projects are a result of private and public partnerships and reflect Iowa’s “ongoing investment in conservation.”
Naig said the reclamation sites are a “visible sign of progress, producing cleaner water, healthier soil, and safer land for future generations.” 
“These AML (abandoned mine land) projects reduce hazards, improve wildlife habitat and create new opportunities for agriculture, conservation and recreation in Iowa,” Naig said. 
The eight new projects represent more than $5 million in combined investments and are expected to be completed by the end of 2026, according to the press release. 
Each land reclamation project site is different. Of the eight newly announced projects, one is as small as three acres, while the largest stretches 99 acres and will involve moving approximately 884,000 cubic yards of earthwork. 
The new projects are in Marion, Van Buren and Wapello counties.

People in both states who are covered by the federal health insurance program that primarily serves older adults have more trouble accessing and affording care than those in other states, and the quality of care they receive is lower, according to a report released Thursday by the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that studies health care access in the U.S. 
Medicare costs in Louisiana and Mississippi are some of the highest in the nation, but do not correspond to better health outcomes for patients. The states’ life expectancies at 65 are some of the lowest in the country, according to federal data. Mississippi comes in last place, with people living two years shorter than the national average. 
Lower ranking states have weaker overall health infrastructure, a trend across Southeastern states, said Gretchen Jacobson, the Commonwealth Fund’s vice president for Medicare. 
The report used 31 metrics to assess each state’s care, including strictness of prior authorization policies, access to outpatient care and how much beneficiaries pay. 
About 650,000 Mississippians and 960,000 Louisianans – over 20% of each state’s population – are enrolled in Medicare, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The program provides coverage to nearly all people 65 years or older and covers some younger people with disabilities. 
Sixty-nine million Americans are enrolled in Medicare, making it the largest payer for health care in the country. The program was established in 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson to provide health insurance to older Americans. It has changed over the last six decades, expanding eligibility to more people and offering additional benefits, like prescription drug coverage and Medicare Advantage plans. 
Private companies run Medicare Advantage plans and provide an alternative to traditional Medicare. About half of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in such plans. 
Medicare was designed to deliver uniform benefits to older Americans regardless of where they live, but states differ widely in their delivery of quality care, the report authors said. 
“We have more work to do to ensure it delivers the care equally and effectively for people in every state,” said Dr. Joseph Betancourt, president of the Commonwealth Fund, during a press conference Wednesday
Some disparities stem from how the program is structured, because Medicare relies on private providers to deliver care, said Mark Diana, associate dean for research and graduate programs at the University of West Florida who has researched health policy and management. 
“All of the variations in how private medical care is provided across the country exist in the Medicare program, just like everywhere else,” Diana said. 
While coverage may be the same across states, the services that patients are able to access may differ. 
In Louisiana and Mississippi, older Medicare recipients are prescribed medications that should be avoided in the elderly at higher rates than in other states, according to the report. Such medications increase the risk of confusion, falls, bleeding risk and other potential harms.
Nursing home residents who are hospitalized are readmitted to the hospital more frequently in Louisiana and Mississippi, and avoidable emergency room visits are more common,the report said.
Patients are sicker when they enroll in Medicare in Louisiana and Mississippi, where there are high rates of uninsurance and poverty, said David Radley, a senior scientist for the Commonwealth Foundation, during a press conference Wednesday. For example, more than two out of three Medicare beneficiaries in Mississippi and Louisiana have three or more chronic conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure.
“When people are sick coming into Medicare, they tend to be really sick when they’re in Medicare,” Radley said. 
Research has shown that people who are uninsured before age 65 have higher health care costs when they enroll in Medicare. 
Improving health care systems’ ability to care for people of all ages will enhance care for Medicare recipients, Jacobson said. 
Even with the support of Medicare, older people in Mississippi and Louisiana struggle to afford the costs of health care. More Medicare recipients in Mississippi and Louisiana went without care because they couldn’t afford it in the past year than in most other states. 
Experts say the Medicaid spending cuts passed this summer in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act may impact low-income Medicare beneficiaries, many of whom are enrolled in both programs. 
Cuts to Medicaid may make it more difficult for dually enrolled beneficiaries to access services that aren’t required to be provided by traditional Medicare plans, like dental care or home and community-based services, Jacobson said. 
More than a third of Mississippians and Louisianans over 65 went without a dental visit in the past year, the report said.
The legislation also imposed a moratorium on changes that aimed to reduce enrollment barriers for Medicare Savings Programs, which allow Medicaid to pay Medicare premiums and other costs for low-income beneficiaries. These changes will not be implemented until 2034.

(DOC photo)Blaming 1970s infrastructure that apparently has not been properly maintained, the Montana Department of Corrections presented the beginning of a plan to permanently address water issues at the Montana State Prison.
In a late Wednesday news release, the department said it would “begin installing new, modern and permanent water infrastructure” with a $21 million appropriation after receiving approval from Gov. Greg Gianforte.
On Friday, DOC said a pipe broke at the prison in Deer Lodge that left it without running water or flushing toilets. Inmates have described concerns about food, sanitation and a lack of drinking water. 
The reported break took place while the prison is in the midst of a $211 million reconstruction that’s part of a large effort to improve and expand the state’s correctional system, a policy priority for the governor and many members of the legislature.
“Director (Brian) Gootkin instructed teams contracted to work on the construction of the new units at the prison to develop a design and plan to move forward with this (water) project as early as next week,” the release stated. “MSP’s water and sewer infrastructure was largely built in the 1970s. Since that time, work on the system has for the most part been limited to fixing problems, not maintaining or improving the system for the long haul.”
Gootkin said the prison will continue providing water to inmates while it takes  on “this longer fix.”
“Years of deferred maintenance have caught up with us and we’re finding multiple failures throughout the system,” Gootkin said in a press release.
On Wednesday morning, members of the Montana Air National Guard set up a portable shower unit outside on the low security side of Montana State Prison. (DOC photo)
DOC officials said they have tried to find the source of the problem, calling in multiple water experts, the state’s National Guard and a Department of Natural Resources and Conservation command team. The department has brought in portable toilets and water bottles for inmates.
The prison in Deer Lodge houses 1,600 prisoners. It also has an economic impact on the local community, Powell County Commissioner Dan Sager said on Thursday.
Sager, whose district includes the prison, called the difficulties at the prison an “unfortunate situation” but said he felt they are being addressed and will be resolved.
The National Guard has been transporting water from the City of Deer Lodge fill station to the prison, the city’s public works superintendent, Trent Freeman, said in an email.
Money for ancillary items such as portable showers is coming out of state disaster emergency services funds. The emergency declaration Gianforte signed last week authorized funds from the Governor’s Emergency Appropriation, Kaitlin Price, the governor’s press secretary, wrote in an email.
Cost estimates are being compiled by each agency involved, she added. A total was not available from the Governor’s Office.
The new unit construction is part of the $211 million project at the prison stemming from 2023 legislation that will replace three of the four low-security housing units at the facility. Money for the new water repair is coming out of House Bill 5, which set aside $21 million for infrastructure at the prison.
The money was appropriated during the 2025 legislative session before the crisis.
“The department may also extend existing design, construction, and other contracts at its sole discretion, in order to expedite the project,” House Bill 5 reads.
Sen. Tom McGillvray, a Billings Republican who sat on a legislative committee that deals in part with DOC funding, said the legislature was ahead on this issue.
“Fortunately, we have the money set aside for that,” McGillvray said. “They’re just going to speed up the timeline.”
Construction companies at the site, including Sletten Construction, are assisting DOC in repairs by providing additional excavation equipment, a release from the state said late last week.
Sletten Construction did not respond to a voicemail left to regional company leadership. 
Construction on the housing units began in April, and it’s unclear how far along the project is, or whether the problems with water and construction are related.
DOC said it has found multiple leaks over the past two days.

“We are going to simultaneously continue our work to identify the issues with the existing system and install a modern system that will take us into the future,” Gootkin said. “This is not going to be an easy couple of months for inmates or staff, but the end result will be worth it.”
According to the DOC, water access will be rolled among units “throughout the day” to allow for work to occur on the system, though it was not immediately clear what parts of the prison have access to running water.
DOC reported that resources on site at the prison include 153 portable toilets (including 12 ADA-compliant) and 43 portable showers. All MSP inmates had the opportunity to take a shower by the end of Wednesday, a state press release said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MSP-Photo-4-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-16 19:04:52.993693

“It was a financial decision, but you're in our community,” one impacted parent said. “Your business thrives when our community thrives.”
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mount Snow to reduce child care offerings, citing ‘long-term sustainability’.","The Good family. Contributed by Amber Good
Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
Mount Snow Child Care in West Dover plans to scale down slots and staffing in its child care program for community members starting in November, resort leadership announced earlier this month. 
Alternative providers available on short notice are scarce in Dover and the surrounding Deerfield Valley, according to Amber Good, an affected parent. 
Good works as a physical therapist and has been supporting her family on one income after her husband was diagnosed with cancer in the spring. If her family cannot find a viable child care option, Good said she would have to step away from work to care for her children. 
Given her role as the region’s only full-time physical therapist who does at-home care, Good said the resort’s decision has left her concerned for her patients’ continued health access as well as her family’s finances.
In an Oct. 2 letter, Mount Snow Child Care Manager Katelyn Roske and Skier Services Director Brian Donovan wrote that the resort is shifting to an “employee-first” model, phasing out enrollment of non-employee families by Nov. 15 and creating a waitlist for children of local community members. Temporary child care slots for visitors to the resort are expected to remain.
The cuts will affect 16 non-employee families, according to Samara Sausville, a spokesperson for Vail Resorts, which since 2019 has owned and operated Mount Snow. Some parents believe the number of impacted families is higher. The resort declined to provide the number of staff positions it will eliminate.
With looming layoffs at the child care center, Good questioned whether Mount Snow’s move to decrease child care offerings is truly an “employee-first” approach to operations as the Oct. 2 letter suggested — or instead about cutting costs. 
“I understand you’re a business, and it was a financial decision, but you’re in our community,” Good said. “Your business thrives when our community thrives.”
Sausville said high costs, state-specific child care regulations, and challenges posed by Vermont’s “rural nature” have made the program unsustainable. Parents and advocates emphasized the difficulty the shift is causing to an area where child care offerings are relatively thin, as the community considers its relationship with one of the region’s largest employers.
The child care program has always operated at a loss, Sausville said, and — at least for the portion of the program that serves the children of employees year-round — will continue to do so. The decrease in offerings was necessary to “ensure the long-term sustainability of our operations,” she said in an email.
Erin Roche, director of the Vermont office of First Children’s Finance, said that while this change does not spell catastrophe for the region’s child care landscape in the long term, these cuts leave a “big gap.”
“It probably means that somebody in (each affected) household isn’t going to be able to keep a full schedule at work, or they’re going to have to reach out to friends and family,” she said. “This is an economic development issue, as much as it’s anything.”
Mount Snow Child Care has been a “cornerstone for families” in the Dover area for more than two decades, according to a petition circulated last week by affected parents. The aim of the petition — which has garnered 218 signatures as of Thursday afternoon — is to reverse Mount Snow’s decision and call on the resort to negotiate alternatives based on feedback from community stakeholders. 
The petition called the cuts “an act of corporate carelessness.”
Sausville said in an email Tuesday that the cuts were “a local decision made by the team at Mount Snow” and is unconnected with the company’s global two-year push to save $100 million in operating costs by the end of fiscal year 2026.
Richard Allin, an impacted parent in Wilmington, wrote an open letter posted on social media, urging Mount Snow and Vail Resorts to work with families and local governing bodies to devise sustainable solutions such as “limited community slots, exploring partnerships, or creating a cost-sharing model that works for everyone.”
“This decision separates children who have grown up together, leaves dedicated teachers without jobs, and forces many parents to make impossible choices about their own employment or even staying in the area,” Allin wrote.

‘Logistical and financial hurdles’
The cuts at Mount Snow come at a time of ongoing concerns with rural child care access. Though Roche cited significant improvements in Vermont’s child care coverage since the passage of Act 76 in 2023, she said the growth is still “not fast enough.”
Winston Prouty Center in Brattleboro is among the child care providers that received an uptick of enrollment requests since Mount Snow’s announcement despite having a waitlist, according to Kim Simeon, the organization’s Early Learning Center adminstrative director.
Andrea Sumner, the program director at East Dover’s Kids in the Country, said she had limited availability for toddlers, and more in her 3-and-up classroom. Though recent child care reforms have eased the financial position of her business, a lack of staff has kept her program from expanding to full capacity, she said.
“At this point, I don’t think it’s available child care slots. I think it’s finding available workforce,” she said.
In this period after the partial loss of a program, Roche said there may be opportunities for those who were laid off to join other providers to expand their capacity or to start their own business to fill the newly created need. First Children’s Finance offers some grants to assist in those efforts.
Vail Resorts acquired Mount Snow as part of a $264 million deal in 2019, which saw the complex’s former operator Peak Resorts subsumed into its new owner. The move added 17 ski areas to the Vail portfolio. It now runs 42 in total — and at least one is expanding rather than downsizing its child care offerings. At Vail’s Heavenly Mountain Resort in California, leadership announced in August that the resort would begin offering year-round child care to the local community. 
Sausville said that Vermont-specific factors heavily influenced the decision. State staff-to-child ratio regulations, as well as rules limiting price increases to families, contributed to an environment that the company deemed unsustainable.
The state’s rural layout presents “logistical and financial hurdles,” according to Sausville, that are less prevalent in relatively urban states like California, “where facilities may benefit from economies of scale and broader infrastructure support.”
At the moment, according to Sausville, a higher number of child care slots at Mount Snow translates to greater financial losses.
Roche also pointed to recent expansions and investments in child care programs from a number of other Vermont ski areas, including Stratton Mountain Resort and Vail’s own resort at Stowe, as well as the state’s massive investment in child care through tuition subsidies and other supports in Act 76.
“Part of me wonders if (Mount Snow was) taking full advantage of the sort of business and financial opportunities that the child care law (Act 76) would offer them,” Roche said.
Rep. Laura Sibilia, I-Dover, said her children attended the Mount Snow program and emphasized that the impact would reach beyond Dover to surrounding towns. The area’s child care offerings had been in “decent shape” in the past, she said, in large part because of Mount Snow, in addition to local pre-K programming.
“It feels most productive at this point to also be trying to think about ways to bring additional child care here to the valley,” Sibilia said.

(Getty Images)A long-running court battle over how to balance protections for endangered fish with hydropower dams in the Columbia River Basin has resumed after a two-year pause. 
Conservationists, anglers and clean energy groups, along with the state of Oregon, asked a federal court Tuesday to grant a preliminary injunction that would change how eight dams on the lower Columbia and Snake rivers operate. They argue that these changes would improve the conditions for salmon and steelhead survival.  
The state of Washington and the Nez Perce Tribe are supporting the request. 
The conservation groups and other plaintiffs want to see reservoir levels lowered and more water poured over spillways at the dams, starting in March 2026. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers operates the dams. 
“Columbia River salmon and steelhead have declined to dangerously low abundance levels and have faced a highly precarious status for years due in large part to the Corps’ operation of the Columbia River System dams and reservoirs,” says a request for a preliminary injunction that Earthjustice filed on behalf of the groups in federal court in Oregon.
The Public Power Council, which represents utilities and joined the suit on the side of the defendants, opposes the requested changes. 
In particular, the group says that the spill increases are “scientifically unproven, counterproductive to real salmon recovery, extremely costly to electricity consumers, and could spell disaster for our region’s grid reliability.” 
There are 18 dams on the mainstems of the Columbia and Snake rivers, including the eight targeted by the litigation. 
Overall, the federal hydropower system in the Columbia River Basin provides about 28% of the Pacific Northwest’s electricity, according to the Public Power Council. 
The dams provide irrigation and emissions-free hydropower for nearby communities, but have also contributed to the near extinction of 13 salmon and steelhead populations that return to the Columbia Basin from the Pacific Ocean to spawn. 
The fish are important to tribal health and sovereignty and to basin ecosystems, and the declines are hitting southern resident orca whales off the coasts of British Columbia, Washington and Oregon that rely on salmon for food and that are federally listed as endangered.
In addition to changes in dam operations, the groups behind the litigation are requesting other emergency conservation measures, including removing passage barriers for spring Chinook in the Tucannon River and increasing federal efforts to control predators that feed on salmon and steelhead. 
Earthjustice filed the request for a preliminary injunction on behalf of the National Wildlife Federation, Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations, Institute for Fisheries Resources, Sierra Club, Idaho Rivers United, Northwest Sportfishing Industry Association, NW Energy Coalition, Columbia Riverkeeper, Idaho Conservation League and Fly Fishers International, Inc. 
New chapter in a long-standing fight
This is the latest maneuver in litigation that dates back to 2001 and was paused as part of a multi-year agreement involving the federal government that was reached in 2023 under the Biden administration. 
President Donald Trump withdrew the federal government from that agreement in June.
“When the Trump administration reneged on this carefully negotiated agreement — and offered no alternative plan to restore imperiled salmon and steelhead — we had no option but to resume our longstanding litigation to protect endangered salmon,” said Earthjustice Attorney Amanda Goodin. 
As part of the “historic” deal — which was reached by the U.S. government, four tribes, Washington and Oregon — environmental groups agreed to pause litigation, and the federal government committed to investments in restoring Columbia River fish runs. 
Trump called the agreement “radical environmentalism” and said completion of the restoration initiative would “be devastating for the region.”
Washington state and the Nez Perce Tribe intend to formally support the conservation groups in their lawsuit as amicus parties, which allows them to offer information, expertise, or insight to aid the plaintiffs’ case in court. 
Oregon was not part of the 2001 case but joined Monday as an intervenor on the side of the conservation groups.
The federal government asked the court to pause the case until the federal government shutdown that began Oct. 1 ends, but a judge denied that request on Oct. 14, allowing Earthjustice and Oregon to file their injunction request that day. 
White House spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment. 
Utility groups point to strained grid
The Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the 2023 agreement was supported by the Northwest Public Power Association. The group also opposed this week’s court filing. 
“Our electric grid is under unprecedented strain, this motion risks plunging our region into crisis,” said Kurt Miller, the association’s CEO and executive director.
Public Power Council CEO and Executive Director Scott Simms said the federal withdrawal from the 2023 deal opened the door for renewed negotiations, and that the council was ready to participate in those talks. 
“Unfortunately, the plaintiffs chose litigation over collaboration, but it is not too late to engage in productive settlement conversations,” Simms said. 
The Northwest Public Power Association does support a return of salmon to blocked areas in a way that does not impact hydropower operations, referring to a 2022 proposal by the Upper Columbia United Tribes as a preferable option.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/snake-river-dam-lower-monumental-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-16 18:03:14.654820

A sustainable aviation fuel developer plans to shift investment from South Dakota to North Dakota, in part because of delays in the development of the multi-state Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline. 
Colorado-based Gevo had obtained a $1.46 billion loan through the U.S. Department of Energy to build a jet fuel plant at Lake Preston, South Dakota. Company officials told the North Dakota Monitor on Thursday that it instead will push ahead with making jet fuel at the Richardton, North Dakota, ethanol plant it bought last year. Gevo is working with the Department of Energy to transfer the loan to expand the North Dakota site. 
Red Trail Energy at Richardton in 2022 became the first ethanol plant in the country to capture and store carbon dioxide, taking advantage of its location in an area with the right geology for permanent underground storage. 
Gevo plans to expand the North Dakota ethanol plant, which turns corn into fuel. It would convert the ethanol into higher-value aviation fuel in a process it calls alcohol to jet. Carbon capture is a key part of making sustainable aviation fuel.
“We don’t have to share pipelines. We don’t have to wait. We’re already doing it,” CEO Pat Gruber said of carbon capture at the North Dakota site. 
Gevo’s South Dakota site relied on the planned Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline to take carbon dioxide to an underground storage site in North Dakota. But the future of that project in South Dakota is in doubt because of landowner resistance and state permitting hurdles. 
North Dakota attorney general says legal action against South Dakota pipeline law not an option

Iowa-based Summit is seeking to change its pipeline permit in that state. Summit wants to remove North Dakota as the designated end point for the pipeline. 
A spokesperson for Summit said Friday the change “keeps open the option to transport CO2 west through Nebraska or north through South Dakota,” reported the Iowa Capital Dispatch. 
Gruber said the jet fuel production in North Dakota would be 30 million gallons of jet fuel a year, half of what was planned for South Dakota. But he said the 500 acres at Richardton could allow for expansion. 
He said the jet fuel plant would cost about $500 million. Gruber noted that is substantially less than $2.6 billion it planned to spend on the South Dakota site. 
Gevo is hosting a meeting Monday to answer questions for farmers and others in the Richardton area. The meeting will be from 6 to 7:30 Mountain Time at WIX Barn near Richardton. 
Gruber said building in North Dakota also opens the door to Gevo selling its carbon to the oil industry. North Dakota oil producers could buy the carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery — pumping gas into the well to help the well produce more oil. 
“This is a great opportunity for us, and we sit right next to Bakken,” Gruber said, referring to the Bakken Formation. North Dakota is the nation’s No. 3 oil producing state, with most of it coming from the Bakken. 
Oil industry and state leaders have touted enhanced oil recovery as a way for North Dakota to sustain oil production for decades to come and continue to provide the state with tax revenue. 
Gruber said Gevo has started discussion with oil companies, but he said the infrastructure to make enhanced oil recovery possible is still years away. 
Ethanol plants are seen as a prime source for carbon dioxide because the gas is captured from the fermentation process of turning corn into ethanol instead of from the burning of fuel. 
“It’s pure, concentrated CO2,” Gruber said. 
Another benefit of carbon capture for Gevo is the ability to sell carbon credits to other industries with high carbon emissions. Gevo in September announced it is partnering with Biorecro North America on carbon credit sales generated at the North Dakota facility.
Gruber said he was grateful the Department of Energy for working with Gevo on transferring the federal loan, though there are steps remaining to complete the process. Gevo filed a document with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday of its intent to use the loan money in North Dakota. 
As for the future of the eastern South Dakota site, Gevo officials said it remains a great industrial location and will be developed. 
“The are other things we can do at that site,” said Paul Bloom, Gevo’s chief business officer. “It’s a matter of when.” 
But the Gevo officials said the demand for sustainable aviation fuel meant the company could not wait for the Summit pipeline. Summit had hoped to be operating in 2024 but has yet to start construction as it tries to secure all the permits it needs. 
“We can’t sit around for that,” Gruber said.  “We’ve got a mission here.”

The studio’s founder, lead designer and artist checked in on the latest progress. Colorful glass mosaics, including the studio’s iconic spirit bird, spiff up the floor of a renovated bathroom. A new kitchen awaits catered events, and the reworked marketing space holds stained glass windows studio visitors always want to see. A former ceiling joist is charred and treated for a second life in a window. Young happily demonstrated an ADA accessible automatic door, among upgrades possible by a Mississippi Arts Commission Building Fund for the Arts grant, for the relatively new Pearl River Glass Conservatory, a sister nonprofit with glass art classes for the public. 
A huge window, encased in a steel frame Young salvaged from a downtown office demo 21 years ago, streams natural light for the new ceramics studio. Asiatic jasmine twigs peek up from a thick blanket of pinestraw in a sidewalk bed with two young tulip poplars, and transplanted irises settle into their new home along a border. 
All point to a visionary creative, businessman, gardener even, playing the long game.

A golden anniversary salute to that long game happens Saturday, Oct. 18, as the studio celebrates 50 years in business with a reception that honors its past and looks to the future. The 2-6 p.m. event is free, welcoming the public to its home at 142 Millsaps Ave. in Jackson, with a live demonstration of leaded stained glass window construction, refreshments, music, door prizes and giveaways. 
Tickets are on sale now for an accompanying raffle with the grand prize of a year of free classes (a $1,340 value) at the Pearl River Glass Conservatory. Proceeds from the raffle and a 4-6 p.m. silent auction at Saturday’s event benefit the conservatory.
“My legacy project” is how Young, 73, describes the Pearl River Glass Conservatory, started two years ago this January. With its own dedicated space in the Wesley Avenue building that once held Patton Publishing and Offbeat, the conservatory is dedicated to preserving and advancing the art of glass. 
“We have spent all this time learning how to do all these wonderful things,” Young said of studio innovations in fused glass, acid etching and more that pushed the expressive potential of the medium. “I didn’t want it to just disappear without making an effort.
“It’s always been about creativity,” he described the studio renowned for church window creation and restoration, architectural installments, contemporary art works in glass and home and garden decor. 
“We wanted to find a way to share that with the community at large, too.” 
Weekly classes do that, from introduction to leaded glass to fun seasonal projects like fused pumpkins or spooky garden stakes this month. Christmas ornament classes start in November, and plans are to expand offerings in the coming year.
Such efforts address multiple fronts, from providing an authentic, creative experience increasingly rare in today’s consumer society, to giving back to a community for their decades of support, Young said. He sees a deeper value as well. 
“As we move forward, people are going to need to have as many creative skills as they can, to cope with the changing dynamic of our society.
“And also, I’m a businessperson, so I’m always interested in trying to ingratiate myself with the public as much as possible,” he confessed with a chuckle. “That’s how we stay alive, you know?”

Pearl River Glass Studio began in a one-car garage in downtown Jackson in 1975, and within the next year moved to what became its forever home on Millsaps Avenue in the city’s Midtown neighborhood, drawn by cheap rent and available space in what was the city’s first industrial and wholesale commercial district.
It started with a single building on Millsaps Avenue, rented for $200 a month. “If the rent hadn’t been so cheap, I don’t think we would have been able to last in business,” he said with a fond look back at the cozy, efficient, 2,000 square-foot starter space. 
One Christmas break, his drive-around survey of the area’s empty buildings found about 200,000 square feet of vacant space in a few blocks. “I realized if there was going to be an arts district, it could be here.” 
Additional artists moved into studio spaces in the area, with a Midtown Arts District heyday in the 1990s and early 2000s. Though the scene is quieter now, it remains abuzz with working artists and other creative professionals, and continues to inspire the next generation of artists.
The studio bought its home building from the landlord’s heirs in 1985, renovated a second building in 1995 and bought more property and continued to expand about 15 years later. It remains a high-profile art anchor in the district.
 “We are proud to celebrate Pearl River Glass Studio’s 50 years of creativity and excellence!” Midtown Partners Executive Director Kristi Hendrix said in an email. “They have long embodied the spirit of innovation, craftsmanship, and even planted the early seeds for what has now developed into Midtown’s Creative Economy Initiative.” The studio’s visitorship and artist support demonstrate the impact a creative enterprise can have within a community.
“They have also been a constant reminder of what’s possible when creativity and community grow side by side,” she said.
Over the years, Pearl River Glass Studio has grown to its current 17 employees and 17,000 square feet across multiple buildings in a campus that spreads from the original Millsaps Avenue building north to Wesley Avenue, which the conservatory fronts.
The studio has always been a collaborative, Young said. The nature of the art form, and the series of functions it requires, demands more people. 
“It was never just me,” he said.

Many area artists have worked there at one time or another, including Bebe Wolfe, Jerrod Partridge, Ron Lindsey and more, and so have successful lawyers downtown when they were students at Millsaps College, Young said. The different contributions feed an atmosphere of creative problem-solving.
“The creativity part of it is a key component in the success of the company — the idea of innovation,” Young said. “All of that is a sort of cornerstone to how we operate, and so, having the various creative artists as part of that has been part of the special sauce.”
Glass painter and artist Rob Cooper came to Pearl River Glass Studio first as a Forest Hill senior and an internship through APAC in 1994. This year he marks 31 years at the studio. Stained glass church work is the studio’s bread and butter. 
“Andy was keeping up with design work, and meeting the churches in a more modern way,” he said. “Innovation is one thing Andy likes to do — leaning into the curve of what glass can do.” 
That was a key spark for Cooper’s imagination as well. 
From the early days of fusing glass to create imagery (now a big staple), to painting, acid etching and different mark making techniques, “I got to be on the ground floor of trying new things,” Cooper said.
Some key projects over the years include Pearl River Glass Studio’s 2015 restoration of the more than 100 outside stained glass windows in the 1903 Mississippi State Capitol, including the three stunning monumental figures that grace its staircase landing, and the restoration of the House of Representatives Chamber stained glass skylight dome, completed last July (now safely stored and awaiting reinstallation).

 “Mississippians should really be proud of that structure,” he said of the historical building. “It’s really a tour de force as far as design and execution.” 
The commission for stained glass windows for Christ United in Jackson ranked among Young’s favorites, for their large size, the creativity required and the way it suited his skills. 
“The stained glass windows were my particular style — kind of contemporary with Christian symbols,” Young said. “The stained glass windows are always telling a story.”
He also noted the windows at St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church in Madison, another large-scale commission for a new church and point of pride, with stained glass windows that told the saint’s story.
While the studio remains interested in new church commissions, church construction seems less robust than in years past. The business has adapted, focusing on repair, restoration and maintenance of church windows around the state.
“We’ve had wonderful opportunities over the years,” Young said, highlighting the conservatory as a way to continue engaging with a community that has embraced their art from the start, and continues to a half century later.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/16102212/restoration-MS-State-Capitol-House-of-Representatives.jpg,,,2025-10-16 18:03:14.654820

Two months after its severing, a vital transportation link for small cities in two of Washington’s largest counties will reopen Friday.
The White River Bridge connecting eastern King and Pierce counties has been closed since mid-August when it was struck by an overheight truck and significantly damaged. It will open for traffic between 5 p.m. and midnight on Friday, Gov. Bob Ferguson announced Thursday.
“We’re hoping it’s on the earlier side of 5 p.m., but it’ll be in that window. We’re extremely excited about that,” Ferguson said at a news conference at the bridge.
“We understood how challenging the situation was for the community,” he said. “A lot of things could have gone in a different direction, but through a lot of hard work and a little bit of luck, we’re super excited to be opening up this early, literally weeks early.”
Enumclaw Mayor Jan Molinaro, Buckley Mayor Beau Burkett, and King County Councilmember Reagan Dunn were among a throng of local officials, business owners, and workers who joined Ferguson for the announcement.
The steel truss bridge, built in 1949, is on State Route 410 and is a lifeline for the cities of Enumclaw and Buckley. Before the crash, it carried more than 22,000 vehicles per day, according to the state Department of Transportation.
The closure disrupted daily life of residents and the economies of the two cities.
“Economically, we’ve been hurting,” Molinaro said. ”We really want to get life back to a normal situation, and this allows us to do that.”
State transportation officials ordered the bridge closed Aug. 18, citing the severity of damage. 
Nine days later, Ferguson declared a state of emergency in the two counties, enabling the state to pursue federal funds for reimbursement of repairs. The emergency proclamation estimated repairs could exceed $2 million. Updated information on costs was not immediately available Thursday.
There’s no guarantee the state will recoup its expenses. The Federal Emergency Management Agency this year has twice rejected the state’s request for federal help to cover tens of millions of dollars in damage caused by a bomb cyclone late last year.
The disaster declaration could help provide funding to businesses hurt by the closure. King County is looking at a loan program run by the U.S. Small Business Administration to potentially help local establishments. Some businesses have applied, according to speakers at Thursday’s event.
The incident is spurring the Washington State Department of Transportation to put in additional signs on both sides of the span warning of the bridge height. Also, the state is looking to install an advanced warning system, such as a flashing sign or road bumps, for the bridge, WSDOT Secretary Julie Meredith said.
Ferguson said his proposed 2026 supplemental budget will seek more dollars for maintenance and preservation of Washington’s highways and bridges. He will release his proposal in December. 
State transportation officials warned again this week that underfunding has put the state’s transportation system in the “early stages of critical failure.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/410-tearing-921x1024.jpg,,,2025-10-16 18:03:14.654820

Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican, for bringing the issue to his attention. “She's the first one that told me about this,” he said. “I had not known too much about it, and we worked very rapidly together.”Britt advocated for IVF after an Alabama Supreme Court ruling last year made the treatment illegal in the state. The state Legislature soon passed a law to ensure IVF remained legal.At the Oval Office event Thursday, Britt offered high praise for Trump, saying he had prioritized the issue since the first time the pair spoke by phone.“IVF is what makes the difference for so many families that are facing infertility,” she said. “The recommendations today that President Trump has set forth are going to expand IVF coverage to nearly a million more families, and they're going to drive down cost significantly. Mr. President, this is the most pro-IVF thing that any president in the history of the United States of America has done.”Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. added that Trump was also “addressing the root causes” of infertility through a Make America Healthy Again agenda that seeks to avoid exposure to chemicals. Trump, asked about potential opposition from religious conservatives who oppose IVF, said he was unconcerned. “This is very pro-life,” he said. “You can't get more pro-life than this.”",,,,2025-10-16 18:03:14.654820

Dubbed the FastSites program, the initiative is backed by $150 million from a Site Investment and Infrastructure Fund state lawmakers approved earlier this year, according to the Louisiana Economic Development agency.  
FastSites relies on participation from local governments, nonprofit groups, development authorities and private landowners who can apply and compete for the funding. The allocations from the fund will be structured as forgivable loans or a partnership deal with the state. 
The money can be used to purchase tracts of land and partially develop it by, for example, demolishing old buildings, clearing trees, providing road and rail access or upgrading utility connections to the site.  
“This is one of the most forward-thinking site development models in the country,” LED Chief Economic Competitiveness Officer Ileana Ledet said in a news release. “FastSites aligns government efficiency with private-sector speed, ensuring Louisiana can meet the demands of global investment while strengthening our communities and infrastructure.”
The funding awards will range from a minimum of $1 million to as much as $25 million. Applicants must match the funding by as much as 50% to 80%, depending on the project type. Private landowners who qualify for the funding will have higher matching requirements and won’t be eligible for future loan forgiveness, according to LED. 
The application period for the inaugural round of funding opens Oct. 30 and closes Dec. 15. LED will host an informational webinar about the program at 2 p.m. Monday, Oct. 27.

After the press conference, Mitchell said her son, Terregernal S. Martin, is among those charged in the shooting. She said he did not fire a weapon, but was working as security at a building near where gunfire broke out.
She said it’s been frustrating trying to get in touch with law enforcement agencies that are involved in the investigation and to advocate for her son. She has been able to talk to him on the phone while he is being held at the Washington County jail. 
“I hate to see this happen,” Mitchell said, noting how her son grew up with one of the victims. She said she was inside a club near the Leland block party and dropped to the floor when she heard gunshots and saw bodies lying on the ground. 
Nine arrests have been made in Leland, but only five names have been made public, including Martin, 33, who is charged with capital murder. The others are Morgan Lattimore, 25, charged with capital murder; Teviyon L. Powell, 29, capital murder; William Bryant, 29, capital murder; and Latoya A. Powell, 44, attempted murder.
The FBI said Martin’s bond was set at $1 million cash. Bond information for the rest was not immediately available. 
The shooting was one of several that happened during homecoming festivities on high school and college campuses last weekend, which left another four people dead and more injured. 
Two people in the Leland shooting remain in critical condition. More than 25 were hit by the gunfire.
Those killed have been identified as Oreshama Johnson, 41; Calvin Plant, 19; Shelbyona Powell, 25; Kaslyn Johnson, 18; Amos Brantley Jr., 18; and JaMichael Jones, 34.
At Thursday’s news conference, officials recognized the tragedy that the community has experienced and the grief it is processing, and said they will hold those responsible accountable.
The officials were asked about how to ensure public safety in Leland and in communities having homecoming celebrations. They responded that there would be an increased law enforcement presence. 
Mississippi Public Safety Commissioner Sean Tindell said there is much to be done to answer questions of why the shooting happened. When asked what can be done to prevent similar shootings, he said that is a question communities will need to answer. 
A day earlier in Columbus, Gov. Tate Reeves offered his potential solutions after the recent shootings: Convince young people who are committing crimes to value life and to know that actions have consequences.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-16 21:42:25+00:00,Mississippi Today,Report: Mississippi schools face chronic absenteeism,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/16/report-mississippi-schools-face-chronic-absenteeism/,"Chronic absenteeism, or students missing 10% or more of the school year, has more than doubled in Mississippi since 2018.","More than a quarter of Mississippi students are chronically absent from school.
A new report from the Mississippi Department of Education revealed that rates of chronic absenteeism, defined as missing at least 10% of the year or 18 days of school, are on the rise. 
While chronic absenteeism rates decreased slightly for middle and elementary schools, overall the percentage has more than doubled from 13% during the 2018-19 school year to 27.6% during this past school year, or 120,408 students. The increase is largely due to a huge uptick among high schoolers — a 9% increase in the past two years — especially toward the end of the year when some students are exempt from exams. 
It’s not a Mississippi-specific issue, State Superintendent Lance Evans stressed at Thursday’s state Board of Education meeting. Nationwide, chronic absenteeism rates nearly doubled during the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. Department of Education reports that 28% of students were considered chronically absent during the 2022-23 school year. 
But the report comes at a precarious time for the state’s public education system. After years of huge academic gains, Mississippi students have slipped slightly in some areas, recent tests show. Absenteeism is directly tied to student achievement — when students miss school, they miss essential instruction time. It can add up, leaving chronically absent students far behind their peers. 
That’s why the agency is working hard to combat it, Evans said. 
“We already have a plan moving forward,” he told state board members on Thursday. “We’re beefing that up even more.” 
Legislators have increasingly expressed concern about the state’s chronic absenteeism rate. Evans said at the meeting that Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann is particularly interested in the numbers, and lawmakers heard the agency’s strategies to get more students to school at a Senate education committee meeting last week. 
Mississippi Department of Education officials told senators that moving forward, the agency would implement consistent systems for documenting absenteeism, focus on graduation success rather than dropout prevention and build outreach systems to intervene earlier when students start missing school. Evans said at the board meeting that the agency’s plan also calls for more personnel and an overhaul of the office that oversees attendance. 
The report also said that the agency is encouraging districts to “adopt recognition programs to reinforce positive attendance habits, build partnerships with health care providers, provide flexibility for families facing extenuating circumstances.” It is also asking them to “implement grade-specific supports — such as advisory periods, peer mentoring, and career or technical pathway connections — to strengthen engagement among older students.”
The merits of engaging families on the importance of getting their child to school is clear because of the low absenteeism rates among younger students, the report notes. By grade, chronic absenteeism is lowest in Mississippi in the 4th grade, steadily decreasing each year from kindergarten. But as students advance into higher grades, rates go up again, hitting a peak in the 12th grade. 
Senators were especially concerned about the 12th-grade numbers and asked the state education agency to prioritize making senior year more about college and career preparation, so students would take attendance more seriously. Some districts permit seniors who aren’t taking a full load of classes to leave school during the day. 
That was shocking news for Sen. Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory, who conveyed his disappointment to education officials at the committee meeting. 
“It seems to me that what we’re doing … is signaling to students it’s not really important to come to school,” he said. “We’re shifting from the concept of, there’s an infinite number of things to learn … to something that is so focused on the requirements and testing.”
Districts with the lowest chronic absenteeism rates in the state, all lower than 15%, are Okolona School District, Jefferson County School District, East Jasper School District, New Albany Public Schools and Rankin County School District.
Jackson Public Schools, despite its chronic absenteeism rate of 37.7% district-wide, has the lowest school-specific rate in Mississippi. Just 2.5% of students at McWillie Elementary School are considered chronically absent. 
The state’s highest chronic absenteeism rates are in Claiborne County Public Schools, Moss Point School District, Simpson County School District, North Panola School District and Holly Springs. Nearly half of students at the districts are considered chronically absent. 
Smaller schools in districts with high-poverty rates have higher chronic absenteeism rates, data show. 
Superintendents for three of Mississippi’s four school districts under state control — all in areas with large low-income populations — gave presentations to state Board of Education members Thursday, directly tying chronic absenteeism to their academic struggles.
Stanley Ellis from Humphreys County said the school district was incentivizing attendance with ice cream socials, “dress down days” and recognition for students with perfect attendance. 
Yazoo City High School saw a surge in absenteeism at its high school and a 20-point drop in graduation rates, said Superintendent Earl Watkins. He stressed that improving the numbers will require a shift in perspective among parents and community members about the importance of attending school and staying the whole day.
“Parent liaisons are calling home when kids aren’t at school,” he said. “We need to change the mindset around kids needing to be at school every day.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/18114610/3X0A8609.jpg,,,2025-10-16 18:03:14.654820
,DC,2025-10-16 21:31:37+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"National parks, public lands feared at risk of long-term harm as shutdown drags on",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/national-parks-public-lands-feared-risk-long-term-harm-shutdown-drags,,"Bare-bones staffing during the government shutdown across the Interior Department and the U.S. Forest Service is leaving America’s treasured natural assets vulnerable to lasting damage, according to advocates for public lands, including current and former agency employees.National parks and most public lands remain accessible to visitors, including those run by the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management and Fish and Wildlife Service. But the lack of staff already has led to reports of bad behavior, like illegal camping and BASE jumping at California’s Yosemite National Park, and parks advocates and workers told States Newsroom they fear more to come as the shutdown that began Oct. 1 continues with no end in sight.Adjustments to park staff meant to “front-load visitor services” hide some of the long-term harms, said John Garder, the senior director of budget and appropriations at the advocacy group National Parks Conservation Association. The NPS furloughed more than 9,000 of its roughly 14,500 workers, according to a planning document published just before the shutdown began on Oct. 1. That has left the people responsible for protecting ""irreplaceable resources” and trail management workers needing to instead clean visitor centers and oversee parking, Garder said.“What that's done is created this facade for the visitors, so that in many cases they don't see the damage that's happening behind the scenes,” he said in a phone interview Wednesday.Should parks be closed?The NPCA, a nonprofit that advocates for national parks, has called for parks to close during the shutdown to avoid lasting damage. Others in the conservation community have joined in.Aaron Weiss, the deputy director of the conservation advocacy group Center for Western Priorities, likened the situation to allowing visitors to ramble through an unstaffed Smithsonian museum.“The national parks are effectively museums,” he said. “This would be like the Smithsonian saying, ‘Well, you know, we don't have the staff to keep the Smithsonian museum staffed, but we'll go ahead and leave the gates, the doors open, and come in and take a look, do what you want.’ “That would be horrifically irresponsible of the Smithsonian, but that is exactly what the National Park Service is saying.”The nature of many park sites makes closing difficult. The largest parks, comprising sprawling lands, often lack comprehensive fencing or other ways to keep people out. Public lands outside the Park Service, including those managed by BLM and the Forest Service, are even less likely to have barriers to entry.Still, the Interior Department under President Donald Trump has prioritized keeping parks open to an extent other administrations have not planned for during shutdowns, by transferring funds meant for park maintenance to be used for operations.Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has downplayed reports of improper behavior in the parks while blaming the closures on congressional Democrats who have mostly opposed a stopgap spending bill that would reopen the government. Democrats want Republicans to negotiate on expiring health care tax credits.“Of course, all of our many sites…. would be better operated and better staffed if the Senate would just get us back in the government,” Burgum said in a Fox News interview Tuesday. “Way to go, Senate Democrats.”Spokespeople for the NPS did not return messages seeking comment this week. Many communications staff across the federal government have been furloughed during the shutdown and are not legally allowed to respond to messages.BLM spokeswoman Alyse Sharpe said in an email that the agency would “keep public lands as accessible as possible” during the shutdown. “Critical functions that protect life, property, and public health will remain in place, including visitor access in many locations, law enforcement, and emergency response,” she wrote.Sharpe did not respond to questions about the concerns over lands’ long-term health.‘Demoralizing’ atmosphereMeanwhile, the shutdown has accelerated a drop in morale for the federal workforce responsible for public lands, at least some of whom are exasperated by what they see as the Trump administration’s failure to value their work. More than half of Interior’s nearly 60,000 employees have been furloughed during the shutdown. That reality, on top of staff reductions earlier this year and threatened additional layoffs by Trump and White House budget director Russ Vought, have added to a sense for many resource managers that the administration doesn’t place a priority on their jobs.Chris Tollefson, a former communications official at the BLM and the Fish and Wildlife Service who took a buyout this year after a nearly 27-year run at the Interior agencies, said the administration’s posture was “demoralizing” for the agencies’ career employees who consider their work on behalf of public lands a calling.“The people I know get into this because they care passionately about the land and about the resources they protect,” he said. “Most of them have deep roots in the communities they come from, and it's really demoralizing to feel like your life's work has been devalued and that what you're doing doesn't matter, that the people in charge feel like it doesn't matter. So it's been really hard.”One furloughed Interior Department worker, who requested her identity be withheld because she is not authorized to speak to reporters, said the department may have trouble attracting qualified employees in the future.“I came to the government to get a little bit more stability, thinking that it was going to be a safer bet,” the furloughed worker said. “And that has definitely not been the case. It's not felt as stable as other positions. … I think a lot of folks that are with the federal government are there because of the perception of stability. When you take away that perception of stability, those positions aren't going to be quite as attractive to talent that you would have attracted.”Oil and gas permitting continuesFurther irritating advocates of conservation, the shutdown has not slowed oil and gas development despite furloughs of staff responsible for science and recreation.As of Oct. 15, the BLM had issued an average of 19.8 oil and gas permits per day since the shutdown began at the start of the month. That’s roughly on par with a typical month during Trump’s second administration, and represents the highest per-day average since May, according to an analysis of publicly available data by Weiss.“It's a statement of values,” Weiss said. “The Interior Department is telling the agency and telling America, ‘The folks who manage drilling on public lands are more important than the folks who actually do the day-to-day caring for our public lands.’ You don't have the biologists, you don't have the land managers, you don't have the folks doing the trail maintenance. Those folks have all been furloughed, but the folks doing the oil and gas permitting are somehow essential.”Agencies and departments can list some workers as exempt from furloughs. Those employees are kept on the job, though they generally do not receive paychecks until the government is reopened. In a post to Instagram on the first day of the shutdown, the Interior Department said it would continue issuing permits “and other efforts related to American Energy Dominance” despite a lapse in appropriations.",,,,2025-10-16 18:03:14.654820
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-16 21:20:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT and Prospect Medical Holdings landlord clash over tax debt,Katy Golvala and Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/16/ct-prospect-medical-holdings-tax-forgiveness/,"The issue plays a central role in ongoing negotiations for UConn Health to acquire Waterbury Hospital, currently owned by Prospect.","Medical Properties Trust — a real-estate investment company that owns the land and buildings occupied by bankrupt hospital operator Prospect Medical Holdings — is at odds with Connecticut officials over what its tenant owes the state in unpaid taxes, State Comptroller Sean Scanlon said during an interview with The Connecticut Mirror on Wednesday.
The issue plays a central role in ongoing negotiations for the state’s struggling flagship medical institution, UConn Health, to acquire Waterbury Hospital currently owned by Prospect. The acquisition is part of a UConn Health expansion plan, which also includes the proposed acquisition of two independent hospitals, Bristol Hospital and Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam. 
Earlier this month, the University of Connecticut’s Board of Trustees and the UConn Health Board of Directors authorized a bid of up to $13 million to acquire Waterbury Hospital — along with its land and buildings. Some level of tax forgiveness will also be part of the deal, Scanlon confirmed.
But right now, the parties can’t even agree on what Prospect owes.
“Tax liability was always going to be factored into the ultimate purchase price of this hospital as part of the negotiation,” Scanlon said. “The reason why it’s hard to give a definitive number is because that is being negotiated right now as part of this bankruptcy.”
Spokespeople with Medical Properties Trust and Prospect Medical Holdings did not respond to requests for comment. 
Prospect Medical Holdings filed for bankruptcy protection in January, and the sale of its hospitals around the country is being overseen by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern Texas. The hospital’s landlord, Alabama-based Medical Properties Trust, has played a key role in the negotiations of the hospital sales.
In 2019, Medical Properties Trust, one of the country’s biggest hospital landlords, purchased the land and buildings of Prospect’s hospitals in Connecticut, California and Pennsylvania for $1.4 billion. The deal, referred to as a “sale-leaseback,” helped to fund a $457 million dividend to Prospect’s private equity owners and investors, but left the three Connecticut hospitals with a new expense: rent payments to MPT. 
MPT also owned the hospital buildings of the Steward Health Care system — a for-profit chain that operated hospitals in multiple states, including Massachusetts, and also filed for bankruptcy protection.
When Prospect filed for bankruptcy, Gov. Ned Lamont insisted that he didn’t think keeping the hospitals open would require “taxpayer subsidies.” Now, the state seems poised to forgive millions of dollars in unpaid taxes to facilitate the UConn deal.
Spokespeople for Lamont did not respond to a request for comment. 
The tax forgiveness would require legislative approval. 
In conversations earlier this week, House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said the legislature would likely approve waiving Prospect’s tax bill.
“If we want to support UConn Health’s taking over the hospital then we will have to if it’s part of the deal,” Ritter said. “Otherwise you have to consider the alternatives — that the hospital could potentially close or some other private equity firm could come in and buy it.”
House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said that while he agrees it’s vital to consider the needs of the state’s health care system, he’s not going to give a deal the OK before seeing the details.
“I’m not going to make it easy for Prospect to get the best deal they can. So if they think that the legislature is just going to rubber-stamp because we’re desperate, they’re wrong,” Candelora said. “I think it’s important for us as legislators to make it very clear that what Prospect did to the state of Connecticut hospital systems is egregious.”
What does Prospect owe?
In December 2023, the state’s Department of Revenue Services filed liens showing Prospect Medical Holdings had neglected to pay $67 million in taxes.
During a press conference in January of this year hosted by Gov. Ned Lamont, Attorney General William Tong said Prospect owed Connecticut “more than $100 million.” 
CT Mirror reached out to DRS to clarify Prospect’s current tax liability. 
DRS spokesperson Tiffany Thiele said the agency cannot disclose what Prospect owes in taxes because the department is prohibited by statute from releasing “taxpayer information, including liabilities.”
Earlier this week, CT Mirror reported that the state plans to borrow $390 million to fund the expansion of UConn Health. The funding would primarily go towards capital improvement projects at all three hospitals, though it would also support the acquisition of Waterbury Hospital, Scanlon said. Funding to acquire Bristol and Day Kimball hospitals would be handled separately, he added.
Waterbury Hospital, in particular, would need a major influx of capital funding to bring it up to the state’s standards for its medical facilities, Scanlon said.
“There are significant capital expenditure needs to maintain what I would say is the level of public health care that our citizens deserve and expect. And, frankly, that’s not possible in the condition that this hospital is in right now,” he said.
Also at issue are taxes owed to municipalities. As of January 2025, Prospect and MPT owed upwards of $23 million to Waterbury, Manchester, Vernon and South Windsor, according to a report from the Journal Inquirer. 
Waterbury accounted for over $20 million of the funds owed. At the time, MPT had filed a tax appeal regarding the appraised value of the hospital building at 64 Robbins Street, according to city officials. 
The city of Waterbury’s Director of Finance Michael LeBlanc said negotiations are “ongoing” and “confidential.”
“There have been ongoing negotiations between the City’s Representing Counsel and Debtor’s Counsel in furtherance of reaching a settlement on the real and personal property taxes,” LeBlanc said in emailed comments. “We cannot comment further at this time.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023_0927_SR_WaterburyHospital_027-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-16 18:03:14.654820
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-16 21:16:05+00:00,CT Mirror,Bridgeport student assault raises questions about walking distance to school,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/16/bridgeport-walk-school-student-assault/,"Bridgeport high schoolers are expected to walk up to 2 miles before being eligible for the bus, which one parent called ‘ridiculously long.","The sexual assault of a Bridgeport teen during her Tuesday morning walk to the high school has raised concerns about the distance that some students in the urban district must travel on foot each day. 
The teenager who was assaulted on Railroad Avenue in Bridgeport was on her way to the new Bassick High School on the University of Bridgeport campus. The road where she was assaulted runs alongside a raised railroad track and through an industrial district. 
Bridgeport Police charged 28-year-old Cordero Javier Greaves later that day with first-degree sexual assault, risk of injury to a minor, illegal sexual contact with a person under 16 years of age, first-degree unlawful restraint and second-degree threatening. 
In Bridgeport, high school students are expected to walk up to 2 miles before they are eligible for a bus ride, while elementary students are expected to walk up to 1 mile — distances that are consistent with other urban districts and state guidance on the issue. 
The assault has sparked enough concern that the Bridgeport Board of Education is planning to hold a special meeting next week to discuss busing and student safety, said board member Albert Benejan Grajales.
“It’s our concern and it’s our priority right now,” said Benejan Grajales.
Connecticut state law requires school districts to provide transportation when it is “reasonable and desirable.” But state guidelines published in 2022 leave specific details like walking distances up to local school boards. Although the 2022 document does not give any distance recommendation, a 2008 document showing sample policies for districts recommended the maximum walking distance for students be 1 mile for children in grades K through 3, 1.5 miles for students in grades 4 through 8, and 2 miles for high school students. 
Hartford Public Schools and Waterbury Public Schools also list their maximum walking distance for high schoolers as 2 miles; in New Haven, the distance is 1.5 miles. 
The 2022 document does note that a district can make exceptions for students who could encounter “hazardous conditions” on their way to school. 
“This heartbreaking assault on a young student is deeply concerning. Decisions about walking distances and student transportation are made locally, and we trust that districts will take all local conditions into consideration—especially student safety—as they review and implement their transportation policies,” State Department of Education spokesperson Matt Cerrone said in a statement Thursday.
This is not a new issue for the district. Over the summer, Bridgeport officials, hoping to save $4.6 million, approved cuts to the education transportation budget that would have increased the distance some 629 high school students had to walk to school from 2 to 2.5 miles.
The cuts didn’t sit well with everyone on the Board of Education, with one member calling the increased walking distances “really concerning” because kids would be forced “to walk on dangerous streets without sidewalks,” according to published reports, but the board approved the distance changes anyway. 
A sudden infusion of funding from the city and state in late August, however, allowed the district to keep existing bus routes intact. The state Department of Education, which contributed $825,000 for transportation costs, also worked with the district to renegotiate its busing contract in a way that “restores and streamlines” the bus routes the district planned to cut, according to a press release. 
Despite the last-minute funding from the state, Board of Education members voted in September to rewrite their policy to increase the maximum walking distance by half a mile for all students. 
“The reason we’re doing this is because, yes, transportation was saved for this year only, but there was no guaranteed funding for next year in the budget to maintain those distances,” Joseph Sokolovic, a member of the Board of Education, said during an August meeting when the policy was discussed. 
It is unclear whether that policy will be changed in the wake of the sexual assault.
Callie Heilmann, parent of a student in Bridgeport Public Schools and founder and president of Bridgeport Generation Now, said that hearing about the assault made her feel sick, but not surprised. 
“ There really is no safe walk to school if you’re coming from the West Side, West End, Black Rock neighborhood to Bassick,” she said. “The most direct route takes you along the highway, along the railroad, into industrial-zoned areas that are not pedestrian friendly at all, and they’re not even frequented by people. There’s barely any car traffic over there.” 
This fall, Bassick High School opened its newly constructed building. The old school is located roughly a mile away on Fairfield Avenue. Heilmann said the change made a difference. 
“This high school used to be centrally located in the middle of a neighborhood, and now it’s not. It’s far from all the neighborhoods that it’s zoned for,” she said. 
Heilmann also expressed concern about the distances that students in Bridgeport are expected to walk before they qualify for busing, saying that 2 miles is “ridiculously long,” particularly for high schoolers who might be walking in the dark, early morning hours. 
Another parent, Becky, who asked to be identified only by her first name in order to protect her daughter’s privacy, said her child is friends with the student who was assaulted. Becky said that her daughter used to walk less than 10 minutes to get to school at the Fairfield Avenue campus. 
Now that the school moved to the University of Bridgeport campus, she said, her daughter’s commute to school on foot is 40 minutes and 30 minutes on a bike. 
Becky said she disagreed with the new location of the school. 
“It’s a very high crime area. There’s a lot of drug addicts that hang out on the corners that she has to walk past every single day,” she said. “It’s not safe at all and there’s no crossing guards.” 
Becky said her daughter has been afraid to walk to school alone since her friend was assaulted, and that she’s been driving her back and forth. “It’s kind of hard with me, because I have to be in work by six and I really can’t drop her off at seven,” she said.
Leslie Caraballo, a former Democratic candidate for the Board of Education, told CT Mirror that she felt parents have been left in the dark about the incident.  
Like Heilmann, Caraballo said the new location of Bassick High School is in a more dangerous area than the Fairfield Avenue location, requiring students to walk underneath an underpass to get to the school. She disagrees with the policy change that would lengthen the walking distance to 2.5 miles.
“Just because they’re high schoolers does not mean anything. They’re still students. They’re still kids,” she said. 
She also criticized the Board of Education for cuts to school staff, like counselors, who could help students work through their feelings in the aftermath of the incident.  
“We have a serious situation going on and now we don’t even have people to handle the students properly to make sure that they’re okay,” she said. 
But Board of Education member Willie Medina disagreed that the assault had any connection to the new location of the school. Instead, he said it was a singular, isolated incident. 
“In a perfect world, do we want to have a crossing guard in every corner? Absolutely,” Medina said. But he added that high schoolers would have to walk the same streets whether they were attending Bassick High School in its former location or where it is currently located. 
Lawmakers who spoke to CT Mirror this week were hesitant when asked whether the state should create a statewide maximum walking distance for students.
State Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, a member of the education committee, said that while “obviously anything we can do to make sure we protect our young people from violence is important,” he wanted to make sure the facts of the assault are known before lawmakers consider drafting legislation to address the problem. 
Felipe noted that the state was able to supply Bridgeport Public Schools with enough funding to cover their transportation costs this year, and said he hopes the state will be able to continue that funding over the next few years. 
State Sen. Eric Berthel, R-Watertown, ranking member on the Education Committee, said he understood that further walking distances for students could lead to higher absenteeism, and said that busing students was “the safest thing to do.” 
But Berthel said he was concerned that creating a statewide walking distance maximum would force additional transportation costs onto the districts. 
“The reality is that we may have more of a Bridgeport problem than a problem that is affecting all of Connecticut,” Berthel said. 
Asked whether districts should be given more money to fund transportation, Berthel said the legislature needed to look more closely at costs and budgeting in the school districts before making the decision to allocate more money. He said the state has allocated more money per student in the largest urban districts than anywhere else in Connecticut. 
Bridgeport officials had nothing to say publicly about the issue this week. Communications officials for Bridgeport Public Schools referred questions to a spokesperson for the City of Bridgeport. That spokesperson, Shawnna White, said she could not comment on concerns about the distance students are walking or the school’s location.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BRIDGEPORT-SPED-COMPLAINT-0807-DE-006-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-16 18:03:14.654820

Ron DeSantis and Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia promising Floridians a chance to substantially reduce if not outright eliminate property taxes, eight Republican members of the Florida House filed legislation Thursday to achieve that goal.
All but one of the measures were filed as joint resolutions, meaning that if 3/5ths of the Legislature approves them in both chambers, they would appear on the 2026 statewide ballot, where they must get 60% support to become law.
All of the measures have language that specifically prohibits local governments from reducing funding for law enforcement. They all exempt school taxes. Property taxes comprise around 46% of school funding, according to the Florida Education Association.
Some are wider ranging than others, and it remains to be seen how many of these proposals will get through the Legislature and arrive on DeSantis’ desk. The governor said in Jacksonville earlier this month that if he isn’t particularly enamored by what the Legislature proposes, he could call a special session during the summer to address the issue.
He added it was important to write an amendment(s) in a manner “that resonates with people” and not “written in legislative, bureaucratic speak.”
House Speaker Daniel Perez said in a memo that the ultimate decision on what should happen doesn’t belong with elected officials, but the public at large.
“If we have faith in the voters to elect us, we should not be afraid to let them be a part of the conversation about the taxes they pay,” he said. “It is our position that the House does not need to limit itself in presenting one single plan, but instead allow the people of Florida the ability to choose some, all, or none of the proposals on the 2026 ballot.”
The most expansive measure is a joint resolution (HJR 201) sponsored by Republican Kevin Steele, R-Dade City, which would eliminate all non-school homestead property taxes.
A joint resolution (HJR 203) filed by Republican Monique Miller, R-Palm Bay, would phase out non-school homestead property taxes annually over ten years.
Miami-Dade Republican Juan Porras has filed a joint resolution (HJR 205) that would exempt Florida residents over the age of 65 from paying non-school homestead property taxes.
Florida law now allows up to $50,000 to be deducted from the assessed value of a primary or permanent residence. The first $25,000 of value is entirely exempt. The second $25,000 exemption applies to the value between $50,000-$75,000 and does not include a benefit on the school tax. Some of the proposals would provide additions to those homestead exemptions.
Rep. Shane Abbott, R-DeFuniak Springs, has filed a joint resolution (HJR 207) that would create a new homestead exemption for non-school property taxes equal to 25% of the assessed value of the House.
Rep. Demi Busatta, R-Miami Dade, has filed a joint resolution (HJR 209) that would create a new property insurance relief homestead exemption of $100,000 — as long as the property is covered by a comprehensive “multiperil” property insurance policy.
Under Florida’s Save Our Homes benefit, the maximum amount of a portability transfer from a single homestead is $500,000. However under a proposal (HJR 211) filed by Rep. Toby Overdorf, R-Palm City, that cap on portability would be eliminated, allowing a homeowner to transfer their entire accumulated Save Our Homes benefit to their new home, even if that home has a lesser value.
Overdorf is co-chair of the House Select Committee on Property Taxes, formed by Speaker Perez earlier this year to craft potential constitutional amendments on property tax reduction.
Rep. Philip “Griff” Griffitts, R-Panama City Beach, has filed a joint resolution (HJR 213) to limit the growth in assessed value of non-school homestead property to 3% over three years (it’s now 3% per year) and 15% over three years for non-homestead property (it’s 10% per year now).
The only bill filed to address property tax reduction that would only need to pass the Legislature and get signed by the governor to become law is a measure (HB 215) filed by Rep. Jon Albert, R-Frostproof, that would make various statutory changes including requiring a 2/3 vote for any increase in the millage rate by a local government and allow newly married couples to combined their accumulated Save Our Homes benefits, not exceeding a total of $500,000.
Perez noted that the joint resolutions won’t have “accompanying implementing legislation,” meaning there would be no need for the Legislature to do anything more. But he did say that decisions “should be made by the Legislature once they know which proposals have been approved by the voters and can devise an appropriate statutory framework that accounts for how the various provisions might work together.”

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)A federal judge in Missoula dismissed a youth-led climate change lawsuit challenging several presidential executive orders on the grounds the district court did not have jurisdiction to provide the sweeping relief asked for by the plaintiffs. 
Judge Dana Christensen on Wednesday issued an order “reluctantly” dismissing Lighthiser v. Trump, saying the scope of the requests made by 22 young people seeking relief from fossil fuel-driven climate change was “an unworkable request.”
“While this Court is certainly troubled by the very real harms presented by climate change and the Challenged EOs’ effect on carbon dioxide emissions, this concern does not automatically confer upon it the power to act,” Christensen wrote. 
Granting the plaintiffs request to roll back executive orders and subsequent agency actions would require the court to “monitor an untold number of federal agency actions to determine whether they contravene its injunction,” the order wrote. “This is, quite simply, an unworkable request.”
Lighthiser v. Trump is the latest of a series of youth-led climate change lawsuits brought by Our Children’s Trust, an Oregon-based advocacy law firm. 
Judges at the federal level have similarly dismissed other cases brought by the organization, namely Juliana v. United States, which Christensen cited extensively in his order. 
But other state-focused cases with youth plaintiffs have been successful. In 2023, a district court judge in Montana ruled in favor of plaintiffs in Held v. Montana, which found Montanans have a constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment that is infringed on if the state ignores potential impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. Youth won another case in Hawaii against that state’s Department of Transportation. 
Plaintiffs from Juliana and Held, along with youth from Florida, California, Hawaii and Oregon, joined together in Lighthiser to sue the Trump administration over the president’s executive orders aimed at supporting the fossil fuel industry, curbing renewable energy and suppressing climate science.
During a two-day hearing in September, attorneys for the plaintiffs argued for an injunction against the three orders, as well as an order halting roughly a dozen federal agencies from implementing any policies related to the orders. 
Meanwhile, the Justice Department, backed by several states including Montana, which joined the lawsuit, argued Christensen should dismiss the case, saying plaintiffs lacked standing and were asking the court to set federal environmental policy. 
“It’s unprecedented,” federal attorney Michael Sawyer said during the hearing. “There is no basis in law for stepping in and going back,” to a previous administration’s policies. 
Several youth plaintiffs testified to the harms they suffer from climate change, including increased experiences with environmental disasters, respiratory issues exacerbated by wildfires and heat waves, and concerns that their future families and careers could be jeopardized by federal actions. 
 In addition, many expert witnesses testified as well, including Steven Running, a renowned climate scientist who said every additional ton of greenhouse gas emissions would hasten climate change, and the plaintiffs’ injuries.

In his order, Christensen said the court was presented with “overwhelming evidence that the climate is changing at a staggering pace, and that this change stems from the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide, caused by the production and burning of fossil fuels.”
The court record, he wrote “demonstrates that climate change and the exposure from fossil fuels presents a children’s health emergency,” and that implementing Trump’s executive orders “will increase the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide, thereby exacerbating the harms plaintiffs experience from an already-warming climate.”
But despite his findings that the plaintiffs adequately showed they have injuries that can be concretely traced to increased fossil fuel production as sought by the federal government, their requests for relief exceeded the court’s authority, a concern he had raised during the hearing.
“At the heart of Plaintiffs’ request is that the Court wind back the clock to the regulatory framework that existed on January 19, 2025,” Christensen wrote. 
And while preventing an estimated 205 million metric tons of annual greenhouse gas emissions tied to the executive orders is enough to consider addressing the complaint, Christensen said it would be nearly impossible to “scrutinize every climate-related agency action taken” by the federal government to determine if it was following an injunction. 
“Plaintiffs effectively seek to enjoin not just three executive orders, but also tens — if not hundreds — of policy decisions, regulations and projects promulgated by 12 Federal agencies,” he wrote. “Plaintiffs’ request effectively amounts to hundreds of lawsuits being brought in a single case.”
Julia Olson, chief legal counsel at Our Children’s Trust, said the legal team would appeal Christensen’s decision. 
“Every day these executive orders remain in effect, these 22 young Americans suffer irreparable harm to their health, safety, and future. The judge recognized that the government’s fossil fuel directives are injuring these youth, but said his hands were tied by precedent,” Olson said in a press release. “We will appeal—because courts cannot offer more protection to fossil fuel companies seeking to preserve their profits than to young Americans seeking to preserve their rights. This violates not only the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent, but the most basic principles of justice.“

The Montana Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. 
The Lighthiser suit named Trump as a defendant along with 11 federal agencies and their respective agency heads, including the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency and NASA.

The Conservation Law Foundation filed a notice of intent to sue the Vorsteveld Farm for pesticides flowing into Dead Creek and Lake Champlain.

A major dairy in Addison County learned on Thursday that a pair of environmental nonprofits intended to sue the farm for violating the federal Clean Water Act.
The nonprofits alleged Vorsteveld Farm, a concentrated animal feeding operation in Panton, has poured pesticides directly into Dead Creek, a tributary of Lower Otter Creek and Lake Champlain, according to the notice of intent to sue, but did not have a legally required federal pollution permit for those discharges. The chemicals from the farm have exceeded state and federal safety standards and could be harmful to human and environmental health, the notice alleged.
The dairy, owned by brothers Gerard, Hans and Rudy Vorsteveld, has 60 days to respond. If they don’t voluntarily take actions to clean up its operations and cease the alleged pollution of Vermont’s waterways, the Conservation Law Foundation, an advocacy group in New England that filed the notice along with the Vermont Natural Resources Council, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting Vermont’s environment, could file a formal lawsuit. 
“Our state economy heavily depends on the health of our waterways, and no farm should be allowed to pollute at these exceptionally high levels,” said Lauren Hierl, executive director of the Vermont Natural Resources Council, in a press statement. 
Gerard Vorsteveld did not respond to a phone call from VTDigger by the time of publication.
Claudine Safar, an attorney who represents the Vorstevelds, said she and her clients didn’t have adequate time to review the notice to comment on Thursday.
Vijay Nazareth, the executive director of the Champlain Valley Farmer Coalition, a farmer advocacy group that includes Vorsteveld Farm, said in an email that it was too early to comment on the impact the notice could have on the farm or the farming community.

Vorsteveld Farm has almost 3,000 cows that annually produce almost 20 million gallons of liquid manure and waste. Some of that waste is stored in lagoons before it’s spread on almost 300 acres of cropland, including corn and soybeans, according to the farm’s permit application to expand. In July, the state approved a permit to expand the farm by almost 600 cows, adding more than 6 million gallons of manure to its waste stream every year.
The manure, pesticides and fertilizer can move underground through an extensive series of pipes installed beneath the cropland. The system, known as tile drains, can work to empty water from fields faster.  Such systems are implemented to conserve farmland and water quality under the Natural Resources Conservation Service, a federal agency dedicated to conserving natural resources through agricultural practices. But pollutants applied to the surface can also drain out into the water. Outfall pipes from those drainage systems discharge into Dead Creek and other waters, the organizations allege.  
The argument could be an uphill battle for the environmental nonprofits after a September decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals determined that water discharged through agricultural drains were exempt from federal permitting requirements.
“That 9th circuit decision is not applicable to the facts here,” Elena Mihaly, vice president of the Conservation Law Foundation, said in a text.
The state was actively reviewing the notice, Julie Moore, secretary for the Agency of Natural Resources, said on Thursday. 
“To my knowledge, this is a pretty novel argument in Vermont that CLF has raised regarding the management and regulation of tile drainage,” Moore said.
Since April 2024, the nonprofits spent two years working with Burlington-based engineering firm VHB to collect 92 water samples from public access points to the Vorsteveld pipes. According to the notice, 99 percent of those samples contained clothianidin, a neonicotinoid insecticide that can hurt pollinator populations, at concentrations exceeding the EPA’s safety benchmark. Atrazine, an herbicide linked to birth defects and cancers, according to the notice, was found in concentrations that are 50 times higher than what the EPA considers safe for drinking water. 
The Conservation Law Foundation has never sued the Vorstevelds before, but the farm faced a previous lawsuit by neighbors who were concerned about the impact of the farm on local water quality. After the state Supreme Court found the farm failed to reduce runoff onto a neighbor’s land, the court also found the brothers in contempt of court by failing to reduce pollution in May. 
“Unregulated pollution poses a grave risk to people, plants, and wildlife in our communities,” Mihaly wrote in a press statement. “No one should have to worry that a major agricultural operation next door is poisoning their water.”
The farm is also facing an ongoing case from the Environmental Protection Agency alleging that, when the Vorstevelds ripped up their fields to install the tile drains, they failed to secure a permit to fill a federally protected wetland on their property. 
The notice letter is meant to begin the conversation with the Vorstevelds, Mihaly said Thursday. The nonprofits want the farm to join them, and likely the state, in finding a solution: likely applying for coverage under a Clean Water Act permit. 
Vermont’s Agency of Natural Resources was subject to an earlier complaint by the Conservation Law Foundation that alleged the state was failing to enforce the Clean Water Act. The complaint led to enforcement actions from the Environmental Protection Agency. The state now has to fix the way it monitors farms that are considered concentrated animal feeding operations, and the agency is working to shore up their permit program for large farms like the Vorstevelds. Such a permit for a concentrated animal feeding operation could draw down the farm’s pollution over time, Mihaly said.
But the law foundation had no indication that those permits would include regulations for discharges from these particular pipes at this particular farm, Mihaly said. Without those assurances, the nonprofit decided to bring its own enforcement action. 
“The legal amount of pollution is zero without a permit,” Mihaly said. She said the law foundation was not currently looking into legal challenges at any other farms.

Rhode Island is now poised to lose 20 buoys, rather than 37, under a revised plan unveiled by the Coast Guard in September. Across the Northeast, the maritime agency is looking to remove 233 buoys from federal waters, down from an original 350.
The Coast Guard will add lighting and sound signals to nearly one-third of those still slated to be discontinued to help reduce negative impacts for mariners. 
The Coast Guard maintains roughly 400 buoys across Rhode Island. The buoys targeted for removal in the revised plan are identified online in an interactive map.

The Coast Guard billed the removal of navigational markers as an embrace of modern technology, targeting the oldest buoys that were put in place before modern GPS systems. But mariners, environmental groups and lawmakers, including U.S. Sen Jack Reed, criticized the cuts, which they said could compromise safety for boaters who rely on the markers in bad weather, and when GPS systems are unavailable.
Reed touted the results of public feedback in a statement on Thursday, while urging affected mariners to continue to write in during a reopened public comment period.
“Rhode Islanders know these waters best and their voices have already made a difference,” Reed said. “Because of strong public participation earlier this year, the Coast Guard scaled back its removal list by nearly half. That shows how important it is for mariners, fishermen, and harbor officials to speak up again.  Even during a government shutdown, this comment window is open — and every perspective matters.”
The U.S. Coast Guard will continue to accept written public comments on its navigation plan changes through Nov. 15. 
Coast Guard officials specifically would like those providing feedback to indicate “the size and type of your vessel, how you use the buoys to navigate and the distance at which you start looking for and using it.”

Don Davis (D-N.C.) (Source: ncleg.gov)Republican legislative leaders in North Carolina unveiled a mid-decade redistricting proposal aimed at drawing out Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C.) ahead of an expected vote next week.
Under the current map, Davis’s 1st District voted Democratic in the 2020 presidential race by a little over 1%. The new map redraws it to create a district that voted roughly 55% Republican to 44% Democratic in the 2024 presidential election — putting him at a more than 10 percentage point deficit.
U.S. Rep. Don Davis (Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)
This represents Republicans’ second attempt to draw Davis out, after a new map drawn in 2023 changed his district to one that voted 52% to 46% in favor of Republicans in the 2022 U.S. Senate campaign. But Davis still won reelection in 2024 by a margin of about 50% to 48%.
Under the new map, the 11th Congressional District held by Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-N.C.) is set to become the closest in the state, with a margin of just under 54% Republican votes to 44% Democratic in the 2024 presidential race. It would be the only district in the state decided by less than 10% of the vote, leaving North Carolina with no swing districts.
Davis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The map comes three days after House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) and Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) announced an agreement to draw up a new map, responding to President Donald Trump’s call to Republicans across the country to eliminate Democratic seats wherever possible to help maintain Republican control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms.
“President Trump earned a clear mandate from the voters of North Carolina and the rest of the country, and we intend to defend it by drawing an additional Republican Congressional seat,” Hall said in a statement Monday.

“The #NCGA is ready to help Republicans secure Congress and move @realDonaldTrump’s agenda forward!” Berger wrote in a statement on social media after the map’s release Thursday.
Democratic leaders in the state and around the country have condemned the move as antidemocratic. House Democratic Leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) called it “stealing a congressional district” while Gov. Josh Stein said Monday that the state’s Republicans are “failing you, the voters.”
“These shameless politicians are abusing their power to take away yours. I will always fight for you because the voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around,” Stein said in a statement.
Hall’s office stated in a press release announcing public comment has opened on the map that both the House and Senate expect to consider it next week. Only a simple majority is required to pass the new map, which Republicans easily hold in both chambers, and it is not subject to the governor’s veto — rendering the map’s passage a foregone conclusion.

(Getty Images)Despite facing no challengers thus far in his 2026 re-election campaign, Attorney General Raúl Torrez, a Democrat, raised over $385,000 between April and September, according to the latest campaign filings.
His total campaign haul so far ranks third in the state, according to the New Mexico Secretary of State’s office, behind the two Democratic frontrunners in the gubernatorial primary: former U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland and Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman, who have already raised millions.
Including $114,000 from his first election in 2022, Torrez has more than $622,000 cash on hand, which includes 800 individual donations in the past year. His top donors include Brady Lovelady, the Perfection Honda dealer based in Rio Rancho; The New Beginnings, which offers residential and other care for people with disabilities based in Albuquerque; and the Parnall Law Firm.
Statewide candidates’ most recent campaign reports in advance of the June 2, 2026 primary election were due Oct. 14. They won’t file again until next year.
Lieutenant governor
So far, three Democratic candidates and one Republican have declared candidacies to become the lieutenant governor. The position is both the state’s second-in-command to step in when the governor is absent and to oversee the New Mexico State Senate during legislative sessions.
Stephanie Garcia Richard, a Democrat and the outgoing New Mexico commissioner of public lands, raised $165,000 from more than 450 individual donors.
“I’m proud and grateful for the outpouring of support,” Garcia Richard said in a statement to Source NM.
Her largest donors include the Fort Sill Apache Tribe, which entered into a land exchange with the state for ancestral lands near Luna County in 2022; Los Alamos resident Karyl Armbruster, a former commissioner on the Public Education Commissioner; and Vicki Gottlieb, an IT consultant from Placitas.
Garcia Richard loaned $5,000 to the campaign and her husband Eric Vasquez lent it another $2,000. She entered the race with $32,000 cash on hand.
Albuquerque Democratic New Mexico State Sen. Harold Pope reported just over $7,000 in donations from just over 50 donors.
Voters reelected Pope to a second term in November to represent Albuquerque’s far northwest side.
Earlier this year, Pope transferred just over $10,000 from his senate reelection campaign. His top donors include fellow Democrat Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez from Albuquerque; and Christopher Jones, a salesperson from Powder Springs, Georgia.
The third Democratic candidate, Loving Village Councilor Jackie Lee Onsurez, reported $350 in total donations from three contributors in September: Joy Bordenave in Alamogordo; Rosie Garcia in Artesia; and Moses Ayoub in El Paso, Texas.
Manny Lardzibal, the only declared Republican candidate so far, reported more than $6,700 in contributions from 16 donors since April. He self-funded nearly half of that with $3,200 in loans to his campaign. His other top donors include Fulcrum Contracting, a Las Cruces-based contracting company; and Hudson, New Mexico retirees David and Gloria Chapman.
Secretary of State
Current Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, a Democrat, has served two consecutive terms and cannot run for re-election. So far, three Democrats are vying to replace her. No Republican candidates, as yet, have entered the race.
Rocking the Vote

Amanda López Askin, the Democratic Doña Ana county clerk, reported nearly $147,000 in campaign contributions from more than 600 donors.
Her top donors include Antonia Roybal Mac, an Albuquerque attorney; San Marcos, Texas resident Vina Turner; and the election committee for Albuquerque Democratic Sen. Katy Duhigg.
Katharine Clark, the Democratic Santa Fe county clerk, reported raising more than $81,000 from nearly 900 donors. Her top donors included Laraine Clark, a retiree in Santa Fe; lobbying firm JD Bullington Governmental Relations; and Placitas IT consultant Vicki Gottlieb.
Sonya Smith, a veteran and former New Mexico cabinet member for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, reported contributions of just over $10,000 since April from just over 100 donors. Her largest donors included Dewayne Wilcher, a Maryland sales representative; and Virginia State Sen. Angelia Williams Graves. Nearly half of the 47 donors lived in either Maryland or Virginia. Smith, a Democrat, returned to her home state in Virginia to care for her mother in 2022, and returned to New Mexico recently.
Land Commissioner
Juan Sanchez, a former natural resource specialist for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and consultant for the New Mexico Acequia Commission, led the three Democratic candidates in total funds raised in his campaign for state commissioner of public lands. Garcia Richard, the current land commissioner, is termed limited from running for the office again.
Sanchez reported $120,000 in campaign contributions from nearly 400 contributors. All four of his top donors donated the campaign limit maximum of $6,200: New York real estate developer Greg Manocherian; Kennen and Jonathan Bruser from Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Jacob Bracken, a real estate manager in St. George, Utah.
Democratic Rep. Matthew McQueen (Galisteo) reported just over 300 donations totaling more than $88,000 since April. His largest donors included Alan McQueen, a retired financial advisor in Ranchos Palos Verdes, California; Lynne Horning, a Washington, DC arts education advocate and philanthropist; and Margaret Detwiler, a Santa Fe retiree.
Jonas Moya, a rancher from Tucumcari and former Biden-appointed state director for the Farm Service Agency, reported nearly 150 donors that contributed $22,000 since April. His top donors include Scott Goodman, an Albuquerque realtor; Corey Rivas, an Albuquerque-based campaign consultant; and Peralta-based consulting firm founder Lily Vitela.
Michael Jack Perry, the only declared Republican so far, reported receiving more than $37,000 from nearly 50 donors.
His top donors included Roswell car dealership owner Thomas Krumland – who, according to the documents, donated $12,400, which would exceed campaign limits for non-gubernatorial candidates.
Perry told Source NM that the donation from Krumland came from a joint account with his wife and included the maximum donation of $6,200 from each of them.
“I have a treasurer looking at the records, and I certainly wouldn’t want to do anything inappropriate,” he told Source NM.
A voicemail left at Krumland’s office went unreturned Thursday. An email requesting comment from the Secretary of State’s office remained pending Thursday.
Independent candidate Destiny Mitchel reported no expenses or contributions to her campaign so far. Mitchell is a current Truth or Consequences city commissioner whose term expires in 2026.

Jeff Landry’s call for enhanced security earlier this week.  Interim LSU President Matt Lee did […],"Clouds pass over Tiger Stadium on Monday, March 20, 2023, on LSU’s campus in Baton Rouge, La.LSU announced an increase in police presence on campus for football games and the use of drones to monitor tailgates in response to on-campus shooting on two game days this season.  
The measures were announced Thursday in response to Gov. Jeff Landry’s call for enhanced security earlier this week. 
Interim LSU President Matt Lee did not specify how many more law enforcement officers will be on patrol, saying that more information would be released next week. LSU hosts Texas A&M on Oct. 25 in what will be a midafternoon or night game at Tiger Stadium. 
Lee and LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard also did not provide information regarding how much the increased security or drone presence would cost, who would be responsible for the bill or which police agency will monitor the drone footage. 
Baton Rouge Police said at least two people exchanged gunfire near Highland Road and Dalrymple Drive as the homecoming game against South Carolina took place Saturday, resulting in minor injuries to two men. A 16-year-old has been arrested in connection with the shooting and charged with attempted first-degree murder, bringing a firearm to a school campus and illegal use of a weapon.
Before Saturday’s game, police said a Jefferson Parish man accidentally shot himself in the leg on South Stadium Drive. Lawrence Hubbard, 18, was arrested after being treated at a hospital and charged with illegal use of a weapon and bringing a firearm on campus.
During the Sept. 13 game against Florida, police responded to shots fired near LSU’s law school. The incident remains under investigation.
Other security measures planned for LSU’s next home game include shutting down an unspecified section of Highland Road. 
Unity Field, a tailgating area at the northeast corner of the intersection of Highland Road and South Stadium Drive, will be fenced off to all tailgates as a result of the violence, Lee said. The area has historically been the gathering spot of Black Greek organizations and other Black student groups. 
“This isn’t about race. This is about place,” Lee said. “We’ve had a place that has been the source of significant problems for us, and so in advisement with law enforcement and with my own cabinet, we decide that we’ll fence that place off.” 
Lee said the shootings have been traced to a student organization tailgate that gave inaccurate information on their request for tailgate permits. The student organization will be subject to discipline, though Lee declined to name the group.
Ballard said the university will also use the increased law enforcement presence to police nonviolent offenses to improve the game-day experience. Anyone caught smoking marijuana at the stadium will be ejected, he said. If they are season ticket holders, they will be prohibited from attending the next game, and anyone caught with illegal amounts of marijuana on campus will be arrested, he added.  
“It’s just an overall sense of disorder that we have to tamp down on, because our priority is a premier game day experience,” Ballard said. 
Lee would not address whether LSU would accept assistance from the Louisiana National Guard if they are deployed in Baton Rouge. Last month, the governor requested President Donald Trump’s support to activate the Guard to address crime in Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Alexandria and Shreveport. 
“I’m not going to speak to that at this moment,” Lee said. “Where we’re working right now is with local and state law enforcement agencies. We’re going to implement that on campus for the next game, and then we’ll see where we go from there.”

(Kevin Mohatt for Colorado Newsline)Colorado election experts say the state will continue to have “gold standard” elections after a former Republican election official purchased Dominion Voting Systems, which provides voting machines in most Colorado counties. 
Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican elections director in St. Louis, purchased Denver-based Dominion and renamed the company Liberty Vote. 
“Liberty Vote is committed to delivering election technology that prioritizes paper-based transparency, security, and simplicity so that voters can be assured that every ballot is filled-in accurately and fairly counted,” Leiendecker said in a statement.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The press release announcing the transition emphasized Liberty Vote’s commitment to election integrity, full American ownership, a focus on paper ballots, and third-party auditing, using language that aligns with so-called election integrity efforts centered around the false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.  
It also said the company will prioritize compliance with President Donald Trump’s executive order on elections, which election experts have said is unconstitutional and has been preemptively blocked by the courts. 
Matt Crane, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association, said Colorado elections will look exactly the same as they have following the change of ownership and that Leiendecker assured him the company does not plan to start from scratch. Dominion has changed ownership and changed names several times before, Crane said. 
“We have multiple safeguards in place to make sure that the voting systems are functioning properly and are audited properly,” Crane said. “The product … in counties now, formerly Dominion, now Liberty Vote, is a really, really solid voting system, and nothing’s going to change from that.” 
Of Colorado’s 64 counties, 60 use Dominion voting machines, Crane said. 
Clerks didn’t know about sale 
Colorado law allows counties to change their election equipment providers if they have the money to do it, as Crane said it is a costly process. But he doesn’t anticipate a “mass exodus” away from the Liberty Vote machines following the change in ownership. The timing of the announcement is unfortunate given county clerks are in the middle of administering the 2025 election, Crane said, and they are all still learning about the new company. 
Jack Todd, spokesperson for Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, said her office is “monitoring this development” and looks forward to “continuing Colorado’s gold standard elections.” Crane said Griswold is likely trying to gather information and learn about the new company just like the county clerks are. 
A handful of clerks spoke with Leiendecker in a call Friday, and all Colorado clerks were invited to a larger call with him Monday. Crane said he appreciates that Leiendecker committed time to address concerns from Colorado election officials after they learned about the new company in charge of their election equipment. 
Crane told Leiendecker that he wished election officials knew about the sale before it was publicly announced. 
“If there’s an absence of official information, then the disinformation vacuum is just going to go crazy, and that’s what happened here,” Crane said. “So it should have been, they reached out to us first before going public, and hopefully that’s something that in future communications that they will improve upon.”
That disinformation included claims that Leiendecker is “MAGA,” or aligned with Trump and his administration’s priorities, and that he is an election denier, Crane said. 
Affiliation with Logan Circle Group
Denver Clerk and Recorder Paul López, a Democrat whose elections division uses Dominion voting machines, said he had concerns because of the language in the statement announcing the sale and because of Leiendecker’s affiliation with the Logan Circle Group, a conservative public relations firm. He said the firm’s proximity to the Trump administration and election denialism is what gives him “some pause.” 
“It seemed to validate these debunked election conspiracies,” López said about the announcement. “That’s concerning to me when people use that language.”










Trump’s executive orders are bombastic, and they’re bombastic because of the fact that states run elections. Those executive orders fly in the face of the Constitution, they’re not constitutional.


– Paul López, Denver clerk and recorder


Election officials have been vilified and targeted by “MAGA extremists” the firm represents who believe the 2020 election was stolen, López said. But Leiendecker was sympathetic to the concerns López presented him related to the firm and the commitment to abide by Trump’s executive order. 
“I said I just want to make sure that this move isn’t a move that’s going to compromise our model here, or isn’t going to roll over every time the federal government puts out an executive order,” López said. “Trump’s executive orders are bombastic, and they’re bombastic because of the fact that states run elections. Those executive orders fly in the face of the Constitution, they’re not constitutional.” 
Claims of widespread fraud in recent U.S. elections have been debunked by elections officials, experts, media investigations, law enforcement, and the courts.
Third-party audits
Election deniers who have targeted Dominion will continue those actions even with the change in ownership, Crane said, because those who believe conspiracy theories about the 2020 election “don’t care about fact” and are “willing to steal and cheat to get different political outcomes or policy outcomes.” 
“I think Jesus Christ could come down himself and take ownership of this company and they wouldn’t care,” Crane said. “These people, they don’t care about facts. They don’t care about data. They only care about what their desired outcomes are.” 
Despite his concerns about the new ownership, López said he is still confident in Colorado’s election system, because vendors alone cannot alter a county’s election machines, and those machines have no internet connection. He told Leiendecker that he will explore other vendors for Denver’s election equipment if he starts to see “any kind of change that would compromise the integrity of our elections or trust in our elections.”
“My concern is just making sure that voters have trust in the American electoral system,” López said. “Anything that would come to threaten that or violate that, we don’t want any part of that.”










I think Jesus Christ could come down himself and take ownership of this company and they wouldn’t care ... These people, they don’t care about facts.


– Matt Crane, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association


Mesa County Clerk and Recorder Bobbie Gross, a Republican, said she has concerns about third-party auditing, continuation of existing contracts, potential decertification of elections equipment and accessibility under the new company. Leiendecker told clerks on Monday that he plans to use “reputable, independent testing labs such as Idaho National Labs and SLI Compliance,” Gross said. She said existing contracts with Dominion will not change, Colorado does not use any outdated equipment that could be up for decertification, and equipment will continue to comply with Americans with Disabilities Act requirements. 
Colorado voters should see no difference in how local elections are run, Gross said, and Mesa County has no need to replace or update its current equipment. She said the primary change in the sale is the name of the company. 
“If any software updates are introduced in the future, they must first undergo state and federal certification before being implemented,” Gross said in a statement. “It is important for voters to know that every piece of equipment is thoroughly tested with a representative from both major political parties before each election and we audit the elections after to ensure accuracy and integrity.”
The third-party audits Leiendecker plans to implement mirror the current state testing process that ensures the machines’ software works properly, Crane said. They won’t be anything like the dubious Cyber Ninjas “audit” in Arizona following the 2020 election, Crane said.
All paper ballots 
Aly Belknap, executive director of Colorado Common Cause, said state laws and processes put in place by the secretary of state and county clerks govern elections in Colorado, and a vendor cannot change that. 
“The vendor doesn’t determine the type of equipment we use, how voters cast their ballots, and how those ballots are audited,” Belknap said in a statement. “Colorado voters should continue to have confidence in our elections process. Voters rightfully expect that elections will be run fairly — regardless of who is in office or who is on the ballot.”
The clerk’s association has been cynical about Trump’s executive order, Crane said, but in the call with Colorado clerks Leiendecker “made clear that he was talking about the voting systems part” of the order, which Crane said Colorado is already in compliance with because it uses all paper ballots that don’t have barcodes on them. Gross also said Colorado “already meets or exceeds many of the standards” outlined in Trump’s executive order.
“Our focus remains unchanged, we are committed to conducting fair, (secure), accurate and accessible elections for every eligible Colorado voter,” Gross said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-16 20:45:22+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT rejects controversial UI monopoles plan in Fairfield, Bridgeport",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/16/monopoles-denied-ct-siting-council-united-illuminating/,The CT Siting Council voted 5-3 to reject United Illuminating's application to build the Fairfield to Congress Railroad Transmission Line.,"A contentious plan to erect a new high-voltage transmission line through sections of Bridgeport and Fairfield was rejected by state regulators on Thursday, an unexpected victory for critics who argued the project would be a towering blight over homes, businesses and churches.
The Connecticut Siting Council — which has the authority over the placement of power plants, transmission lines and other critical infrastructure — voted 5-3 to reject United Illuminating’s application to build its proposed Fairfield to Congress Railroad Transmission Line.
The decision marked the latest twist in the years-long saga over the project, which has been subject to a lawsuit and unsuccessful efforts to get UI to agree to a costlier design that would bury the transmission line underground.
In September, the Siting Council held a non-binding straw poll in which a majority of members signaled their intent to support UI’s application. That was a reversal of the council’s previous stance in June, when a majority of members voted to oppose the project.
There was little public discussion among council members on Thursday to shed light on why several members changed their minds.
The only member who spoke, Brian Golembiewski, said he supported an alternative route previously developed by the Siting Council which has been rejected by the courts.
“This is a tremendous win for Fairfield and Bridgeport, and for every resident who showed up, spoke up, and worked tirelessly in opposition to a project that was damaging to the very foundations of our community,” Fairfield First Selectman Christine Vitale said in a statement. “The Siting Council listened to the people of our communities, and was convinced by the irrefutable facts that this was a flawed design.”
Gov. Ned Lamont, who stepped into the controversy last month by urging the two sides to work out a compromise, also voiced support for the council’s decision to reject UI’s proposal for an overhead line. 
“Our hope is an alternative plan will be presented that minimizes the impacts to these communities while strengthening the reliability of our grid and protects rate payers,” Lamont spokesman Rob Blanchard said in a statement.
A spokesperson for United Illuminating was not immediately available to comment on the decision. 
Prior to the vote on Thursday, local opponents of the project in Fairfield and Bridgeport filed a letter with the Siting Council seeking a 6-month delay in order to allow for more time to attempt to negotiate with the utility over an alternative route. Those talks began last month at Lamont’s urging.
In their letter, however, representatives from the two towns accused UI of being unwilling to negotiate during meetings to discuss potential alternatives.
Bruce L. McDermott, an attorney for UI, rejected that characterization in his own letter to the Siting Council, saying it was was the towns that had failed to put forward their own ideas. That letter asked the Siting Council to reject the proposed delay and proceed with a final vote.
“It is UI’s position that in the more than two years since the application was filed with the Council that the Town and City have failed to present a design alternative that achieves one of the main purposes of the Public Utility Environmental Standards Act: to balance the need for adequate and reliable public utility company services, including electric transmission, at the lowest reasonable cost, with the protection of environmental resources and to minimize damage to scenic, historic and recreational values,” McDermott said in the letter.
Much of the criticism of the project focused on the visual impact of the proposed transmission line, which would have been suspended from steel monopoles up to 195 ft. high. UI’s existing transmission lines in the area are attached to support structures above the Metro-North railroad tracks that officials say are in need of replacement.
The company’s proposed 7.3-mile route for the Fairfield-Congress project would shift the line south of the railroad tracks before crossing parts of Bridgeport’s South End, where it would pass by several churches and historic buildings, including the city’s Freeman Houses.
“These are very dense communities,” said David Scott Parker, an architect whose office in Fairfield’s Southport neighborhood is situated directly in the path of the proposed wires. 
“This line is not going through, you know, a field somewhere where it had no impact,” he added. “It’s hard to imagine anything that would be more impactful than this.”
Burying the transmission lines would add up to $500 million to the project’s existing $300 million price tag, according to estimates provided by UI. Critics argued that the utility’s figures were significantly inflated compared to similar projects.
Under rules established by the regional electric grid, ISO New England, costs associated with building overhead transmission lines can be spread across the nearly 14 million electric customers in the six-state region. If a decision by a state’s siting agencies forces those lines to be buried, however, the additional costs are borne by electric customers in that state alone.
UI did not immediately say Thursday whether it would appeal the Siting Council’s decision, seek some alternative route or abandon the project altogether.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tranmsission_line.jpeg,,,2025-10-16 17:03:30.608618

Andy Beshear. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear has joined elected Democrats from other states in suing the Trump administration to stop what they call the  “unlawful termination” of billions of dollars for residential solar projects. 
A press release Wednesday from California Attorney General Rob Bonta stated the cancellation of the $7 billion “Solar for All” program denied states “critical funds they were depending on for solar energy in low-income and disadvantaged communities nationwide.” 
Bonta is among more than a dozen Democratic attorneys general, along with Beshear and Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who are plaintiffs in the lawsuits alleging the program’s termination is illegal and unconstitutional.  
When the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency terminated the program in August, Administrator Lee Zeldin in a statement on social media said the agency’s authority to administer the program was eliminated through the passage of a tax-and-spending law signed by Trump this summer. The Associated Press reported Zeldin characterized the program as a “boondoggle.” 
An email received Thursday from the EPA’s press office stated the agency doesn’t comment on pending litigation.
 Congress created the “Solar for All” program through the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, and the program aimed to expand residential solar energy projects to hundreds of thousands of low-income households across the country. 
Kentucky officials planned to use a portion of $62 million from the program to install residential solar panels paired with battery storage systems on homes in “disaster-impacted communities.” A group of stakeholders had met several times this year in planning how the state would use the funding in communities affected by floods and tornadoes.
Robin Hartman, a spokesperson for the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, in an early September email to the Lantern said the state couldn’t access its “Solar for All” funding because it  was being “unlawfully withheld by the federal administration.” 
“Team Kentucky is working hard to ensure the federal government makes good on its promise to our people and delivers the entirety of this funding,” Hartman wrote in her email.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_0351-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-16 17:03:30.608618

As the federal government pushes more disaster recovery responsibilities onto states, they are “sitting ducks” for contractors.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  How Vermont lost track of millions in FEMA flood recovery funds.","This story was first published by Grist. 
On the afternoon of August 21, Jason Gosselin raised the alarm: The flood recovery project he managed was running out of money faster than he had anticipated. One email he sent his colleagues ended with an anxious parenthetical: (calm down, Jason, calm down).
In July 2024, Vermont was hit by 100-year flooding for the second summer in a row. Among the aid that the Federal Emergency Management Agency approved was a $2.9 million grant to hire an 11-person disaster case management team to help victims navigate their FEMA applications, find other available resources, and rebuild their homes. The money was supposed to last two years but was on pace to be gone far sooner. The morning after his first email, Gosselin, who is the emergency management director at the Vermont Agency of Human Services, sent another message detailing the likely source of the unexpected financial drain. The corporate contractor Vermont used to hire the team, he calculated, was actually billing nearly half of the budget for its own staff.  
“We cannot / will not be able to support this,” concluded Gosselin. According to documents obtained by Grist, Gosselin was right — and the problem was even worse than he seemed to realize.


Records show the state kept about $400,000 for hiring its own administrative staff. The rest — $2.5 million — was allocated to Guidehouse, a multinational consulting company, to hire the frontline workers. But Guidehouse only subcontracted seven people, instead of 11, for $1.1 million. That left more than a million dollars that the company could use toward its own services.
“There is a huge need in the state,” said Prem Linskey, the case management supervisor at a local Vermont aid group, the Recovery After Floods Team. The amount of work is often untenable, with so many people that need help. “The state’s case management plan could have been much more effective if they had hired more people.”
A state official told Grist the program cost more than expected to get started, and it has since reined in costs. But although Vermont’s grant is relatively small compared to the billions of dollars that FEMA doles out each year, experts say the poor state oversight, vague contract terms, and high-priced consultants that accompanied it are unfortunately common. Cracks like these are only set to widen as climate change fuels extreme weather and President Donald Trump’s administration pushes more response and recovery responsibilities onto states that, too often, lack experience, expertise, and capacity. And if a federal grant is mishandled, it’s usually not FEMA or the contractor holding the bill but the state — and the stakes can be enormous.

Late last month, FEMA sent Gosselin and his team an informal yet stern email warning what would happen if they didn’t correct course. “Deficiencies can result in a range of consequences, including corrective action plans, formal audit findings, and heaven forbid, clawbacks,” wrote Penelope Doherty, who works with the agency’s regional office. “Any of these can affect a state’s ability to receive federal funding of any kind, not just from FEMA.”

Last year’s flooding was the result of two separate severe storms. On July 10, up to 7 inches of rain dropped on parts of Vermont in a matter of hours. On July 30, with the soil still soaked and rivers high, the Northeast Kingdom region got upward of 8.4 inches. The torrential rains killed two people, ripped apart homes, and caused billions of dollars’ worth of damage. Within weeks, FEMA approved an official disaster declaration and Vermont stood up a temporary “bridge” team of case managers that were largely reassigned from other state positions. That program was set to wind down at the end of the year and there were still dozens of active cases. So two days before Christmas, the state submitted a grant application to FEMA aimed at addressing the “unmet needs” of Vermonters.
In its application, the state estimated that 134 flood survivors still needed so-called “disaster case management,” or extra assistance developing and implementing a recovery plan. Some $2.5 million of the grant would “be specifically for” seven disaster case managers, or DCMs, three construction managers and a supervisor. There are no other positions mentioned in the state’s application or included in its budget.

In February, FEMA approved Vermont’s $2.9 million Disaster Case Management Program. The state in turn hired the consulting firm Guidehouse, which used to be the public sector arm of PwC (formerly PricewaterhouseCoopers). Through various mergers and acquisitions, it’s since grown into a $7 billion company now owned by the private equity giant Bain Capital.
Vermont had been working with Guidehouse since 2020, when the global COVID-19 pandemic took hold. The state competitively bid and signed a five-year master contract with Guidehouse that let any of its agencies issue a “task order” for services from the company, without having to seek bids again. While the bulk of the work seems to have stayed in the COVID realm, the governor told reporters in 2024 that the company was also helping to “augment” the state’s flood response effort. 
This April, Vermont’s secretary of human services, chief recovery officer, and an assistant attorney general signed a nearly $2.5 million task order with Guidehouse to help with the FEMA disaster management grant. It names Gosselin as a primary contact and includes language such as, “The contractor shall support the state in administering its DCM program” and “provide implementation and strategic advisory assistance to the state.” It doesn’t have the specific staffing requirements.
With its orders in hand, Guidehouse then did its own subcontracting for the frontline workers. It turned to the New England Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church, or NEAC, which had been involved with previous flood recovery efforts in Vermont. But that subcontract proved to be significantly narrower than what was in the FEMA agreement. NEAC would provide only four case managers, not seven, and just two construction coordinators, not three. Guidehouse would also pay the organization just $1,098,875 to get the job done, including a travel budget. That’s less than half what Guidehouse got from the state and what FEMA awarded for the work. It’s unclear exactly what the company’s plan was for the other $1.4 million, but the NEAC agreement lists six Guidehouse employees working on the project — a nearly 1:1 ratio with frontline workers.

All federal grants involve some level of administrative costs, explained MaryAnn Tierney, a former FEMA regional administrator and acting No. 2 at the agency. But when money that is meant to go to services goes to overhead, she said, “that’s not acceptable.”
Another former FEMA official, who asked not to be named publicly because they are now a consultant who works with the federal government, said the agency would start to get upset when such expenses reached 20 percent. “It doesn’t necessarily mean that I would have thought it was fraudulent,” they said. “I would just be grumpy because it’s a waste of money.”
Vermont’s case is a “classic” example of what happens when a state or municipality writes a vague contract, said Craig Fugate, who was the FEMA administrator from 2009 to 2017. He explained that any contract should provide clear and measurable deliverables, with penalties for not performing. 
Without a strong agreement, a consultant can largely dictate their own boundaries. “You see a lot of money getting spent on process. More meetings, more reviews,” said Fugate. While no one technically violates the contract, “it doesn’t seem that much work is getting done, and you end up with a lot of billable hours.”

By the time Gosselin did his August accounting, Guidehouse had already billed 4,877 hours of time — worth over half a million dollars. The Guidehouse report to the state that his math was based on shows 48 percent of that money going directly toward Guidehouse staff. The consulting firm also added overhead to the NEAC staff’s hourly rates, meaning that an even greater share went to the company.
According to two people involved in the grant, it was common for multiple Guidehouse employees to attend meetings, and it was often unclear why they were necessary. “It muddied the waters a little bit,” said one of them. Both mentioned that the role of Lina Hashem, a director at Guidehouse, was especially confusing and redundant, especially given her billing rate: $293 per hour.

Before becoming FEMA administrator, Fugate spent decades as an emergency manager at state and local levels. The role of contractors has expanded dramatically, he said. Where companies used to be selling mostly goods or products — say generators, or computer systems — many are now offering services, such as consulting. 
Outside companies can be a useful force multiplier in the wake of a disaster, and offer expertise that states may not have. “For state governments, you’re never going to have enough people to handle Hurricane Katrina,” he said. “But you always have to keep the idea that we’re not turning over running the response or the recovery to a vendor.”
FEMA spends tens of billions of dollars every year on disaster recovery, but there is also additional funding available across the federal government: more than two-dozen other agencies run nearly 100 different response or recovery programs. 
There have been several high profile instances of either contractor abuse or state mismanagement. Following a 2014 tornado in Louisville, Mississippi, the inspector general overseeing FEMA recommended that the agency claw back $25 million because the city didn’t follow proper procurement procedures. Last year, the consulting firm Horne paid a $1.2 million fine for improper billing in the wake of extreme rainfall in West Virginia in 2016. Horne now holds a controversial $81 million contract to help North Carolina recover from Hurricane Helene.
Guidehouse’s work has also come under scrutiny. Last year, it paid a $7.6 million fine for a data breach tied to the company’s work administering New York’s rental assistance program during the pandemic. Still, it’s become a major player in the disaster space nationwide. It won the $135 million contract to revamp the National Flood Insurance Program and a $38 million one to do identity verification for FEMA. It also acquired part of a company that worked with New Jersey in the wake of Superstorm Sandy and Florida after Hurricane Irma. 
Vermont’s vendor payment portal shows $41 million in payments to Guidehouse since 2020, and not all the state’s experiences with the company have been bad. It was instrumental in helping Vermont navigate both the COVID pandemic and 2023 flooding, said Ben Rose, who retired as Vermont Emergency Management’s recovery and mitigation section chief at the end of 2024. 
“It’s really hard to hire people through the state system,” he said. “You can be more nimble by hiring consultants when you need help.”
That said, Rose was cognizant that Guidehouse was a for-profit company and said keeping tabs on its scope of work and spending was important. “They would sometimes say, ‘Hey, we’ll make it easy for you, let us show you a draft task order,’” he recalled. Rose would then take off things that he didn’t need. “It was a healthy back and forth.”
In his August emails, Gosselin appears surprised by how much of the grant money was going to Guidehouse. And when FEMA started asking for more details, the state dragged its feet in explaining what happened. Initially, Dougherty wrote in her warning note, the state had “revealed a decision to reduce service delivery staff,” which would have been acceptable as long as the budget was reduced as well. But after more than two months, and three draft proposals, she noted that there still wasn’t a formal update to the original plan. 
“We have been requesting this articulation since mid-July,” wrote Dougherty, in late September. “[It] really must be finalized to avoid risking corrective actions.”

The state continues to work with FEMA on an updated plan, said Douglas Farnham, Vermont’s chief recovery officer. But he defended the state’s use of Guidehouse, which he said was a natural fit for the project because it already worked with the state and was best positioned to rapidly stand up this program, too.  
“They’re not the cheapest partner to work with, but they have great expertise,” said Farnham, adding that moving quickly adds expense as well. He blamed the high initial billing ratios — with nearly half going to Guidehouse — on startup costs for the project. 
“Ideally, you wouldn’t see it bump that high,” he said, but after the state reviewed the expenses, they found them to be reasonable. “At the end of the day, we believe the costs were appropriate. They were necessary to build the program, and we’ll work it out with FEMA.”
FEMA could not be reached for comment due to the current government shutdown.
Farnham said that the state has since set a new target of 17 percent for Guidehouse’s share of billable work, with the rest going toward program delivery. “It definitely stops the major bleed,” said one person familiar with the changes, though they still question why Guidehouse has to remain involved at all. And because the changes come months into the project and more than a year after the flooding, some say much of the harm has already been done.
Guidehouse, Inc. presentation, dated September 8, 2025, stating the State of Vermont had asked the company to reduce the amount it was billing.
For one, Vermont has already paid Guidehouse hundreds of thousands dollars that FEMA has yet to reimburse. If the agency doesn’t do that, Farnham said the money would come out of the state’s reserve fund for federal denials. Timing was also a problem. The FEMA-funded case management program wasn’t approved until seven months after the disaster declaration. Farnham, while grateful for the money, said that was a result of FEMA’s “very long and complicated” application process.
The state also hired fewer workers than planned because there weren’t as many cases as expected, Farnham said. The benefit of a contractor, he said, is that the number of workers can be adjusted up or down. But the company’s own October 1 report listed a “medium” risk that the caseload “may exceed budgeted project team capacity.”
Farnham doesn’t think that will happen, and would rather extend the length of the program to help handle cases that come up later. FEMA has not approved that extension, but in her September email, Dougherty did tell the state to “be aware of the inherent conflict in simultaneously saying you’re behind/need more time and saying outreach results indicate you can reduce the work force/work pace.”
Guidehouse’s agreement with Vermont only covered disasters that happened through June 2025, and the state has chosen another company for its next master contract. Farnham declined to explain why, and Guidehouse declined to comment for this story, as did NEAC. Gosselin didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or a list of written questions. But long-term recovery groups say that, even when the state did finally get involved in case management, it failed to coordinate well with those already on the ground. “They confused everybody,” said Meghan Wayland, president of the Kingdom United Resilience & Recovery Eﬀort. “They called all of the people in our neighborhood. It creates chaos and we have to go clean up their messes.”
Wayland and Linskey, from the Recovery After Floods Team, say that better collaboration with organizations like theirs could have meant more work for the FEMA-funded folks, too. For example, the NEAC team could have taken on particularly difficult cases or focused on areas of the state where the local capacity isn’t as robust. “They could have designed a program that would have benefited Vermonters and not compromised the efforts that are underway,” said Wayland. “That would have been a really lovely thing for them to do.”

Multiple people pointed to Gosselin as a major source of the state’s issues. “He doesn’t have the appropriate skill set for the thing he’s been put in charge of,” said Wayland. But Gosselin notably wasn’t the signatory on the Guidehouse task order or the FEMA application, which were ostensibly reviewed by officials higher up in government. That includes Farnham, who praised Gosselin for flagging Guidehouse’s invoices for review and said “everything that I worked with him on this, I believe he took the right course of action.”
For now, FEMA’s review of Vermont’s spending is still underway. But the lesson may already be clear: As floods multiply and dollars surge, America’s recovery system is only as strong as the contracts holding it together. And, currently, states could be a weak point in that chain. 
“By shoving responsibilities from the federal level onto the state’s shoulders, it is creating a market for private contractors,” said one FEMA employee, who asked to remain anonymous because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. “They’re sitting ducks.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-16 20:40:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Bronin leads Larson in fundraising in 1st District race,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/16/bronin-leads-larson-in-fundraising-in-1st-district-race/,"Luke Bronin raised nearly $1.2 million since announcing in late July, compared to John Larson’s $809,000 haul over the past three months.","Luke Bronin took an early fundraising lead among Democrats vying for Connecticut’s 1st Congressional District seat, currently held by U.S. Rep. John Larson, but some candidates are using new strategies in a race becoming increasingly skeptical of traditional ways of amassing donations.
Bronin’s money advantage in the most recent fundraising quarter was expected, as it was previewed before the filing deadline by the campaigns themselves. The former mayor raised nearly $1.2 million since announcing in late July, compared to Larson’s $809,000 haul over the past three months. But Larson has had more time to fundraise and has raised nearly $1.1 million this year.
The fundraising reports publicly released this week are the first real look inside what’s fueling each campaign, where the money is coming from and how much they’ll be working with in the fight for the nomination in the safely Democratic Hartford-based district.
Bronin and Larson are well ahead of most of the other candidates in fundraising, though Southington Councilman Jack Perry loaned his campaign $500,000. That gives him a boost over state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest of West Hartford and Hartford school board member Ruth Fortune. But when it comes to individual contributions, Perry raised the least of any candidate.
Each of the five declared candidates needed to file a report with the Federal Election Commission by Wednesday that detailed the money raised and spent between July and September. Some of Larson’s challengers jumped into the race part of the way into the third fundraising quarter of the year.
The fundraising battle has largely centered around the origin of donations, particularly from Bronin on outside groups. Larson’s other challengers bemoaned the heavy emphasis on fundraising altogether, despite the reality of needing enough funds to afford advertising in the Hartford media market and boost name recognition competing against Larson, a 14-term congressman, and Bronin, a former two-term mayor of Hartford.
Bronin has sworn off campaign contributions from corporate political action committees, commonly referred to as PACs, and has taken multiple swipes at Larson for heavily relying on such money in past campaign cycles.
Bronin’s $1.2 million haul comes completely from individual contributions and no PAC money. Much of his fundraising comes from within Connecticut, though he still raised a lot of money from elsewhere, including Washington, D.C., and New York. The report shows he largely dedicated the last couple of months to raising money and spent only about $90,000. That leaves him with the biggest cash reserves of all the candidates.
Bronin’s campaign anticipates Larson could raise more than him in the future but said outraising the congressman in the past quarter reflects the appetite for the generational change that’s been at the center of Bronin’s campaign.
“John Larson has been in office for almost three decades, he’s taken millions of dollars from corporate PACs, and we still expect he’s going to out-raise us,” Bronin campaign senior advisor Amanda Sands said in a statement. “But outraising him this quarter without a cent of corporate PAC money shows that there’s a lot of enthusiasm for Luke, and there are lots of people who know it’s time for change.”
In the most recent fundraising quarter, Larson raised a substantial portion of his money from PACs — nearly $310,000 — including those representing businesses and corporations. But he raised more money from individual contributions — $495,000 — with the overwhelming majority of it coming from contributors in Connecticut. His most recent haul from individual contributions was far more than the past two fundraising quarters this year, before he had any competition.
Some of the PACs that donated higher sums of money to Larson during the past quarter include American Institute of Certified Public Accountants PAC, Boeing Company PAC, Cigna Corporation PAC, Employees of RTX Corporation PAC, and Eversource Energy PAC.
Larson also spent more money than Bronin and the rest of his challengers. But Bronin’s cash on hand outpaced everyone in the field, going into October with $1.1 million compared to Larson’s $879,000 in the bank.
Larson said he’ll continue to focus on his opposition to President Donald Trump rather than his Democratic competitors.
“At a time when President Trump and his allies are attacking our democracy, targeting immigrant families and labeling me an agitator for standing up to them, this campaign is powered by people who know what’s at stake,” Larson said in a statement. “This support — over $1.2 million raised this cycle — sends a clear message: the people of the First District are ready to fight back. I will continue to stand up to Trump’s authoritarian overreach and protect our community, our democracy, and the values we share.”
While he’s slightly behind Bronin, Larson’s fundraising has improved compared to earlier quarters this year, as well as previous election cycles. He’s already raised more in the first nine months of the year compared to the last off-year, in 2023, which was about $724,000 for that entire year.
The congressman also raised more in 2025 than in all of 2024, an election year. But he didn’t have any primary challengers, and raising money wasn’t as crucial.
In his fundraising pitches before the deadline, Larson’s campaign drew a lot of attention from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which added his name to a list of Democrats and groups whom the agency characterized as having “hateful and violent” rhetoric, specifically in regard to immigration enforcement officials.
DHS singled out Larson’s comments at an August press conference in Connecticut. In it, the visibly frustrated congressman shouted about the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement and compared masked ICE agents, who are conducting raids and arrests across the U.S., to the “SS” and “Gestapo.”
Larson said earlier this month he didn’t see the remarks as hateful and said they were “intended to make a point.” He’s raised concerns about the raids carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the 1st Congressional District.
The congressman has also highlighted the support he’s getting from colleagues in Washington who have worked with him for years. 
He held a formal event last weekend to announce the endorsement of his colleague U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, who has been a national figure for being an outspoken Trump critic and a fundraising juggernaut.
Murphy’s own political action committee, American Mobilization PAC, contributed $5,000 to Larson’s campaign, according to his FEC report filed this week.
Larson has also benefited from support from past and present House Democratic leadership. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and one of his deputies, Pete Aguilar, both donated to Larson’s campaign in the past few months. Larson also got a donation from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The two worked together closely when Larson served in House Democratic leadership from 2009 to 2013.
For Bronin, he’s been trying to distinguish himself from the Democratic establishment in Washington, even as a two-term mayor of Hartford who worked in the Obama administration.
Calls for generational change and new candidates throughout the Democratic Party have grown since across-the-board losses during the 2024 elections.
Bronin’s team highlighted that sentiment with an interview between former President Joe Biden’s press secretary Jen Psaki and Democratic strategist Lis Smith, who questioned why Democrats aren’t “lifting up” the next generation. They specifically mentioned Bronin and the primary for Larson’s seat.
“This constant circling of the wagons, I think, is what is so frustrating to people. Why are you afraid of change? Why are you afraid of this? And so I think they’ll get a wake-up call in the Larson race,” Smith said in an interview Thursday on MSNBC.
Perry, Gilchrest, Fortune taking different approaches
Because the 1st Congressional District is a safe district, securing the Democratic nomination virtually means the candidate is on a glide path to victory. That’s why candidates need to raise enough funds over the next few months to afford things like television ads and securing their name on the ballot for the primary.
Perry loaned his campaign $500,000 in the past fundraising quarter. He is the former owner of a waste hauling and recycling business, HQ Dumpsters, that he sold to a larger competitor. He only raised nearly $29,000 from individual contributors, but he goes into the final months of the year with a decent cushion because of the loan.
Perry, who serves as a town councilman in Southington, said he doesn’t plan to keep self-funding but wanted to show that he has a serious campaign that is viable. He noted that federal campaign finance regulations are very different from Connecticut’s, where more money can come into play. And he said a lot of the support right now in the state should go to the local municipal races that are coming up.
“It takes time to build the infrastructure, and we’re trying to fundraise, but [at] the same time, I don’t want to also make it that we have to focus on just asking people for money,” Perry said in an interview. “I think the balancing act — yes we need to do fundraisers, reach out and raise money, but it’s also important that we can talk about the issues, listen to the issues that the working and middle class are facing, because I feel the Democratic Party has failed all of us right now.”
Gilchrest’s contributions are mostly from donors in Connecticut, with a mix of nonprofits, state legislators and government staffers, attorneys, those in health care, religious institutions and teachers and professors. She raised more than $54,000, spent almost $10,000 and has almost $45,000 cash on hand. Some of her biggest spending of the quarter was on texting and phone banking services through a political consulting firm in Avon.
Gilchrest said she’s been more focused on outreach and building relationships with voters who in turn would consider donating to the campaign — something she said takes time. She expects to turn more attention to fundraising over the coming weeks and months. More recently, she has spent time meeting with voters at coffee shops, playgrounds and Democratic Town Committee events.
She’s been critical of the reliance of congressional candidates on fundraising, particularly in this primary. But Gilchrest acknowledged she’ll need more money to compete and said she views it “as a marathon versus a sprint.” She said she was told a candidate will need at least $1 million to $1.5 million “to get my message out.”
“I just feel like if the race is decided because of fundraising numbers, we’ll get the exact same kind of ineffective Congress we’ve had for years,” Gilchrest said in an interview. “I think people are very frustrated by the constant onslaught of fundraising texts and emails that they receive and then no action on the part of the politicians they elect. And so we need to do politics differently, and I need to build those relationships with folks before they’re willing to invest in the campaign. And that makes sense to me.”
Gilchrest, who noted she doesn’t come from a wealthy background, said what she raised in a month is more money than many people earn in a year.
Fortune offered a similar sentiment about her own fundraising. She was the first person to enter the race for the Democratic nomination and raised about $41,000 and spent about $5,600.
“I raised more money this quarter than my mother ever earned annually and spent $5,644.60 as a first-time candidate who built a campaign from scratch. Yet, the two well-funded candidates in this race spent a combined $283,000 this quarter, and it’s not their first rodeo,” Fortune said, referencing the combined spending over the past few months by Bronin and Larson. “Every year, campaigns spend more money than it would take to end homelessness and hunger in America.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0118_SR_PeoplesMarch_990-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-16 17:03:30.608618

Members of the bipartisan Michigan Association of County Clerks on Wednesday said they unanimously voted to oppose the pending 2026 ballot measure, which would establish ranked choice voting for all elections. Clerks aligned with the association said the measure being pushed by Rank MI Vote was concerning. The group cited timeliness issues related to election certification and delays in the recount or audit process.
Among their members is Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum, who is currently seeking the office of Michigan secretary of state in the 2026 contest. Byrum also holds multiple leadership positions with the association, according to its website.
On Thursday, following the association’s announcement opposing ranked choice voting, the Michigan Conservative Coalition and Pure Integrity Michigan Elections released a joint statement thanking the association for its opposition to the Rank MI Vote measure.
“When the very people responsible for running our elections speak with one voice against a proposed system, Michigan voters should take notice,” said Patrice Johnson, chairperson of Pure Integrity Michigan Elections, in a statement. “These clerks aren’t politicians or activists. They’re the dedicated public servants who ensure every legal vote is counted accurately and transparently.”
It was a moment of rare unity, not just between the bipartisan association for county clerks in Michigan, but also for a group like Pure Integrity Michigan Elections and Byrum, who has in the past called the group, and others like it, a vassal of election deniers conspiracy theories related to the 2020 election.
Election denialism has strong roots in Michigan given the fact that Detroit and its absentee board counting center was at the heart of some of the conspiracies bandied about after former President Joe Biden won the state by a wide margin in 2020, helping in his overall victory against then- and now current President Donald Trump.
In a report published by Progress Michigan in 2022, the progressive advocacy group noted the intricacies of the Michigan Republican Party and its relationship with election conspiracy theorists.
The very first quote in the report comes directly from Byrum.
“These workers and volunteers can easily disrupt the process by challenging everything they see,” said Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum. “Or by intentionally slowing down their work, or leaving the polling place or the absentee counting board when they aren’t supposed to. … “Disenfranchising even one voter is too many.”
Deep within the Progress Michigan report is a section detailing the different groups that have worked to further those conspiracies, and Pure Integrity Michigan Elections is featured in a full page spread.
Progress Michigan wrote in 2022 that Pure Integrity Michigan Elections, which was formed after the 2020 election, at one point employed Linda Lee Tarver as its spokesperson. Tarver is a prominent Michigan GOP activist, party fixture and a former candidate for the state Board of Education.
Tarver was a key voice in the push to have the 2020 election decertified.
Neither the Michigan Association of County Clerks nor Byrum responded to questions from Michigan Advance about the support they received from Pure Integrity Michigan Elections, and what it means for them to both be in the same boat now.
When asked by the Advance about the endorsement of the clerks’opposition by Pure Integrity Michigan Elections, Joe Spaulding, campaign director for Rank MI Vote, did not directly address that point, but did say that ranked choice voting gives power back to voters, not parties. 
“It encourages candidates to build broader coalitions, focus on issues that unite communities, and win on ideas instead of partisan outrage,” Spaulding said. “Michigan voters are smart enough to rank their preferences. What county clerks are calling ‘confusing’ is really just more democratic.”

Berny Jacques in Tampa on Sept. 19, 2025. (Photo by Don Kruse for the Florida Phoenix)A Florida Republican on Thursday re-filed a bill from last year requiring all private employers to use a federal database verifying whether new hires are legally in the country.
Rep. Berny Jacques, a Seminole Republican, issued HB 197 to mandate all private businesses use E-Verify, a federally operated system allowing employers to electronically verify whether new employees can legally work in the United States. Florida already requires all public agencies, their contractors, and their subcontractors to use E-Verify.
“Beginning on July 1, 2026, a private employer shall use the E-Verify system to verify a new employee’s employment eligibility,” the bill reads, striking existing language that only requires businesses with at least 25 employees to use E-Verify.
More than 475,000 small businesses in Florida have fewer than 20 employees, according to a 2025 report by the Small Business Administration. Not counting businesses without employees — of which there are more than 2 million — there are fewer than 518,000 total small businesses employing one to 499 Floridians.
Jacques, who had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publishing, had tried to pass this measure during the 2025 session, but it never made it to its final committee stop. This came despite favorable votes from Republican-dominated committees at both of its earlier committee meetings.
E-Verify in Florida
Immigration has been a headlining topic for Florida Republicans in recent years, dominating the past few sessions.
In 2023, former senator — now Chief Financial Officer — Blaise Ingoglia, a Spring Hill Republican, sponsored a massive immigration crackdown. The sweeping law required private businesses with at least 25 employees to use E-Verify and mandated Medicaid-accepting hospitals to question whether patients are citizens and report that information quarterly to the state.
During the 2025 session, GOP lawmakers upped the ante with another immigration package, this time forcing all counties to partner with ICE, removing in-state tuition for undocumented college students, and creating a state-level crime of illegally entering Florida.
The anti-undocumented immigration fervor has been reflected on the national stage under President Donald Trump, who’s expanded Immigration and Customs Enforcement, encouraged construction of detention centers nationwide, and promised federal grants to states aiding in the arrest and detention of undocumented immigrants.
Last session, Sen. Jason Pizzo of Sunny Isles Beach, then a Democrat and now an independent, filed a competing bill that would have severely punished businesses for flouting E-Verify requirements. Although it similarly required all private companies to use the system, it would have revoked the business license of an employer who hires an immigrant illegally in Florida and charged him tens of thousands in fines.
Under existing law, the Florida Department of Commerce can fine violators $1,000 per day three times within two years, place them on probation for a year, and have them report to the department quarterly.
Pizzo has yet to file a similar bill for the 2026 session. He had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publishing.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current) The quasi-governmental agency that finances affordable home construction in Rhode Island has consolidated its pay grades down from over two dozen separate classifications down to 16.
RIHousing’s board of directors on Thursday unanimously approved changes to the agency’s executive compensation package within three minutes without any questions for the agency’s general counsel. The approval comes about a month after House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale criticized the agency for not answering his inquiries about its finances.
Chippendale, a Foster Republican, had called for a forensic audit after accusing RIHousing of being “bloated” and inefficient. House Republicans released a report that found the agency had the second highest combined administrative and personnel costs in the region at $46.4 million. 
Chippendale was not present for Thursday’s board meeting. Before the meeting, he issued a statement calling out the board for even considering a discussion on compensation packages
“Are they serious?” Chippendale said in a statement Thursday. “Under the Quasi-Public Corporations Accountability and Transparency Act, the board is expected to provide active oversight, ensure fiscal discipline, and hold the agency accountable to the public it serves.”
RIHousing’s board was supposed to consider the updates to executive compensation during its meeting on Sept. 18, but that meeting was canceled due to a lack of a quorum.
Christine Hunsinger, spokesperson for RIHousing, claims Chippendale is making a big deal out of something the commission does every three to five years.
“We’re required to do this by law,” she said in an interview.
Ohio-based CBIZ Compensation Consulting was contracted in 2024 by RIHousing to study the latest compensation rates, making its official recommendations in May — namely reducing the number of pay grades to be in line with its 16-grade scale.
Since 2021, RIHousing had used a 25-grade scale compiled by MGT Consulting of Tampa, Florida.
“It’s really just to streamline and ensure everyone gets a fair salary and predictability,” Hunsinger said. “Having broader ranges allows more people to fit into them.”
Executive Director Carol Ventura is in the top pay grade level, which now ranges from $182,095 to $282,247 a year. Under the two-year contract approved by the board in June, Ventura makes an annual salary of $232,171.
The top pay grade in the last compensation schedule adopted in 2022 ranged between $154,746 and 223,927.
Under the new compensation schedule, the lowest pay grade ranges from an annual salary of $48,828 to $56,152. Under the 2022 salary structure, the lowest-paid executive staff made between $44,012 to $59,935.
In addition to the updated salary ranges, RIHousing’s new executive compensation includes minor updates to job descriptions for the chief administrative officer and president of proactive development.
During Thursday’s meeting, Ventura acknowledged Chippendale’s request of a forensic audit requesting, characterizing his request as seeking “details on certain RIHousing-financed developments.”
“Staff are currently in the process of assembling the information requested by Leader Chippendale and providing background information on the extensive auditing that is conducted every year on RIHousing and its programs for House and Senate leadership,” Ventura wrote in a memo to the board.
Chippendale’s request for an audit will be formally considered by the General Assembly’s Joint Committee on Legislative Services, which will meet some time in November, House spokesperson Larry Berman said in an email Thursday.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) North Carolina is joining a coalition of nearly two dozen states suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for rescinding more than $156 million pledged for solar projects in the state.
Attorney General Jeff Jackson and representatives of 22 other states, as well as the District of Columbia, sued the EPA on Wednesday, saying the agency illegally canceled the Solar for All program.
Solar for All, a Biden-era initiative launched as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, allocated $7 billion in grants nationally to 60 recipients including states, tribes, and regions. The funds were earmarked for solar projects like rooftop solar and community solar gardens for more than 900,000 lower-income households.
The program’s discontinuation signified the Trump administration’s push away from cleaner energy, following additional cuts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”
Democrats in North Carolina’s congressional delegation sent a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in August, asking him to reconsider and ultimately reverse the program’s termination, NC Newsline previously reported.
Jackson said the funds would have helped low-income and rural North Carolinians save money on their energy bills.
“Thousands of families were going to have the option to install solar power, save money, and have another energy option after a major storm,” Jackson said in a statement. “Now EPA has illegally cancelled those funds — so I’m going to court to bring $150 million back to our state.”
North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Reid Wilson said the program’s cancellation eliminates the installation of rooftop solar panels for more than 12,000 low- and medium-income families.
Projects using Solar for All funds were planned to start in fall 2025, according to Jackson’s office.
“Rooftop solar drives down utility bills, reduces air pollution and creates jobs. The program’s cancellation would hurt the electric grid’s ability to be resilient to future disasters, and would hamper North Carolina’s efforts to ensure reliable, clean and affordable energy supplies to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population and rising energy demand,” Wilson said in a statement.
Representatives for the EPA did not immediately respond to NC Newsline’s request for comment.
Plaintiffs described the EPA’s cancellation of the program and subsequent unilateral termination of all grant agreements as “a clear, unambiguous, and material breach of the agreements between the EPA and Plaintiffs,” the lawsuit read.
The plaintiffs’ grant agreements allowed for termination “only in the narrow circumstances of substantial noncompliance that materially impairs performance, adequate evidence of waste, fraud or abuse, or material representation of eligibility status,” the lawsuit read. Plaintiffs said these matters did not occur.
A few days after the cancellation in August, the EPA withdrew about 90% of grant funds from plaintiffs’ Automated Standard Application for Payment (ASAP) accounts, according to the lawsuit.
“The administration is again targeting people struggling to get by in America, this time by gutting programs that help low-income households afford electricity,” Washington State Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement. “Congress passed a solar energy program to help make electricity costs more affordable, but the administration is ignoring the law and focused on the conspiracy theory that climate change is a hoax.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/solar-panels.jpg,,,2025-10-16 17:03:30.608618

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has summoned the Louisiana Legislature for a three-week special session starting next week to address next year’s election plans. 
The special session will begin Thursday, Oct. 23,  and end no later than Nov. 13.
Lawmakers will be allowed to file bills related to “election code, election dates, election deadlines, and election plans for the 2026 election cycle” and funding bills related to those items. 
The governor’s call is broadly written and could allow for a wide variety of election bills. 
Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said that the governor told him that Landry’s priorities are to move back qualifying deadlines for next fall’s election to give the state an opportunity to react to a U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling expected sometime next spring. Justices heard arguments Wednesday in Callais v. Louisiana, a decision that could require or allow the adoption of new congressional maps. 

Supreme Court seems open to limiting key voting protections in Louisiana redistricting case


Henry said no new maps would be drawn in this session. 
Questions from justices during Wednesday’s hearing indicated they are open to limiting the consideration of race in the redistricting process. Depending on the outcome of the case, Louisiana could redraw its congressional boundaries to reduce or eliminate the number of majority Black districts. Currently, two of Louisiana’s six congressional districts are majority Black. 
Louisiana will move to closed primaries starting with next year’s congressional elections, and the current election calendar for 2026 does not give lawmakers an opportunity to change district boundaries after a decision comes out. 
Party primaries for the fall congressional election are currently scheduled for April 18, and the Supreme Court decision could come as late as the end of June.

(Photo by Ann Froschauer/USFWS)The Chinese drone company DJI is appealing a court ruling that upholds a U.S. Department of Defense decision to list it as a “Chinese military company.” 
As the ruling stands, DJI, which is one of the leading camera, civilian and agricultural drone companies, continues to bear the Chinese military company label which, the court wrote, “stigmatizes” the company and excludes it from certain contracts, grants and programs. 
According to the opinion from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the Department of Defense first listed DJI as a “Chinese military company” in 2022, then relisted it with the same designation in 2024. DJI pushed back on the designation and the department’s lack of notice or opportunity for DJI to be heard in the matter. 
As drones are becoming useful tools in all sorts of industries, including agriculture, some operators worry the drone industry would suffer — at least temporarily — without the prevailing Chinese technology on the market.

DJI filed a suit in October 2024 with the district court, the DoD responded that it was reevaluating the designation and in January 2025, it again reestablished that DJI was a Chinese military company. 
The department explained its designation by saying DJI was state-owned entity, had “received an unknown amount of funds” from several People’s Republic of China owned entities and “knowingly” received assistance from either the Chinese government or the Chinese Communist Party in the form of “science and technology efforts initiated under the Chinese military industrial planning apparatus.” 
The already-filed case was expedited because of the January designation, and DJI argued to the court that the department committed procedural errors in its designation and failed to evaluate contradictory evidence. 
The opinion, written by U.S. District Court Judge Paul Friedman for the District of Columbia, sided with the Department of Defense and upheld its designation, but also noted that the department “failed to proffer substantial evidence to support its finding that DJI meets the definition of ‘Chinese military company.’”
DJI officials, in a news release announcing the company had filed an appeal, said the arguments the court upheld were “limited findings that reaffirm DJI’s lack of military affiliation.” 
“We respect the Court’s process but are disappointed that the designation remains in place despite findings that reject the core of the DoD’s allegations,” a spokesperson for DJI said in the release. “We will continue to defend the integrity of our company as the findings reaffirm what we have maintained all along — that DJI operates independently, has no government or military affiliation, and is committed to the responsible development of drone technology.”
DJI maintains that it has never manufactured military drones or marketed equipment for combat.

The scorecard combined a number of factors into these rankings — and Michigan’s performance varied across them. Michigan ranked at 13th in access to care, but fell into the third quartile in the other categories — 37th in quality of care, 30th in costs and affordability and 32nd in population health. 
Vermont, Utah, and Minnesota received the highest scores overall, while Louisiana, Mississippi, and Kentucky ranked lowest.

The report shows that Michigan stands out regionally in certain metrics — in the Great Lakes region, Michigan had the lowest number of potentially avoidable emergency department visits age 65 and older, as well as the lowest share of older adults reporting loneliness or lack of emotional support.
Also in the Great Lakes region, Michigan was particularly affordable for drug costs in the Part D program for Medicare recipients, with the lowest average out-of-pocket spending and lowest total share of drug costs paid by individual beneficiaries. 
However, Michigan struggled in other areas. In multiple categories of “quality of care,” including hospital admissions for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions and 30-day hospital readmissions, Michigan ranked 48th and 46th, respectively
22.4% of Michiganders are enrolled in some kind of Medicare plan, among the highest in the nation — and over half of those are on a Medicare Advantage plan, a private alternative to Original Medicare that can come with more limitations on doctor and hospital choice but can also come with additional care benefits. Behind Maine, that is the highest percentage of the population on a Medicare Advantage plan, nearly 14%. 
“Medicare is a lifeline for millions of Americans, and for the first time this scorecard shows how people’s experiences with the program vary widely depending on where they live,” wrote Gretchen Jacobson, the Commonwealth Fund’s Vice President for Medicare, in a press release accompanying the scorecard. “In some states, beneficiaries can see doctors quickly and afford their prescriptions; in others, they face higher costs, delays, or red tape. By learning from states where Medicare works best, policymakers and health leaders can strengthen the program for everyone.”

,DC,2025-10-16 19:44:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"With funding for courts in question, Congress stuck in shutdown gridlock for day 16","Jennifer Shutt, Ariana Figueroa",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/funding-courts-question-congress-stuck-shutdown-gridlock-day-16,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate left for its customary long weekend Thursday afternoon, following a brief three days in session despite the ongoing government shutdown. The House remained on an extended break from Capitol Hill, where neither Democrats nor Republicans seemed motivated to talk to each other despite mounting repercussions from the funding lapse.Federal courts, for example, reported just as the shutdown began Oct. 1, they could use “fee balances and other funds not dependent on a new appropriation” to keep up and running through Friday, Oct. 17. “If the shutdown continues after Judiciary funds are exhausted, the courts will then operate under the terms of the Anti-Deficiency Act, which allows work to continue during a lapse in appropriations if it is necessary to support the exercise of Article III judicial powers,” the announcement stated. “Under this scenario, each court and federal defender’s office would determine the staffing resources necessary to support such work.”A spokesperson for the courts wrote in an email to States Newsroom there were no updates to offer on funding or operations as of Thursday but signaled there could potentially be an announcement Friday. Trump spending cuts, layoffs The shutdown has had widespread ramifications across all three branches of government, including the Trump administration’s decision to cut spending approved by Congress and lay off thousands of federal employees, though that was temporarily halted by a federal judge this week. Federal workers who are categorized as essential will not receive their paychecks until after the shutdown ends. Furloughed employees may never receive the back pay authorized in a 2019 law if the Trump administration reinterprets it, as officials have said they might. None of the consequences produced any real sense of urgency this week on Capitol Hill, where West Virginia Republican Sen. Jim Justice organized a birthday party for his dog, or at the White House, where President Donald Trump held a ball for donors to his ballroom and focused on foreign policy. Just as they have for the last several weeks, members of Congress and administration officials continued holding separate press conferences and TV news appearances, lambasting their political opponents, none of which will help move the two sides closer together to reopen government. Failed vote No. 10Senators failed for the 10th time to advance the stopgap government spending bill on a 51-45 vote, short of the 60 needed to move forward under the chamber’s legislative filibuster. Republicans control the chamber with 53 seats.The Senate was also unable to move past a procedural hurdle on the full-year Defense Department funding bill after a 50-44 vote. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the bill this summer on a broadly bipartisan 26-3 vote. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters ahead of the vote that Democrats want some of the other annual appropriations bills added on to create a larger bill, though he didn’t say which of the dozen he prefers. ""It’s always been unacceptable to Democrats to do the Defense bill without other bills that have so many things that are important to the American people in terms of health care, in terms of housing, in terms of safety,” Schumer said. He added later that leaders from both political parties “have always negotiated these appropriations agreements in a bipartisan way. Once again, they’re just going at it alone.” Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, appeared to offer a package of bills negotiated between the parties before the vote on the defense bill. “We want this to be an open process with an opportunity to add additional bipartisan bills that address vital domestic priorities, including biomedical and scientific research and infrastructure,” Collins said. “And we want members to have a voice in the funding decisions that affect all of our states and constituents back home.”Stopgap bills in 2025Senate Majority Leader John Thune said during a floor speech earlier in the day the short-term government funding bill is needed to give lawmakers more time to negotiate final versions of the full-year spending bills. “We're simply asking them to extend current funding bills for a few weeks while we work on full-year appropriations,” Thune said. Congress is supposed to work out a bipartisan agreement between the House and Senate on those bills by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1, but hasn’t finished on time since the 1990s. So every September, once back from their August recess, the House and Senate write a stopgap spending bill that typically keeps the lights on until mid-December. Those short-term measures, sometimes called continuing resolutions or CRs, were traditionally negotiated among Republican and Democratic leaders in both chambers until earlier this year. House Republicans, bolstered by a sweep in last year’s elections, decided in March to write a six-month stopgap spending bill on their own, after two bipartisan short-term bills were approved earlier in the fiscal year. Senate Democrats voiced frustration with the process but ultimately helped Republicans get past a procedural vote that required the support of at least 60 lawmakers, allowing the March stopgap to advance toward a simple majority passage vote. House Republicans repeated their previously successful maneuver last month, writing a stopgap spending bill on their own that would fund the government through Nov. 21. Senate Democrats, however, changed tactics and have voted repeatedly to block the House-passed stopgap bill from advancing. Health care standoffDemocrats maintain that Republican leaders must negotiate to extend the enhanced tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. Republican leaders have said publicly over and over that they will, but cannot guarantee Democrats a final agreement will be able to pass both chambers. They also say talks will only begin after the stopgap bill becomes law and the government reopens. “Despite the fact we’re only in this position because of Democrats’ poor policy choices, Republicans are ready for that discussion,” Thune said. “But only once we’ve reopened the government.”Thune also raised concerns over what message it would send for GOP leaders to negotiate during the shutdown, which he said would endorse the use of funding lapses to achieve policy or political goals. Shutdowns in historyRepublicans forced the last two government shutdowns; the first in 2013 over efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the second in 2019 over Trump’s insistence lawmakers approve more funding for the border wall. Both were unsuccessful. Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a floor speech Thursday that Republicans drafting the stopgap spending bill on their own is a stark contrast to how things have worked for years and that they can’t expect Democrats to vote for something in which they had no say.  “For the last month, the Republican leader’s favorite number has been 13. He keeps citing 13 CRs that we passed when I was majority leader. Of course we did,” Schumer said.  “What he fails to mention — I'm not sure if he forgets, or he’s deliberately trying to ignore it — is that those 13 CRs were the product of bipartisan negotiation, of serious conversation. We had to make changes in those bills when our Republican colleagues suggested it,” he added. “They were in the minority, but they had the right to be heard, a right that has been completely shut out for Democrats under this new Republican majority.”Schumer warned Republicans about open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act Marketplace beginning on Nov. 1, saying tens of millions of Americans will soon realize what congressional inaction means for their family budgets. He said Republicans’ unwillingness to negotiate before the shutdown began or since shows they “either don’t understand it or they’re brutally callous.” ‘I want to be happy Mike’House Speaker Mike Johnson said during a Thursday morning press conference that Republicans “have no idea” how the government shutdown will end, and blamed Democrats in the Senate for not voting to advance the stopgap bill. House Homeland Security Committee Chair Andrew R. Garbarino of New York said the government shutdown is undermining the day-to-day operations of the Department of Homeland Security.“This shutdown is making our country less safe,” he said. Garbarino said roughly 90% of federal employees at the Department of Homeland Security are required to continue working because they have essential roles such as vetting customs at ports of entry and monitoring air space at airports. He said those working without pay include 63,000 U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees; more than 61,000 Transportation Security Administration agents; and 8,000 Secret Service agents. Garbarino added that he was grateful Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was using funds from the “One Big Beautiful Bill” to pay the roughly 49,000 Coast Guard personnel. In a statement to States Newsroom, DHS said it would be able to continue hiring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and “deploy law enforcement across the country to make America safe again” due to funding from the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” Amid the government shutdown, the Trump administration has continued its aggressive immigration crackdown.Johnson expressed his frustration that some Homeland Security employees were working without pay.“We should not have Border Patrol agents not (being) paid right now because Chuck Schumer wants to play political games to cover his tail,” the Louisiana Republican said. “I don’t like being mad Mike, I want to be happy Mike … but I am so upset about this.”",,,,2025-10-16 16:03:59.379003

In total, former U.S. Interior Secretary Haaland has reported more than 180,000 individual donations since her campaign began, helping her amass nearly $7 million. Of that, $4 million came in the last few months, according to her Oct. 14 report to the New Mexico Secretary of State’s Office. 
The sheer number of donation records “was so large it overwhelmed the SOS website,” a spokesperson said Wednesday. A Source analysis of the report illustrates Haaland’s widespread support.
Slightly more donations came from California than from New Mexico: 33,277 donations, totaling about $1.1 million. Haaland received 33,269 donations from New Mexico, totaling about $1.9 million.
Governor’s race pulls in big bucks for Democratic frontrunners

North Dakotans gave $5,700 in 180 donations. Hawaiians gave $34,993. The Virgin Islands gave $45. 
The number of donations to Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and the nation’s first-ever Indigenous cabinet secretary under President Joe Biden, demonstrates her nationwide profile and towers over her closest opponent in the Democratic primary, Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman. He’s earned about $2.6 million from a little more than 2,200 donations. 
Many of Haaland’s donors gave multiple times and often just a few dollars at a time. More than 37,000 donations were for just $5. Her average donation is $37. 
The most recent filings cover donations between April and September, with about seven months until the June 2, 2026 primary election.
In a statement about the donations, Haaland thanked her supporters, noting the number of donations from New Mexicans since announcing her campaign in January.

“I look forward to continuing to travel the state, hearing directly from New Mexicans about their struggles, and what they want to see in plans for affordability, healthcare, education, and public safety,” she said.
The biggest donation of $215,000 came from Haaland’s congressional campaign account. After that, a few other top donors who gave around $12,000 each include Illinois Gov. Jay Pritzker; Gerald Singleton and Brett Schreiber, the namesakes of a prominent law firm with business in New Mexico. Several Indigenous tribes across the country also donated, and Haaland received donations from campaign committees for U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) and Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Maryland).
Of Bregman’s reported donations, about 20% were from out-of-state contributors, according to his filings. 
“This campaign is powered by New Mexicans who want a candidate with a real common-sense plan for the future.” Bregman said in a statement. “As the outsider in this race, nobody expected us to raise this kind of money. But I’ve never been one to shy away from hard work. This incredible show of support proves folks are ready for something new.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Iowa’s largest health insurer, Wellmark Blue Cross-Blue Shield, is suing the Iowa insurance commissioner to block enforcement of a new state law that attempts to regulate pharmacy benefit managers.
Earlier this year, state lawmakers and the governor approved Senate File 383, which regulates pharmacy benefit managers, employee benefit plans, insurance carriers, and other third-party payors that provide or administer prescription drug benefits.
The Iowa Association of Business and Industry filed a lawsuit in June to block enforcement of the new law. On July 21, 2025, a federal judge ruled the law was, in some respects, illegal and invalid and issued an injunction blocking its enforcement

However, that court ruling was limited in that it prevents the state from enforcing the law only against the plaintiff in the case, ABI, and its members and contractors.

In its newly filed lawsuit over Senate File 383, Wellmark notes that nowhere in the ABI ruling did the court suggest that non-parties to that case were precluded from similarly challenging any future enforcement efforts, although the injunction in the ABI case is currently on appeal to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.
In its lawsuit against Iowa Insurance Commissioner Doug Ommen, Wellmark says the scope of the injunction raises the question of whether Ommen can “legitimately seek to enforce” the new law.
“The answer to that question, in Wellmark’s view, should be ‘no,’” Wellmark argues, stating that the court found the law is preempted by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, and that it also violates the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Despite that, Wellmark argues, on Sept. 24, 2025, Ommen issued guidance in the form of a bulletin indicating he believes he is “obligated” to enforce the new law “in its entirety” against all regulated entities who were not plaintiffs in the ABI case.
In addition, Wellmark says, the commissioner recently asked Wellmark for information regarding the new law’s implementation, signaling possible investigatory and enforcement efforts.
“Wellmark believes that the appropriate scope of the preliminary injunction should include Wellmark’s administration of all of its business accounts and individual insurance products — but Wellmark acknowledges the full scope of the preliminary injunction in this respect is subject to reasonable competing interpretations,” the lawsuit states. “That lack of clarity now necessitates Wellmark seeking relief in this court.”
The insurer says its legal action will help prevent “many piecemeal complaints” being filed to extend the ruling in the ABI case to others who weren’t part of that lawsuit.
“Wellmark had hoped to avoid filing this lawsuit,” the company states in its petition, adding that the commissioner’s position on enforcement, as well as Wellmark’s own interests and those of the people it insures, necessitates court intervention.
“The court should issue an injunction halting, and declare illegal, (the commissioner’s) enforcement of Senate File 383 with respect to the plans and policies Wellmark insures and administers for those who are not parties to ABI,” the petition states.
In addition to Wellmark Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Iowa, the plaintiffs in the case include affiliates Wellmark Inc., Wellmark Health Plan of Iowa, and Wellmark of South Dakota. The Iowa Insurance Division and Ommen have yet to file a response to the lawsuit, and the Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable Thursday to reach the division’s spokesperson for comment.
Wellmark is Iowa’s largest provider of health insurance and related administrative services, and also is Iowa’s largest provider of health insurance for individuals, such as those served by the health insurance exchange through the Affordable Care Act. According to the company, through its plans and policies, Wellmark now serves more than 800,000 people in Iowa.

The floor manager of the bill in the Iowa House was Rep. Brett Barker, a Story County Republican who is vice president of pharmacy for NuCara Management Group, an Iowa company that oversees 35 pharmacies. Barker has also served on the board of the Iowa Pharmacy Association, which lobbied the Iowa Legislature to approve the bill earlier this year. In 2022 and 2023, before his November 2024 election to the Iowa House, Barker worked as a lobbyist for the pharmacy association.
Among other requirements, the bill includes a provision for pharmacists to be paid a dispensing fee of $10.68 for preparing and dispensing medications. Opponents of the bill have argued it will increase Iowa consumers’ pharmaceutical costs by tens of millions of dollars annually.
As part is its lawsuit, Wellmark claims the legislation is one of “the most expensive, single Iowa legislative enactments ever passed effecting an increase in costs for health-benefit plans,” and says it will lead to the “largest increase in health benefit plan costs for Iowa’s third-party payors from any source of legislation — federal or state — since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act by Congress in 2010.”
The company estimates that for the plans and policies it insures or administers, the new law will increase costs by nearly $100 million annually, and that the individuals covered by Wellmark policies will face an additional $40 million in costs.
When signing the bill into law, Reynolds indicated it was a “difficult decision” for her.
“After extensive research and thoughtful conversations with employers and stakeholders on all sides of this complex issue, I made the decision to sign Senate Filed 383 in an effort to continue improving our health care system by bringing greater accountability to the role of pharmacy benefit managers,” she said in a written statement. “My administration will closely monitor implementation to mitigate and ensure that any unintended consequences for private employers are addressed.”

When the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s urban search and rescue team resigned after the deadly July 4, 2025, Texas floods, he told colleagues he was frustrated with bureaucratic hurdles that had delayed the team’s response to the disaster, according to media reports. The move highlighted an ongoing challenge at FEMA.
Ever since the agency lost its independent status and became part of the Department of Homeland Security in the early 2000s, it has faced complaints about delays caused by layers of bureaucracy and red tape, leaders at the top with little experience in emergency response, and whiplash policy changes.
Now, the Trump administration is cutting jobs at FEMA and talking about dismantling the agency, which would push more responsibility for disaster response to the states.
Yet, federal emergency management is crucial in America.
I run the Hazards Vulnerability & Resilience Institute at the University of South Carolina and for years have worked with states and communities facing hazards and disasters.
To better understand FEMA’s value, let’s take a look back at how the nation responded to disasters before the agency existed, and what history reveals about when FEMA was most effective.
Disaster response without the U.S. government
Before 1950, disaster relief and response were not considered a federal responsibility. When a hurricane, flood or tornado hit, community members and humanitarian groups, such as the American Red Cross or Salvation Army, brought in food, shelter and medical aid and solicited charitable donations to help people rebuild.
State and local governments had primary responsibility for disaster response. But mostly people relied on family, neighbors and charity.

Federal aid was approved on a case-by-case basis. War Department guidelines in 1917 stated that aid would be allowed only if a senior military officer certified that responding to the disaster would exceed local and state resources.
Then the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and the 1930s Dust Bowl gave new meaning to the concept of disaster in America.
In 1927, the Mississippi River broke through its levees, submerging more than 1 million acres of land across seven states. An estimated 700,000 people were displaced from their homes and workplaces.
Herbert Hoover, then U.S. commerce secretary, was given full authority to create, coordinate and carry out the federal relief effort.
The Red Cross set up camps using tents provided by the War Department. Coast Guard and Navy boats rescued people stranded by flooding.

But the response drew criticism for the lack of direct federal money to help flood survivors and the treatment of Black sharecroppers and laborers.
A few years later, the droughts of the Dust Bowl era began destroying crops in the Great Plains, causing widespread damage.
Federal disaster aid begins to take shape
After the flood, the federal government began to formalize its role in disaster management.
Flood control projects became a federal responsibility with the passage of the Flood Control Act of 1928.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal provided emergency relief to farmers in the Great Plains and set up the Soil Conservation Service to help them reduce the effects of future droughts.
These were among the first disaster mitigation policies at the federal level.
There was little coordination among agencies, however. Various aspects of disaster relief and recovery were handled by the departments of Defense, Agriculture, and Housing and Urban Development and the Small Business Administration. Each had its own rules and requirements.
In 1950, Congress passed the Federal Disaster Relief Act, establishing the first permanent authority for federal disaster relief.
The act gave the president the responsibility to determine how aid would be distributed and which agencies would be involved. The legislation also broadened the federal mission to include disaster preparedness and mitigation and formalized the process for issuing presidential disaster declarations.
The creation of FEMA
By the 1970s, large-scale disasters such as hurricanes Betsy (1965) and Camille (1969), and the fragmented disaster response, led the National Governors Association to call for a single comprehensive emergency management agency.
Its report provided the blueprint for President Jimmy Carter’s 1979 executive order that established the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA.
The new agency became the home for emergency management within the executive branch. It was intentionally designed as an independent federal administrative agency that could work across federal agencies to support state and local governments in times of crisis.
FEMA wasn’t created to lead the disaster response.
Instead, it helps state and local officials by mobilizing federal resources, such as search and rescue, debris removal and funding when a disaster overwhelms the state’s capacity.
FEMA could do this quickly because of established federal contracts and its ability to move equipment and responders into the region before a disaster hits.

When things began to fall apart
However, FEMA’s ability to act fast changed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The agency was restructured as a unit in the newly formed Department of Homeland Security.
But the Department of Homeland Security’s focus was on terrorism and law enforcement, not natural disasters.
The loss of autonomy and direct reporting to Congress, unfunded mandates outside the scope of the 1988 Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, and major increases in the number of large and complex disasters stretched FEMA’s capabilities.
When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, FEMA’s response drew widespread criticism.
It was slow to deploy people and supplies and lacked enough experienced responders who knew what to do. Decision-makers were not familiar with new national response plans. Further breakdowns in communications and a lack of coordination among agencies led Congress to declare the Hurricane Katrina response a failure of initiative and agility.
FEMA’s reputation improved after the government brought in more experienced leadership and committed to preparedness planning and better response capabilities.
However, the first Trump administration, from 2017 to 2021, reversed those gains. Three different heads of FEMA in four years led to understaffing and conflicting directions.
As Trump took office for the second time in 2025, he and his administration talked about dismantling FEMA and pushing more disaster management to states.
A series of disasters taught SC how to work with FEMA. Leaders encourage reform, not ending it.

Job cuts and resignations at FEMA reduced the number of employees with training and experience vital in disasters. Political appointees to senior roles in the agency and in the Department of Homeland Security lacked emergency management training and experience.
A new policy that all purchases over $100,000 be personally approved by Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem led to more resignations. For disaster response, a delay in waiting for a signature to work its way up the chain can cost lives.
What now?
Dismantling FEMA and leaving little or no federal coordination of disaster response puts states in a difficult position.
States must balance their budgets every year, and increasingly “rainy day” funds are insufficient to cover unexpected large disasters. As the federal government shifts other financial responsibilities to states, funds will diminish further.
A single disaster can cause hundreds of millions of dollars in damage and require widespread disaster response and then relief efforts. Since 1980, the cumulative cost of weather-related disasters has exceeded $2.9 trillion. With a warming atmosphere producing more intense storms, increasing human and economic harm are likely.
Members of Congress have proposed making FEMA an independent, Cabinet-level agency again. I see some distinct advantages in doing so:

Fewer management layers would enable faster deployment of federal supplies and personnel to assist disaster response.
A streamlined, more nimble agency could cut red tape for disaster survivors needing assistance, meaning delivering relief funding faster and more equitably.
If an independent FEMA had responsibility for recovery beyond its current 180-day reimbursement limits, that could improve long-term recovery efforts, especially if Congress provided permanent funding streams and consistent rules and regulations.

The Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle FEMA are shortsighted in my view. Instead, I believe the best move is to restore FEMA as an independent executive agency as it was originally envisioned.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Lynn Blais has spent much of the year stressed and anxious about her Aunt Peggy’s declining health. 
But it was rage that Blais felt when she read an Oct. 2 letter from Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island, announcing that its subsidized insurance coverage for her 85-year-old aunt was ending Jan. 1. A copy of the letter was shared with Rhode Island Current. 
“It just sent me right over the edge,” said Blais, a nurse at Our Lady of Fatima Hospital and president of the United Nurses & Allied Professionals. “She’s relying on health care the most she ever has in her entire life. To get blindsided with this notice, it’s just so inappropriate.”
Peggy — Blais asked not to print her aunt’s full name out of respect for her privacy — is among 275 Rhode Island seniors who will lose access to a discounted Medicare Advantage plan available to former company workers and their families at the end of the year, Rich Salit, a Blue Cross spokesperson, confirmed in an email on Thursday. The end of coverage was first reported by WPRI-TV 12 on Wednesday.










She’s relying on health care the most she ever has in her entire life. To get blindsided with this notice, it’s just so inappropriate. 


– Lynn Blais, whose aunt’s health insurance is covered by a Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island retirees plan


Salit cited “skyrocketing medical and prescription drug costs” and multimillion dollar operating losses as the impetus for the coverage ending, along with other cost-cutting measures. Health insurers nationwide, including Blue Cross, have faced major blows to their balance sheets and operating margins. The pressure is expected to intensify as health care costs swell and federal tax subsidies through the Affordable Care Act expire at the end of the year.
Other cost-cutting measures Blue Cross has planned include reducing spending on vendors and “working to proactively support members with complex needs to avoid more costly interventions,” Salit said. 
Blue Cross ended 2024 $115 million in the red, alongside a $113 million underwriting loss, prompting layoffs for 30 employees, or 3% of its staff, according to news reports. Its financial standing improved slightly as of June 2025, down to a $3.7 million loss, according to filings with the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation. 
Ending the subsidized Medicare Advantage group plan for former company retirees and their spouses will save the company $125,000 a year, while eliminating a $6 million liability from its balance sheet, Salit said.
The discounted plan was only available to former Blue Cross employees hired before 1992 who met age and years-of-service criteria, and their spouses, and who retired before April 1, 2013.

Blais’ aunt and her aunt’s late husband, Elia, have relied on the discounted insurance plan for over a decade, Blais said. Elia worked as chief legal counsel for the health insurer for a decade, leaving in the early 1990s to take a job with the state of Rhode Island. Elia died in April. But Peggy still uses the coverage to pay for physician visits to the nursing home and for medication to manage her Parkinson’s symptoms, Blais said.
Her aunt’s short-term memory and general health worsened considerably over the last year after she fell and broke her hip in January. She moved into a nursing home a few months later. Blais, who now serves as power of attorney for her aunt, had no intention of telling her aunt about the loss of coverage through Blue Cross.
“I wouldn’t want to stress her out,” Blais said. “It’s just not worth putting her through that.”
Blais is shouldering the stress alone as she considers alternatives.
Affected plan participants can choose another Medicare Advantage plan through Blue Cross, or other insurers, during the annual enrollment period that began Tuesday, and runs through Dec. 7. Salit said Blue Cross’ alternative plans for Medicare-eligible patients offer monthly premiums “as low as $0 to $35.”
But Blais was bracing for pricier premiums, given the nationwide trend in health insurance costs and her aunt’s age and existing health conditions.
“It’s not like I am insuring some 65-year-old, newly retired person,” Blais said.
Blue Cross offered a specialist and phone number in its letter to assist retirees and their spouses with preparing for  the end of subsidized insurance coverage. But Blais said she has not called the number.
 “That would not have been a fun conversation,” Blais said. “I am still too angry.”
Her indignation was not only for her aunt, but for other seniors set to lose insurance coverage who might not have someone to rely on for making health care decisions.
“Think of all those people who don’t have anybody who can stick up for them or help them in this,” Blais added. 
Blais also said she filed a complaint with the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha denounced health insurers for hiking costs to consumers, urging the Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurer to reject any requested rate increases for commercial insurance plans. Neronha’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on Thursday.
The approved 2026 commercial premiums, which do not cover Medicare Advantage plans, mark the largest increases in over a decade, though they are less than what insurers, including Blue Cross, requested. Medicare Advantage plans are regulated primarily through the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Rhode Island’s health insurance commissioner also licenses the companies that sell Medicare Advantage plans and considers their overall financial health in reviews of other commercial insurance premiums.

David Rosenberg College of Law in Lexington. (Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)LEXINGTON — Kentucky Supreme Court justices must once again balance power between the state’s executive and legislative branches. 
The high court heard oral arguments in two cases Wednesday involving separation of powers between Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and Republican office holders — a recurring theme during the governor’s two terms in office. 
One case centered on a 2021 law that shifts control of the State Fair Board from the governor to the agriculture commissioner. The second restructures the Executive Branch Ethics Commission, allowing each of the constitutional officers (with the exception of the lieutenant governor) to appoint a member. The governor, who now appoints all five members, would have only two appointments under the contested law and the rest would go to Republican office holders — Attorney General Russell Coleman, Secretary of State Michael Adams, Auditor Allison Ball, Treasurer Mark Metcalf and Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell 
Beshear and lieutenant governor are the only two Democrats in the executive branch. He has repeatedly tried to fend off legislation that bolsters the authority of the General Assembly, which is controlled by Republican supermajorities in both chambers. 
Though the cases deal with two different laws, lawyers before the court offered similar arguments in both of them. Matt Kuhn, the solicitor general in the attorney general’s office, argued that it is in the General Assembly’s purview to redistribute power within the executive branch. While discussing the Ethics Commission lawsuit, Kuhn pointed to Beshear’s disbanding of the previous commission in 2020 by way of executive order. 
“No other governor has abolished the commission. No other governor has ensured immediately that that governor has a majority of appointees. That’s what the General Assembly was responding to,” Kuhn said, adding that legislators wanted to “spread the appointment power.” 
The commission oversees ethical standards for all executive branch officials and employees. 
Meanwhile, Beshear’s General Counsel Travis Mayo argued that governors typically enjoy “supreme” power as the head of the executive branch, elected by voters every four years. One of those powers is the ability to appoint members of commissions and boards and is in the state Constitution, he added. 
The contested law involving the Ethics Commission removes “supreme executive power of appointment” from the commission that would “ensure that the commission faithfully executes the laws.”
“That violates the Constitution because it deprives the governor of the supreme executive power, and his ability to use that power of appointment, to ensure the laws are faithfully executed,” Mayo said. 
The justices had questions for both sides. Justice Angela McCormick Bisig raised concerns during the Ethics Commission hearing about the court having to weigh the checks and balances between the legislative and executive branches under the state Constitution.

“So my concern, as may be articulated in the previous oral argument, is having that ‘check’ go too far in either direction, because we are tasked with enforcing all of those sections of the Constitution holistically, and they must work in harmony together,” she said. 
Speaking to reporters after the hearings, Coleman, the Republican attorney general, said that he felt his office gave “two very successful arguments.” The attorney general also added that the crux of both cases is “the fact that the governor doesn’t like laws passed by the General Assembly — full stop.”
Asked if legislators would still feel motivated to enact such laws if the governor were a Republican, Coleman said the laws “just makes sense — Republican or Democrat.” 
“The General Assembly under our Constitution makes policy,” Coleman said. “They make these determinations of how to shift power. We enforce them on the first floor (of the Capitol).” 
Scottie Ellis, a spokesperson for Beshear said Thursday afternoon that the state Constitution says the “governor has the duty to ensure our laws are followed.”
“To do so, Gov. Andy Beshear should have the same authority as every governor before him,” she added. “The attorney general’s argument is that the General Assembly can take any executive power and move it away from any governor from a different party. It would render whole sections of the Constitution meaningless, take away the voters’ choice of who should have the powers of the governor, and eliminate the very separation of powers created by our Constitution.”

Konstantinos “Kosta” Diamantis, Connecticut’s former state deputy budget director, took the witness stand in federal court in Bridgeport on Thursday in an effort to fend off allegations that he used his position overseeing the state’s school building office to solicit tens of thousands of dollars in bribes from construction contractors.
For several hours, Diamantis testified about his past work on school construction projects in Connecticut and his relationship with three construction officials, all of whom have previously admitted in court to paying him bribes.
Federal prosecutors spent the first six days of the criminal trial presenting evidence that Diamantis had received payments from two officials with Acranom Masonry, which won multimillion-dollar contracts to help build schools in Hartford and Tolland.
Diamantis and his defense attorney, Norm Pattis, sought to explain away the emails, text messages and other direct evidence presented in the case. And they attempted to reshape the narrative that prosecutors put forward: that Diamantis eagerly traded his influence over school building projects for bribes and other favors from construction contractors.
“Mr. Diamantis will tell you he never took a bribe,” Pattis told the jury an opening statement. “And he will tell you he never used undue influence on school construction projects.” 
The only goal that Diamantis had as the head of Connecticut’s school construction program, Pattis argued, was to save taxpayers money. 
“He gave everything he had for the job he loved,” Pattis said. 
When he took the stand, Diamantis admitted that he accepted money from Acranom’s president Sal Monarca and vice president John Duffy, which the text messages in the case highlighted. But he said that money was not for helping the company win school construction contracts.
Instead, Diamantis said, he collected a “fee” for introducing Acranom’s leaders to the executives at D’Amato Construction, whom Diamantis is close friends with.
“Contractors are always looking to expand their network,” Diamantis said. 
“I made an introduction between John Duffy and D’Amato construction,” he added. 
Diamantis, who previously served in the legislature and practiced law, told the jury that he personally researched the state ethics code to determine if collecting that type of “fee” crossed the line.
That testimony stood in stark contrast to what Duffy and Monarca told the jury just days before. Both of them admitted under questioning that the money they delivered to Diamantis at a Dunkin’ Donuts, at his home and in restaurant bathroom were bribes that were meant to win them contracts on school construction projects.
Diamantis, who looked directly at the jury as he testified, challenged the prosecution’s assertion that he ruled the state’s school construction office with an iron first. And he repeatedly told the jury that he had no control over what companies got hired on school construction projects. 
He said that type of decision was up to local officials in Connecticut’s towns and cities.
“The state of Connecticut is not party to any of those contracts,” Diamantis said.  
That testimony also ran counter to what several local officials in Tolland and Hartford told the jury last week. The head of Hartford’s School Building Committee and the superintendent of Tolland schools said Diamantis told the municipalities what companies to hire in several instances.
They said they went along with those instructions because of the grip that Diamantis had on state funding for school construction projects.
At times, Diamantis’ answers to his attorney’s questions turned into history lessons about Connecticut’s school construction policies and his time in the state government. At one point, Diamantis named all of the people he managed in the school construction office.
Some of those answers stretched on for so long that prosecutors actually complained to the judge during a break that Diamantis’ testimony was irrelevant to the trial, and they said he seemed to be “filibustering” in order to drag out the trial for some reason. 
Anastasia Diamantis testifies
Diamantis’ daughter, Anastasia, was also called as a defense witness on Thursday to testify about the work she performed as an administrative assistant for Antonietta DiBenedetto Roy, the owner of Construction Advocacy Professionals, a firm that won several contracts for school projects in Tolland, Hartford and New Britain.
While being questioned by Pattis, Anastasia Diamantis said it was Roy who approached her and asked her to apply for the job at her firm. 
But under cross examination, she acknowledged to prosecutors that it was her father who encouraged Roy to contact her for the administrative assistant job. She also admitted that she asked Roy to pay her $20 per hour, but Roy chose to pay her $45 per hour instead.
Roy previously told the jury she paid a higher rate in order to keep Diamantis happy and to gain work on school construction projects. 
Diamantis told jurors that the federal investigation into his work within the state government had turned his life and that of his family’s into “a living hell.” 
“My family and myself have been dragged through the mud,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1006_SR_KostaTrialDay1_139-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-16 15:02:38.461865

Amy Rosenthal, executive director of the nonprofit Health Care For All, will join state government next month as undersecretary of health, the Executive Office of Health and Human Services announced Wednesday.
Rosenthal will step into the role Nov. 17, succeeding Kiame Mahaniah, who was elevated to secretary of health and human services this summer after former Health and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh stepped down.
Rosenthal is leaving Health Care For All as lawmakers look to the nonprofit to play a leading role in the effort to make sure people retain their health insurance.  The House on Wednesday passed legislation that allocates $10 million for a Health Care For All public awareness campaign to “inform vulnerable populations about new Medicaid work requirements put in place by the Federal Government.”
Rosenthal has led Health Care For All since 2017, expanding its size and sharpening its focus on health equity, community engagement and access to affordable health coverage, according to the organization. The nonprofit is a prominent voice for expanding subsidized insurance and preserving free preventive health care.
“Amy is the health policy leader and convener we need to drive creative solutions,” Mahaniah said in a statement released by the agency. “Her deep understanding of the people we serve – particularly access and affordability issues – and her strong relationships across the health care system in our state will serve Massachusetts residents well.”
Rosenthal previously spent more than a decade at the national advocacy group Community Catalyst, where she led campaigns to pass and defend the Affordable Care Act. 
She also worked in the Massachusetts Legislature in the Senate Post Audit and Oversight Bureau, on Democrat Myrth York’s unsuccessful run for governor of Rhode Island in 2002 and at pediatric hospitals on public health initiatives, according to LinkedIn. Since 2014, she has lectured at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Her appointment comes as the Healey administration continues to navigate high-level turnover. Walsh was one of six Cabinet members to announce their departure a little over halfway through Healey’s first term. Transportation Secretary Monica Tibbits-Nutt became the latest to resign Thursday morning.
Rosenthal’s appointment does not require legislative confirmation. She will report directly to Mahaniah.
Health Care For All on Thursday afternoon announced that Ashley Blackburn has been promoted to deputy executive director, a new and permanent leadership role, and will also serve as interim executive director while the board conducts a national search for a permanent executive director.
“The strong team at HCFA is unwavering in their commitment to the organization’s mission.

(Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Agriculture has informed states that there are insufficient funds to pay for SNAP benefits in November — unless Congress passes a spending bill by the end of the month.
SNAP benefits, also referred to as food stamps, help low-income families buy food. About 440,000 Minnesotans rely on SNAP. Most of them are children, seniors and people with disabilities. 
The Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families instructed counties to stop approving new SNAP applications, effective Wednesday. That means families in need won’t be able to get approved for benefits until the shutdown ends.
“Pausing even a single day of applications for SNAP benefits could delay approval for hungry kids and families who don’t have a day to spare,” Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul, said in a press release. 
Food shelves are worried about their ability to feed hungry families if benefits expire. Second Harvest Heartland, the state’s largest food bank, estimates that SNAP can provide nine times the amount of food as the food bank. Even small cuts to SNAP — let alone a complete expiration of funding — would have an outsized impact on the state’s emergency food system. 
The temporary lapse in funding comes amid other major changes to SNAP. A GOP mega-law signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4 will cut funding for SNAP by around 20%, or $187 billion over 10 years, in order to offset the cost of extending the tax breaks Trump spearheaded in his first term, in addition to some new ones.
The SNAP cuts come from expanded work requirements for parents of teenagers and people between the ages of 55 and 64; changes to how utility and internet bills are counted against an applicant’s income when determining benefits; and cost shifts to the states.
The law also eliminated the SNAP-Ed program, which educated SNAP recipients on healthy eating and how to lead a physically active lifestyle. Those cuts resulted in 60 layoffs at the University of Minnesota.
The new work requirements for SNAP are scheduled to take effect on Nov. 1.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-1287472642-2048x1365-1-1024x6831746533271-1.jpg,,,2025-10-16 15:02:38.461865

He lost his job months after he canceled a class “to mourn and process this racist fascist country"" when Donald Trump won another term as president.","After spending nearly a year living in professional limbo, former Millsaps College professor James Bowley was terminated from his tenured position in early September. But the saga that began on Nov. 6, 2024, after Bowley’s remarks in the wake of the presidential election, continues. 
Bowley, who taught religious studies, had emailed his class of three students telling them their class had been canceled, “to mourn and process this racist fascist country” after Republican Donald Trump won a second, non-consecutive term as president.  The very next day, Bowley was placed on paid administrative leave while the college reviewed his use of an institutional email account “to share personal opinions” with students. 
Throughout the tumultuous grievance and appeals process in the months that followed, Bowley has maintained he does not regret his actions. A faculty grievance committee recommended Bowley be restored, but the college administration and ultimately the board of trustees overruled its decision. 
Now, he’s taking Millsaps to court. 
In his lawsuit filed Sept. 26 in Hinds County Circuit Court, Bowley alleges the college violated its contractual obligations and promises by punishing him for his speech. 
For a tenured professor to be dismissed from employment, Millsaps’ faculty handbook requires documented evidence of “neglect, indifference, incompetence, professional or personal misconduct” that “substantially” impairs the faculty member’s fulfilment of their institutional responsibilities. In its initial decision to dismiss Bowley, the college claimed he was improperly grading assignments, that attendance was being incorrectly logged and that he was neglecting and routinely canceling one of his classes. 
Bowley’s lawsuit says the college fabricated those charges against him after already having made the decision to fire him for his email. 
“What they have done to me is censorship. There’s no other way to define it,” Bowley said in an interview with Mississippi Today. “Once they get away with censorship of one person, then everybody else either protests or self censors.”
A representative for Millsaps confirmed in a statement that the college was aware of the lawsuit. “We believe the facts of this matter will speak clearly during the court process ahead,” said Joey Lee, who is Millsaps’ director of communications and community engagement. 
Bowley’s termination and subsequent lawsuit come amid a nationwide battle over academic freedom, with a spate of faculty firings in universities such as the University of Mississippi, the University of South Dakota, Clemson University and Texas A&M University. There has been pushback by civil liberties organizations such as the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and the ACLU, some of which have also mounted legal challenges to these firings on First Amendment grounds.
“We are concerned that universities and colleges continue limiting the ability of professors to comment on important matters of public concern,” said Joshua Tom on behalf of the ACLU of Mississippi, clarifying that the organization was not commenting specifically on Bowley’s dismissal. “It is important especially in higher education for professors and students to be able to talk about and debate topics from different viewpoints. Firing people results in a shutdown of that opportunity and a worse academy.”
In the days since his termination, Bowley says, he has witnessed an outpouring of support, both from Millsaps alumni and other community groups, but still longs for justice from the courts. 
“I just do not want to be that person who bows down,” Bowley told Mississippi Today. “Freedom of speech, academic freedom – those principles, those ideas, are super important to me, and I’m willing to spend money and put time in to defend them.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/31153800/James-Bowley-5.jpg,,,2025-10-16 15:02:38.461865

Mallory McMorrow, who is a candidate for Michigan’s U.S. Senate seat, recently called the Israeli war in Gaza a genocide on the Palestinian people – a move that sparked a series of tough questions for her campaign on Wednesday evening during a forum focused on Arab and Muslim voters.
The event, hosted by Emgage Michigan, featured McMorrow and progressive candidate Abdul El-Sayed. U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), who is considered the Democratic establishment’s favorite in the race, did not attend the forum due to a scheduling conflict, her campaign said.
Stevens’ absence allowed McMorrow and El-Sayed a platform to answer questions posed by Emgage moderators, which for the most part focused on free speech and were questions fielded to both candidates so voters could compare their answers.

But the moderators took McMorrow to task with a series of individualized questions aimed at just her, almost exclusively related to her shifted stance on the genocide occuring in Gaza and reports that she filled out a position paper for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, the largest pro-Israel lobby in the United States.
Democratic candidates across the board, in Michigan and abroad, are getting hammered with questions about whether they would accept money or logistical support from AIPAC, which has funded candidates to the tune of millions of dollars. Several of those candidates who have received money from the committee have been friendly toward Israel, have voted in favor of sending defensive and offensive weapons to Israel in its war in Gaza, and have refused to call Israel’s actions a genocide.
Stevens has reportedly accepted a sum total of $5.17 million from the organization, according to AIPACTracker, which tallies money spent on candidates through the PAC.
In Michigan,  Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist was among the few gubernatorial candidates willing to plainly call the Gaza situation a genocide, and he did so recently at a national Arab American convention held in Dearborn.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
El-Sayed was early in his support for Palestine, has called the situation a genocide since the launch of his U.S. Senate bid and has said publicly that he would not accept money from AIPAC.
McMorrow’s stance became clearer earlier this month. On a brewery tour stop, McMorrow was pressed with a question on Gaza and accepting money from AIPAC.
The state senator from Royal Oak said that she would not be accepting money from AIPAC, not now or in the future, nor was she seeking its endorsement.
She also called the war and the strife there a “moral abomination.” When asked if she would call it a genocide, McMorrow, after a deep breath and long pause, said it was by definition a genocide.
That news of McMorrow’s opinion on Gaza was blunted, so to speak, by an article published by Dropsite News, a Substack blog covering national politics and foreign affairs. The blog reported in September that McMorrow had privately produced an AIPAC position paper that at least one pro-Israel donor said was “outstanding.” Those details came from a donor call obtained by Drop Site news, which was also published online.
McMorrow clarifies stance on Gaza, joins Michigan Democrats calling situation a genocide

On Wednesday, Emgage moderators at the event asked about McMorrow’s response to the Gaza question during her brewery tour. The senator was asked if she was willing to go beyond rhetoric and support blocking weapons sales to Israel if elected to the U.S. Senate. She was also asked if she would impose sanctions on Israel, and if her response to the question was genuine, as opposed to well-timed due to the changing view on Gaza.
McMorrow said she appreciated the question, and that the north star on her moral compass was rooted in believing that no life was worth more than any other.
“I am somebody who is married to a Jewish man who feels deeply about what is happening in the Middle East and also still faces scars from having family members who were killed in the Holocaust,” McMorrow said. “I understand how much pain there is. And after Oct. 7, 2023 as the war raged on, it got worse. I don’t know how anybody could look at photos and videos of what we saw coming out of Gaza and not be absolutely heartbroken at the starvation, at the suffering, and realizing this was not just about retaliation, it got so much worse.”
McMorrow said her position was that the United States should use “every tool at its disposal, especially in this moment now, where there is a very tentative cease fire, to ensure that this is a permanent cease fire, it’s not another fleeting one, and that Palestinians can have long term peace and security.”
In the Dropsite News article, McMorrow said she wanted to be clear that what she’s said in public is the same rhetoric that she espouses behind closed doors.
“You can view my position on my website. You can view it in public statements. I do anywhere from half a dozen to a dozen public events every single week, and we have hard conversations in the room on my statewide brewery tour,” McMorrow said. “I am proud to say that no question is off limits, and we talk about this frequently, but we have to acknowledge that in our state, we have Arab American communities, Muslim American communities and Jewish American communities. Some members of our community are involved with AIPAC. I believe in meeting with everybody.”
McMorrow also said she did not intend to seek AIPAC‘s support or endorsement, not even from the very beginning.
“But I believe in meeting with everybody, because we have been able to have these difficult conversations and bring together what is a shared goal of a permanent cease fire of the violence, ending of the killing,” she said. “Is that going to be everybody’s position? No, but what I say in private is exactly what I say in public.”

Tommy Tuberville Thursday praised President Donald Trump; accused Democrats of bringing the federal governor shutdown and outlined several goals he wanted to accomplish should he be elected governor.
Speaking to the Montgomery Area Chamber of Commerce on Thursday, Alabama’s senior U.S. senator said “we all need to come together,” then provided an update on the government shutdown where he said he would “blame people on the left for this.”
Republicans, who control the House and the Senate, have not been able to overcome a filibuster on a budget resolution from Democrats, who want Affordable Care Act tax credits extended to the end of the year and guarantees that the Trump administration will spend allocated money as intended. The federal government shutdown is in its third week.
Tuberville said he voted for a continuing resolution to reopen the government and retain the current funding levels even though the budget spends $2 trillion more than what the government collects in revenue to allow Social Security payments and payments to military personnel.
He added that he firmly rejected the budget that Democrats have proposed, falsely saying that immigrants without status in this country receive federal health care benefits.
“If we continue to fund, educate, give health care, to people in this country who don’t pay taxes, who are here illegally, we won’t make it,” Tuberville said. “They want to do that. Our health care has got a long way to go to be improved. We have got good health care, not great. But at the end of the day, we cannot afford to pay for people who are not citizens of this country.”
Immigrants without status may not purchase Affordable Care Act plans through exchanges and are not eligible for Medicaid, Medicare or CHIP. Immigrants with status face eligibility restrictions for Medicaid and CHIP, and many must be legally present for five years before accessing benefits. All immigrants pay sales taxes.
President Joe Biden’s administration applied enhanced tax credits for people who purchase health insurance through ACA exchanges, reducing the cost of accessing health care. If the credits expire,  health insurance premiums for ACA recipients could more than double.
The tax credits are tied to income and will affect many lower income households.
According to a study published in September by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a person who currently earns $28,000 annually can expect to pay roughly $325 for a silver plan through the exchange. However, if the tax credits expire, the premium increases to $1,562.
Tuberville also praised Trump for imposing tariffs while acknowledging that they  are hurting domestic farmers.
“President Trump, he is a smart guy,” Tuberville said. “He understands it. He is not doing it to punish the American people. He is doing it to help the American people. Sometimes, you have to take a step back before you go forward.”
Prior to that statement, Tuberville said that the tariffs have placed a burden on American farmers, particularly with the trading relationship with China regarding soybeans.
“China normally buys 700 million bushels of soybeans from the United States of America,” Tuberville said. “Our soybean farmers have benefitted from that to some degree. You know how many they are buying this year; zero. Our soybean farmers are in trouble; they are in trouble.”
Throughout the address, Tuberville said he will improve Alabama’s education system when he is elected governor by incorporating vocational training into the curriculum in high schools.
“We need to start workforce development after the 10th grade,” Tuberville said. “Kids will have the opportunity to learn a skill or a trade, whether it is welding or plumbing or as an electrician. We have to get in on this because if we don’t, we are going to have to bring people in from other countries to do our jobs for us. That is not what we want.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251016_090716-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-16 15:02:38.461865

After a two-plus-year tenure dotted with both achievements and controversies, Tibbits-Nutt stepped down and Gov. Maura Healey turned to Eng — now one of the governor’s most trusted deputies — to fill the hole on an interim basis. 
Healey also promoted Highway Administrator Jonathan Gulliver, another veteran highly regarded among transportation insiders, to undersecretary as part of the shakeup. Like Eng, Gulliver will retain his prior role while gaining additional responsibilities. 
The staffing overhaul significantly changes the makeup atop MassDOT more than halfway into Healey’s term, just a bit more than a year before she is up for reelection.  
Healey’s office said Tibbits-Nutt “plans to return to private industry” and will continue to serve as an advisor through the end of the year, but otherwise did not provide any additional details about the reason for her departure.  
Tibbits-Nutt notched several transformative milestones, including the launch of a new low-income fare option on the MBTA and receipt of a nearly $1 billion federal grant toward a project to replace the Sagamore Bridge. She also drew ire over candid comments she made about tolling at the state’s borders and was caught up in a major fight about how the department awarded a lucrative contract to operate highway service plazas. 
Healey said Thursday she did not ask Tibbits-Nutt to step down. Asked if the secretary left because of the service plaza controversy or her highly scrutinized remarks at a Walk Massachusetts event in 2024, Healey replied, “No, absolutely not.” 
“We’ve been with Secretary Tibbits-Nutt for a while, and we wish her all the best in her next chapter as she moves back to private industry,” Healey told reporters at an unrelated event. 
Healey’s decision is a ringing endorsement of Eng, whom she described as the most important appointment of her tenure when she hired him in March 2023. He arrived with the MBTA largely in disarray after years of deferred maintenance and safety problems; while the agency still faces a slew of obstacles today, service has improved and public confidence in the T  is trending upward. 
“Over the last [two] and a half years, Phil Eng has demonstrated that he’s a terrific manager. He gets it done,” Healey said. “The trains are running on time, and a lot has happened because of his leadership and his management. I expect he’ll bring that same level of management and leadership statewide.” 
It’s also a sign of confidence in Gulliver, whom Healey’s office described as the longest-serving highway administrator. 
Eng will not receive any extra pay for his work as interim transportation secretary, a Healey spokesperson said. Last year, he earned a total of $546,684 as MBTA general manager, according to state payroll data. 
It’s not clear how long he will hold both roles. Eng said he is “open to holding [the interim job] as long as it’s needed,” and has not had any discussions about taking over as secretary on a permanent basis. 
“I’m taking it day by day,” Healey said. “In evaluating what to do in the wake of Secretary Tibbits-Nutts’s departure, I thought Phil was the right person for the job. I’m focused right now in the immediate on getting him onboarded.” 
“Obviously, an interim can’t last forever, but we’re going to take that all as it comes,” she added. 
Both Healey and Eng said they are confident he will not be spread too thin, suggesting the additional duties would not have been offered and accepted if they posed too heavy a load. 
“I intend to stay just as engaged as I’ve been with [the] MBTA, and I know that doesn’t sound feasible, but it is,” Eng said. “They know what they’re doing. MassDOT people know what they’re doing.  What I’ve done is really empower them. Once we’re all moving in the same direction, I don’t need to be told every single thing. We know how to operate.” 
MBTA Advisory Board Executive Director Brian Kane, who represents municipalities that help fund the T, praised Tibbits-Nutt for her work and said he hopes Eng’s tenure as interim will be short so he can return his attention to trains, buses, trolleys, and ferries. 
The one-two pairing of Eng, a “train guy,” and Gulliver, a “highway guy,” should help balance the department’s work, Kane said.

“Phil’s a safe pair of hands. If anything has been shown in the last two years, it’s that he can handle it,” he said. “He used to work for [the New York Department of Transportation]. He has the experience. He knows how to run bridges and roads and highways. I think he’s the right call.” 
Still, Kane said the decision to give additional responsibility to Eng and Gulliver — who are already responsible for two of the largest workloads in state government — reflects a “short bench” within MassDOT. 
It’s not the first time a member of Healey’s Cabinet has held two roles at once. Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler spent a few months also working as interim commissioner of the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education before Pedro Martinez started on the job. 
After spending years on the Fiscal and Management Control Board that oversaw MBTA operations, Tibbits-Nutt started in the Healey administration as an undersecretary. She took on the top job on an interim basis following the abrupt resignation of Transportation Secretary Gina Fiandaca in August 2023, and officials dropped the “acting” part of the title a few months later. 
While she had the backing of many transportation activists, her approach to the job ruffled some feathers, especially after she signaled an openness to raising fees on ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft and expanding tolls to the state’s borders — an idea Healey quickly rebuked. 
“Governor Healey should have fired Secretary Tibbits-Nutt the moment she declared she wanted to ‘go after anyone who has money’ and vowed to create more and raise tolls across the Commonwealth,” Republican gubernatorial candidate Mike Kennealy said Thursday in response to the MassDOT baton-pass. “The era of appointing extreme progressive activists to run our government and tax our citizens into leaving Massachusetts will end when I’m Governor. It’s time for leadership that values competence, accountability, and affordability – not ideological crusades.” 
Eng is now the third person to hold the job of transportation secretary on an interim or permanent basis since Healey took office in January 2023.  
Tibbits-Nutt becomes the latest in a string of cabinet members heading for the exit, following former Health and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh, former Economic Development Secretary Yvonne Hao, retired Public Safety Secretary Terrence Reidy, and Veterans Services Secretary Jon Santiago, who plans to step down this fall. 
“I think it’s normal if you look back at other administrations,” Healey said of the turnover. “These are hard jobs. These are really hard jobs, and I’m just really grateful to the strength and the quality of all who have served.” 
Eng will now lead MassDOT as the department attempts to chart a path forward for highway service plaza operations. 
Earlier this year, officials awarded a 35-year contract for redevelopment and management of the plazas to Irish retailer Applegreen. That set off a political firestorm, with losing bidder Global Partners mounting an all-out offensive that included intense public pressure and a lawsuit alleging their rivals had an unfair leg up. 
Applegreen dropped out of lease negotiations, and MassDOT opted this week to redo the bidding process rather than turn to Global. 
Eng said the initial procurement “was done in a transparent way.” 
“Having said that, one of the things that I’ve been focused on at the T and I’m going to focus on at MassDOT is: How do we get more competition? How do we get more interest in doing these projects? And was that structured in a way that maybe we can change it a little bit to encourage more bidders?” he said. 
“We’re going to take the next couple of months as we prepare for the procurement and really look at what the market can do, where we think we can do better, maybe specify some different things in our procurement documents,” Gulliver added. “We’re really going to be evaluating all the different options, and our goal is to deliver the best service plazas for the travelers in Massachusetts and at the best value for taxpayers.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10-16_Eng_presser_2-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-16 15:02:38.461865

(Courtesy of Sioux Falls School District)A South Dakota board voted on Thursday to expand teaching scholarships for areas of critical need to cover all prospective K-12 teachers, in response to teacher shortages around the state.
Currently, South Dakota’s Critical Teaching Needs Scholarship targets college students studying for specific teaching fields such as special education, high school math and science, and career and technical education. Awardees must maintain a 2.8 grade-point average and teach in the state for five years. 
“You could argue that any certified teaching position, right now, remains in a shortage,” state Department of Education Secretary Joseph Graves said during the virtual meeting of the Critical Teaching Needs Scholarship Board. 
South Dakota’s ACT score declines but outperforms similar states and national average

State officials presented data showing persistent turnover and vacancies across nearly all teaching disciplines. At the end of the 2023-24 school year, public school districts reported 1,178 full-time equivalent instructors no longer employed, and at the start of the current school year, 137 full-time equivalent teaching positions were unfilled statewide.
The scholarship board agreed that narrowing eligibility no longer makes sense when most districts are struggling to attract applicants.
Parkston Superintendent Patrick Mikkonen said “there is just no candidate pool” for his school district in southeastern South Dakota. 
“I can’t get anything, as far as an applicant,” he told the board.
The board approved a motion to open the scholarship to all K-12 teacher education students and to make it auto-renewable for recipients who maintain the required GPA. Currently, students have to reapply after the first year. 
Twelve students were awarded a combined total of $120,732 in scholarships for the 2023-24 school year, an average of about $10,000 per student. The funding comes from interest earned on the state’s Education Enhancement Trust Fund. 
The state’s Critical Teaching Needs Scholarship application window opens on Nov. 1 and closes on Dec. 15.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Supreme Court Chief Justice Marla Luckert likely suffered a stroke, doctors determined after she was involved in a minor traffic accident.
Luckert, 70, was elevated to chief justice in 2019 and has been on the state’s highest court since appointed by Republican Gov. Bill Graves and sworn into office in 2003.
In a statement, Luckert said the accident occurred Oct. 9 while driving home from work.
“Fortunately, I did not hit any other vehicle or hurt anyone,” she said. “Doctors believe I had a stroke, which caused the accident.”
Luckert was hospitalized for several days and is recuperating at home while on medical leave from the Supreme Court.
“It does not appear that I will need speech or physical therapy, but I have been ordered to rest for at least the next few weeks,” her statement said. “I’m resting comfortably at home.”
Luckert expressed gratitude for prayers, expressions of concern and warm thoughts about her situation. She said she would release public updates in the future.
Luckert was born in Goodland and earned a law degree at Washburn University in Topeka. She worked in private practice for more than a decade. Democratic Gov.

The program helped over 8,000 households keep warm last winter, but can only provide a fraction of that assistance now. 
The post Low-income Wyomingites shut out of heating help during shutdown appeared first on WyoFile .","The federal government shutdown has forced state officials to pause a program that helps thousands of Wyoming residents stay warm in the winter.  
The Wyoming Low Income Energy Assistance Program helps eligible households by paying a portion of their winter home heating costs. However, the Wyoming Department of Family Services, which administers the program, has halted approval of new applications because it has run out of federal funding.
The stoppage comes as temperatures in Wyoming have begun plunging into the 30s as winter approaches.
“The program has been paused because there are no remaining federal funds to authorize new benefit payments or to approve applicants until Congress passes a spending bill, the federal government reopens, and funding has been received by DFS,” according to a press release from the agency. 
When the application window opened in September, the department experienced high call volumes. That may have been related to Rocky Mountain Power’s rate hike, Kelly Douglas, a DFS spokesperson, told WyoFile. 
Before the funding ran out, DFS was able to approve 1,168 households for this winter. Those residents will be supported through May. However, they represent just a fraction of the 8,236 households the program was able to assist last season. 
“This is hard for them,” Douglas said. “And we are doing our best. At DFS, we work directly with clients, and we understand the hardship. And it’s been hard.”
While approvals are paused, Douglas said new applicants should continue to submit applications and respond to requests from DFS for additional information. That way, Douglas said, delays can be minimized once the federal government reopens and the agency receives funding. The federal shutdown has already lasted two weeks, and there is little sign in Washington that things will change anytime soon.
The department is looking to community partners in the meantime to help bridge the gap. 
“Sometimes crisis prevention can be as simple as food on the table and heat in the house,” Douglas said. “We know this can help with all kinds of crises that come down the line. So we really work for concrete support for our families and individuals that need that extra boost.” 
Both renters and homeowners can qualify for the program, but must meet the income requirement of no more than 60% of the state median income level. The amount awarded is based on several factors, including energy needs, income and family size. The program prioritizes households with children 5 years old and younger, residents who are 60 and older, as well as residents who are disabled. 
Republicans and Democrats appeared no closer to an agreement on Thursday when the Senate again failed to advance a bill to reopen the government. A split between the two parties over extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act marketplaces — which drastically reduce health insurance premium costs — led in part to the current shutdown. 
Between 11,000-20,000 Wyoming residents are at risk of losing their coverage due to the anticipated cost increases, according to Healthy Wyoming. 
Republicans have promised to discuss health care subsidies once the government is funded, but Democrats have rejected that, insisting instead on legislation.

Davids says she is planning to take legal action if Republicans gerrymander her district. (Chloe Anderson for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas’ lone Democratic congresswoman is preparing legal strategies to fight Republican redistricting efforts in court, should the need arise.
U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, whose 3rd District seat is the target of a proposed November special session in Kansas, told reporters Wednesday she will fight efforts by Republicans to shift voting districts.
The special session will only take place if 84 of the 88 House Republicans sign on, and legislators have indicated they are short a few votes.
“Instead of changing their policies, they’re changing the rules,” Davids said. “Let’s call this what it is. It’s cheating. Most Kansans might not know what gerrymandering is, but they do understand what cheating is, and they know when something isn’t fair.”
Davids said she will take steps should the redistricting occur.
“We’re absolutely gearing up and will be ready to fight this in court if they continue down this road and are able to get a redistricting or gerrymandering done,” she said.
When the Kansas Legislature changed district maps in 2022, also targeting Davids’ seat, the congresswoman said she challenged the changes in court. Although she didn’t win, the changes Republicans made in the Kansas City-area district did not unseat Davids. She won reelection that year by a wider margin than before, then won her fourth congressional term in 2024. 
As a former MMA fighter, Davids said that whether she’s in the cage or the halls of Congress, she wants to win but she wants to do so “fair and square.”
“It’s not fair to Kansans to manipulate district boundaries just to give one political party more power, and it sure isn’t fair to Kansans to take marching orders from Washington extremists instead of listening to Kansans that you’re supposed to be serving,” she said. 
“This is a blatant power grab,” Davids added. 
A Republican contingent traveled to Washington, D.C., this week to meet with President Donald Trump. Although Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, said redistricting was not on the agenda, Davids believed it would be discussed. 
“All of this is happening behind closed doors, which is one of the one of the more frustrating parts about this,” she said. “We know that the Republican legislators are coming out to the White House and are going to get their marching orders, but Kansans have yet to see what their plan is. I can’t tell you what the future steps look like.”
A photo posted on social media showed 34 Kansas House and Senate Republicans posing with thumbs up for a group photo behind a sign that read “White House State Leadership Conference.”
A separate photo showed a program agenda that included meetings with various Trump administration officials, including White House deputy chief of staff James Blair and White House Office of Political Affairs director Matt Brasseaux. The others were Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner, Kelly Loeffler of the Small Business Administration, and White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs director Alex Meyer.
Earlier this week, Johnson County community leaders spoke out against redistricting efforts at a rally in Mission.
To drive Davids out of office, a new map would have to fracture Johnson County into two or three districts.
“Johnson County is the economic engine of Kansas,” said Tiffany Stovall, CEO of Kansas Manufacturing Solutions. “Splitting up our region — which leads the state in economic power — threatens our business community. Our workforce, our community, our families are all interconnected. Dividing us just so politicians can hand-pick their voters is wrong.”
Laurel Burchfield, advocacy director of Mainstream Coalition, which helped organize the Tuesday night rally, said she hoped the event would signal community opposition to any plan to “rig the system.”
“Our elected officials’ job is to listen to us and try to help make life better for families,” Burchfield said. “But when districts are manipulated and gerrymandered to make elections less competitive, officials listen less to voters, and more to special interest groups.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/KVP-09-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-16 15:02:38.461865

Ciattarelli said the NJ governor should work with Trump.,"The future of the Gateway project, which would build two new rail tunnels under the Hudson River, is again in doubt after President Trump said Wednesday he is terminating billions in infrastructure projects for New York. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)The massive project to fund construction of new Hudson River rail tunnels again took center stage in our gubernatorial race Thursday, a day after President Trump said he was terminating New York-based infrastructure projects because of Democratic opposition to a GOP federal budget bill.
Democrats widely believe Trump’s comments in part target the Gateway project, two new rail tunnels to bring trains across the Hudson River and replace 115-year-old tunnels that regularly snarl rail traffic into and out of New York City.
Democrat Mikie Sherrill, a four-term congresswoman hoping to be elected governor on Nov. 4, appeared at the Secaucus train station Thursday to take aim at her Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, arguing he would do little to curb Trump on issues like Gateway. Ciattarelli has said on the campaign trail that if elected, his attorney general would not sue Trump over presidential executive orders.
“In order to get good results for people, you have to fight back. You have to be willing to go toe-to-toe. You have to be willing to have your AG take him to court. My opponent has pledged never to take the administration to court. He says he agrees with everything the president does,” Sherrill said.
Governor Murphy’s energy policy scrutinized as his two terms wrap up

Ciattarelli has argued that New Jersey’s chief executive should work with Trump, not in opposition to him. He echoed those thoughts on social media Wednesday following Trump’s remarks.
“New Jersey needs a Governor who has the standing to work with, and when necessary disagree with, the President and advocate for New Jersey’s fair share of federal tax dollars — including the Gateway Tunnel,” Ciattarelli said. “This is a critical infrastructure project and I will fight to get it done.”
Trump, whose administration two weeks ago said it would freeze federal funding for the $16 billion tunnel project and for New York City’s replacement of the 2nd Avenue Subway, said during a press conference Wednesday that numerous “Democrat projects” are being terminated because of the federal budget impasse.
“The project in Manhattan, the project in New York, it’s billions and billions of dollars that Schumer has worked 20 years to get — it’s terminated. Tell him it’s terminated,” Trump said, referring to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York).
He said the White House was terminating programs on a “permanent basis.” The U.S. Department of Transportation, which administers the funding, and the Office of Management and Budget, which Trump said made the rescission, did not immediately return requests for comment.
A spokesperson for the Gateway Development Commission, a bistate agency tasked with overseeing the Hudson tunnel project, declined to comment, as did a spokesperson for NJ Transit, whose trains run through the existing 115-year-old tunnels into New York.
The mechanism used for the termination is unclear, as is whether Gateway may continue to receive funding.
The Gateway project has topped Sherrill’s list of priorities since before she was elected to Congress in 2018. On Thursday, she stressed the project’s importance to the regional economy and residents’ quality of life.
“This is critical, and it’s critical to the economy of the United States, but it’s also critical to the men and women who commute every single day because without these improvements, it means continuing to miss dinner, to miss soccer games, to not be able to coach teams, to not get time with your family. It’s a quality-of-life issue day after day,” she said.
Laborers International Union of North America Vice President and Eastern Regional Manager Mike Hellstrom, whose members work on the Gateway project and whose union has endorsed Sherrill, on Thursday said already disbursed funds could support the project for about 45 days.
Once that money is spent, the project would face $1 million in daily costs and potential lawsuits over contract violations related to a work stoppage spurred by funding lapses, he said.

,California,2025-10-16 18:00:37+00:00,CalMatters,"Cal State workers are getting a one-time bonus, paid for by a $144 million loan due next year",Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/10/cal-state-loan/,The $144 million loan will be used to pay for one-time bonuses for faculty and staff.,"In summary
The $144 million loan will be used to pay for one-time bonuses for faculty and staff. 


The California State University system will seek a state loan of $144 million that it’ll have a year to repay at no interest, even though current projections show the system will have to add to its deficit to repay the debt.Cal State’s chief financial officer says the loan will be used to offer one-year bonuses to faculty and staff. While salaries vary widely across the system, the extra $144 million is roughly a 3% increase in the total pay for Cal State’s workers, including executives. State law says the loan needs to be repaid by next July.Despite months of hesitation, the system today took the first step to request the loan and will likely get the money in 60 days or less, said Cal State’s interim chief financial officer, Patrick Lenz, in an interview. The process involves approval from state lawmakers, who are likely to support the move.State lawmakers made the loan available to Cal State after they cut state funding to the system by $144 million this year. Cal State has 22 campuses and enrolls 460,000 students.
The system’s largest union, the California Faculty Association of 30,000 workers, is cheering this decision but says more work is needed to bring back lecturers whose contracts were cancelled as many campuses contend with shrinking budgets. The union’s contract is expiring but negotiators from the union and Cal State leadership haven’t met since April.“We will take this as a win, but we have so much work to do, and I do hope that this provides an opening for the management to come to the table with us and negotiate fairly,” said Elaine Bernal, a lecturer at the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Cal State Long Beach and senior member of the faculty association.“The one-time investment, great, but we really got to focus on long-term investment,” she said.The Legislature intends to increase state spending for Cal State in 2026-27 by just $101 million — far lower than previous promises from Gov. Gavin Newsom of about $250 million — so the system will effectively be $43 million short once it repays the loan, Lenz said. The decision to take the loan came “after careful deliberation, conversations with the chancellor, conversations with our Board of Trustees,” Lenz said.
Money is chronically tight at CSU. Since 2023 the system has battled ongoing deficits that have led to hundreds of degree and course cuts, fewer lecturers and hiring freezes. Back then, the system said it was spending $1.5 billion less than it should to adequately educate its students.
Over the past two years that figure has grown by several hundred million dollars as costs rise for campus utilities, insurance, health benefits and more. The deficits exist even as the system in 2024 began increasing tuition annually; the added costs outweigh the new revenue from charging students more. However, most students don’t pay tuition because of state and system financial aid.
Despite those fiscal pressures and likely new expenses to replace the Trump administration’s cuts to federal education grants, Lenz said system leaders want to spend the money on workers.
Unions wanted loan
The zero-interest loan has been the source of intrigue and scrutiny since July as unions representing Cal State workers have been pressuring the system to agree to borrow the money so campuses can offer pay increases for workers. Unions and some lawmakers argued that the the system was fully funded because the state budget gave CSU the option to borrow the loan, which should trigger collective bargaining contract language that stipulated that ongoing raises would kick in if the system received an increase in state funding.But Cal State officials say that even if they take the loan, it’s not new or ongoing funding — it’s money they’d have to repay after a year — so the system isn’t obligated to increase wages like those contracts dictate.Lenz reiterated that point during an interview, even after indicating the system will take out the loan.“Clearly, anything that is one time is not ongoing,” he said of the loan. So any raise “would be only for the 12 months of the budget year.” But maybe the state will send more cash to the system than what lawmakers and Newsom signaled in the annual budget deal they solidified in June, Lenz said. He also suggested that CSU could negotiate more time to repay the loan.“There’s a long way to go in this process, and there’s a lot of unknowns,” he said.
How CSU got here
That the loan even exists is itself an example of curious budgeting tactics by lawmakers and  Newsom. Last year they passed a state budget that gave Cal State a moderate increase in state funding with a warning of huge cuts of $375 million this July — equal to about 8% of what the state spends supporting the CSU.After a half-year of fierce advocacy from Cal State officials, students and workers, the final 2025-26 budget approved in June applied just a 3% cut to CSU, with a promise that the cut — $144 million — would be restored in the 2026-27 budget year that begins next July. To help Cal State manage its finances this fiscal year, the state said the system could borrow $144 million this year and repay it by the end of June 2026.The loan option was extended to multiple state agencies, including the University of California.
System budget leaders, including Lenz, in July expressed wariness over taking out the loan because if the state’s budget picture remains shaky — it’s already projecting billions of dollars in deficits — then lawmakers may decide to apply further cuts to the CSU. That means the system would be in a deeper deficit and be on the hook for a loan they couldn’t repay.
The fiscal malaise could have been worse. In 2022, Newsom promised the CSU and University of California five years of increasing budget support totaling more than $1 billion for each system in new, ongoing funding. But because of state budget constraints, that so-called “compact” has only been partially funded. And new funding pain points are likely on the horizon. Congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump approved spending plans that Newsom says will kick millions of low-income Californians off public health insurance. If the state plans to pay for that care, budgets for other agencies, especially those that can raise tuition, may need to decrease.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/050625_CSU-San-Marcos_AH_CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-16 14:03:19.432967

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)McCOOK, Neb. — Thirteen McCook residents filed a lawsuit this week to stop Nebraska officials from converting a state prison into an immigration detention facility with the backing of a former lawmaker who helped pass the law directing the state’s use of the facility.
The 24-page lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Red Willow County District Court, argues Gov. Jim Pillen’s in-progress plan to convert the Work Ethic Camp in McCook would “usurp” legislative authority and violate separation of powers under the Nebraska Constitution and state law. Pillen and Rob Jeffreys, director of Nebraska’s correctional system, are named in the case.
“Nebraska state law is clear: The governor does not have the unilateral authority to change the purpose of any public building,” said Robert McEwen, legal director of Nebraska Appleseed, which is leading the case. “That’s the Legislature’s job.”
Nebraska Appleseed is a nonprofit organization advocating for people in need, including immigrants.
‘Supreme executive power’
Pillen and state and federal officials announced plans on Aug. 19 to repurpose the Work Ethic Camp from a state prison offering rehabilitative programming for low-risk felony offenders to a “Midwest hub” for immigration enforcement. Pillen and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem have sought to rebrand the facility as the “Cornhusker Clink.”
Pillen, at that time, said the facility would remain state-owned and operated and be operational by mid-October. Earlier this week, he said it would instead be operational by November.


Alleged violations of the separation of powers
Nebraska Constitution: “The general management, control and government of all state charitable, mental, reformatory, and penal institutions shall be vested as determined by the Legislature.”
Nebraska state law: “Any public building that is erected or repaired and for which an appropriation is made by the Legislature shall be constructed or repaired in a complete manner within the limits of such appropriation. Except as provided in sections 72-811 to 72-818 and 79-11,109, no building shall be changed or diverted from the use or purpose, kind, or class of building from that for which the appropriation was originally made.”


“There’s some little details, but everything’s been moving in great progress,” Pillen said Tuesday, according to reporting by KETV. “We’re really excited about it.”
Pillen has previously argued state law gives him authority through the creation of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, plus a clause in the Nebraska Constitution that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.”
Spokespeople for the Nebraska Governor’s Office, Nebraska Attorney General’s Office and Nebraska Department of Correctional Services had no immediate comment on the lawsuit Thursday.
Following the money
The lead plaintiff, DiAnna Schimek of Lincoln, served in the Nebraska Legislature between 1989 and 2009, including as chair of the Legislature’s Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee. She was one of 41 lawmakers who approved the Work Ethic Camp in 1997 at the request of then-Gov. Ben Nelson, a McCook native and the state’s last Democratic governor. 
The facility was meant to reduce prison crowding by moving out low-risk offenders and making space for more violent offenders elsewhere. The Work Ethic Camp opened in 2001, and since then, the Legislature has repeatedly appropriated state funds to keep up the facility. 
As of last year, the facility had a state budget of at least $9.5 million and about 85 staff, according to September 2024 state budget documents.
Schimek and the 13 McCook residents argue that without legislative approval, Pillen, Jeffreys and other officials can’t convert the facility or use state funds other than how lawmakers have specified. The lawsuit also states the Corrections Department has authority over state prisoners, not non-citizens awaiting civil proceedings seeking to deport them.
The Corrections Department contracted with Outback Fence, a Lincoln-based fencing company, paying $750,000 to install a 12-foot razor-topped fence at the prison by the end of the month, with at least $187,500 already spent, according to the lawsuit.

To get their feet in the courthouse door, Schimek and the McCook residents argue the case concerns an unlawful expenditure of public funds and a “matter of great public concern.”
Lawyers on behalf of Schimek and the McCook residents sent a demand letter Tuesday to the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office, asking that the “unlawful” actions stop. The plaintiffs had threatened to sue by Wednesday if those demands were ignored or rejected.
“Without an injunction, the plaintiffs will suffer substantial, irreparable harm, which is a hardship that outweighs any hardship the defendants may face,” the lawsuit states. 
While many public records requests seeking information about the state-federal plan have been denied, documents released to a government watchdog group indicated that negotiations between Nebraska and federal officials started in March or sooner, while the Legislature was still in session.
McCook residents speak out
In separate affidavits, Schimek and the 13 McCook residents attested to their concerns about the state-federal plan, expressing concern about not having an opportunity to participate in the policy decision before Pillen and others acted.
“I am concerned about the community that I live in becoming a more toxic environment as a result of the WEC being repurposed to become an immigration detention center,” Catherine McDowell of McCook said in her affidavit.
Dale Dueland, a 49-year resident of Red Willow County, said he is an active volunteer for community and civic organizations in McCook. He said his focus has been on building McCook into a “thriving rural community.” He wrote that he worried about “irreversible damage to the economic development and community growth that I have spent my whole life working to build.”
“Specifically, I am concerned that the repurposing of the WEC to be an immigration detention center will negatively impact local businesses, home values and create reputational harm to the organizations that I have served,” Dueland continued.

Some McCook residents expressed concern for McCook children and the “toxic public dialogue” or “fear” the decision had already caused. Ronda Graff said she worried the prison’s repurposing would undermine long-time efforts to create a “welcoming, friendly and engaging community.”
Many inmates work in the community, and multiple residents said they appreciate those connections. Will Branham, a member of the McCook Arts Council, said inmates have contributed to the growth of McCook’s arts scene. Matt Sehnert said he’s spoken with men at Work Ethic Camp about career prospects and that they appreciate being seen as “valuable human beings.” 
“It was clear to me that the men took great pride in working to improve our community,” Sehnert said in his affidavit.
State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, a member of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, also submitted an affidavit as part of the lawsuit regarding information he had gathered from the executive branch.
The lawsuit seeks preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to halt the state-federal plan and prevent officials from pursuing a similar plan or contract without proper legislative authority. 
Red Willow County District Judge Patrick Heng denied the initial request for a temporary restraining order but will hear the case during a Thursday afternoon hearing.

Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins said Wednesday she strongly supports the nomination of David St. Pierre to fill the position that acts as the enforcement arm for federal courts. His nomination will need to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. 
St. Pierre served in the Lewiston Police Department for more than 30 years, including as the chief of police from 2021 until his retirement last month. While at the helm of the department, he led nearly 100 employees and managed a budget of more than $10 million. He had a central role in coordinating the local, state and federal officers who responded to the state’s deadliest mass shooting in October 2023 in his home court.
“His steady leadership during the most challenging moment in Maine’s recent history, the tragic mass shooting of 2023, demonstrated his professionalism, composure, and deep commitment to both public safety and public service,” she said in a statement. “With his extensive experience and unique skill set, I am confident that Chief St. Pierre will serve the people of Maine admirably as U.S. Marshal.”
Having graduated in 2018 from the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Virginia, St. Pierre is an active member of the FBI National Academy Associates. He’s also a member of the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Maine Chiefs of Police Association.

This is a marked change from former Superintendent Ryan Walters who attended only one meeting this year, according to an Oklahoma Voice analysis of meeting minutes. The same analysis found him to be chronically absent from other boards he had a seat on as state superintendent. 
As state superintendent, Lindel Fields also serves as the chair of the state Board of Career and Technology Education. Fields was appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt on Oct. 2 to replace former Walters, who resigned to lead a conservative teacher organization. 
Fields, a retired CareerTech administrator, said having an amicable relationship between the agencies will help them work together and he “doesn’t know any other way” to operate. 
“Attending this meeting is really important,” he said. “It’s important for CareerTech and the state Department of Education to be aligned.” 
As for the other boards he’s assigned to as state superintendent, Fields said there are around 15 boards he’s part of. For those he’s statutorily required to sit on, Fields said he or a proxy will attend. Other boards will, in most cases, have an appointee attending. 
CareerTech is a state agency that provides K-12 and postsecondary students with skills, training and hands-on education throughout the state in their classrooms and technology centers.
Brent Haken, director of Oklahoma CareerTech, often led the board meetings in Walters’ absence. He said it’s “vital” to have Fields and staff from the Education Department at the meetings so the agencies are aligned.

“I can’t be successful unless he is being successful, and we really partner on a lot of programs,” he said. “So what it means to me is that we not only have partnerships, but we can collaborate and we can discuss what makes a difference in this state.” 
There’s been a “drastic” shift in attitudes and tone surrounding the partnership of the two state agencies since Fields’ appointment, Haken said. People are “excited” to be part of this transformation and are more engaged, he said. 
Brian Bobek, a new board member for Oklahoma CareerTech and state Board of Education, was sworn in by Haken on Thursday. He previously served on both boards and was re-appointed by Stitt Oct. 2 to replace Zachary Archer.

There are five zoos in the state accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums: Binder Park Zoo in Battle Creek, the Detroit Zoo in Royal Oak, John Ball Zoo in Grand Rapids, Potter Park Zoo in Lansing and Saginaw Children’s Zoo. This accreditation is centered on animal welfare, and of the 2,800 animal exhibitors licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture, less than 10% have received this accreditation. 
Michigan law currently bars accredited zoos from participating in breeding programs if they receive a critical citation from the USDA, even if the citation is for an issue unrelated to large carnivores, such as infrastructure or record keeping, Amanda Hanlin, chief of staff for the Detroit Zoological Society told to the committee. 
“This is really problematic because it can disrupt species survival plans that have been in place for decades and that are vital to supporting some of the most endangered large carnivores, including Amur tigers, polar bears, snow leopards and lions,” Hanlin said.

Hanlin pointed to an incident in Detroit last year where a raccoon had breached several layers of concrete and fencing to get into the zoo, where it attacked five mouse birds in an indoor aviary. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The zoo self-reported the incident to the USDA and received a critical citation. While the facilities team went into the habitat and performed extensive repairs, reinforced roof venting and installed trail cameras in order to ensure something similar would not happen again, there is not an option to have that citation removed despite taking corrective action, Hanlin said. 
“This is incredibly, incredibly significant for our zoo in particular, because we have two breeding licenses coming up in January that will expire, one for polar bears and one for lions,” Hanlin said. “So if we are not able to see this amendment through, then we would not be able to breed those animals beyond the time that those permits exist.” 
Andy McIntyre, the chief operating officer at John Ball Zoo detailed another incident in 2023, where a sitatunga – a species of antelope native to Africa – was killed when it was introduced to the zoo’s pygmy hippopotamus Jahari.

Pygmy hippos have been housed with animals of this type at 15 other institutions, McIntyre noted. While the two animals had been introduced to each other visually without issue, the hippopotamus attacked the sitatunga during their physical introduction, killing it. 
As a result the zoo received a critical non-compliance citation from the USDA. Despite taking steps to address the USDA’s concerns, McIntyre said the zoo will be unable to continue supporting science-based breeding efforts with Association of Zoos and Aquariums partners across the country when its breeding license for Amur tigers expires in December and its licensing for snow leopards expires in February. 
However, Rep. Matthew Bierlein’s (R-Vassar) House Bill 5092 would amend state law to clarify that a zoo remains eligible for a breeding license so long as its exhibitor’s license from the USDA has been in good standing for the previous five years, McIntyre explained, meaning the license has not been suspended or revoked and the license holder has not been subject to any cease and desist orders.
The update would also bring the state into alignment with federal policy eliminating “teachable moments” where certain issues that might not have previously triggered citations now do so, McIntyre said. 
“House Bill 5092 strengthens both animal welfare and conservation leadership. It keeps the original intent of a large carnivore act intact, protecting the public and stopping irresponsible ownership, while also removing unintended barriers for institutions that follow the law,” McIntyre said. 
The 13 committee members in attendance voted unanimously to refer the bill to the House floor for further consideration.

“This should be the kind of candidate that Democrats want in every state in the country,” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said talking about Zohran Mamdani during a town hall event with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on CNN.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., as they speak during a stop of their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour at Civic Center Park, March 21, 2025, in Denver. Photo by David Zalubowski/AP
This story by Torrie Herrington was first published by NOTUS on Oct. 15. It was produced as part of a partnership with NOTUS and the nonprofit, nonpartisan Allbritton Journalism Institute.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, pushed Democratic Party leadership to endorse New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani Wednesday night during a town hall event broadcast by CNN.
The pair of progressives even suggested that candidates in the same mold as Mamdani may be the antidote to the “doldrums” Democrats currently find themselves in.
“The guy is running an extraordinary campaign,” Sanders said. “He has something like 80,000 volunteers knocking on doors. He is bringing people out who never voted. He is bringing Blacks and whites and Latinos and Asians — everybody together around a really strong agenda talking about affordability in New York. What is not to like?”
“This should be the kind of candidate that Democrats want in every state in the country — strong grassroots campaigns, a willingness to take on the oligarchs and the big money interests and stand up for working class people,” he added.
Host Kaitlan Collins asked Sanders, “Are you speaking directly to [House Minority Leader] Hakeem Jeffries and [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer when you deliver that message?”
He responded, “Sure, I am. Hakeem, you watching this?”
NOTUS previously reported that Mamdani met with Schumer in September — and Jeffries earlier in the summer — but neither have issued a formal endorsement of the self-proclaimed democratic socialist.
When asked by Collins what she thought about Jeffries and Schumer’s decision to hold back from endorsing Mamdani, Ocasio-Cortez repeated her previous public statements that she believes it is crucial for the party to endorse its candidate once a primary has ended.
“Democrats have primaries for a reason,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “We may have our differences amongst one another within the party — some may be more conservative, some may be more liberal, or any other number of differences. That’s what we have primaries for. I believe in endorsing the nominee of the party after a primary has resolved itself.”
Ocasio-Cortez gave a related example: her decision to endorse former President Joe Biden after he won the Democratic primary in 2020.
“We all had to come together and do the work of supporting our party’s nominee in order to make sure that we win,” she said. “So I do worry about the example it sets when our leaders do not support the party nominee, because in the future, we will need folks to rally behind the presidential nominee.”
Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez spent the majority of the town hall discussing the ongoing government shutdown. During one particularly heated exchange, the pair called out their Republican colleagues for refusing to negotiate on measures that would end the standoff — namely, extensions to Affordable Care Act subsidies that would stave off massive increases in health insurance premiums.
Ocasio-Cortez said Republicans need to get to work, pointing out that House Republicans have been absent from Capitol Hill while House Speaker Mike Johnson keeps the chamber in an extended recess period.
“It is actually an unconscionable abdication and refusal to work,” she said. “I’ve never seen people who hate working so much in my life.”
She added, “Mike Johnson, you should be in that office negotiating with Hakeem Jeffries every damn day until we reopen this government, and any day that you don’t do that is a failure.”
Sanders echoed the sentiment, stating, “In the Senate, they need 60 votes. They don’t have 60 votes. They’ve got 53 or maybe 52 — that means you have to sit down and talk to the other side. It is not complicated. They are not doing that.”

Chellie Pingree at a launch event for her slow fashion caucus. (Provided by the office of U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree)U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree is seeking answers from the Trump administration’s top environmental official after reports that a long-delayed forever chemical risk assessment has been further postponed. 
The Democrat who represents Maine’s 1st Congressional District sent a letter to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Thursday asking him to explain why a toxicity assessment for a particular compound of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, hasn’t been released. 
Earlier this month, the nonprofit news organization ProPublica reported that scientists confirmed a report outlining the health detriments of perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was “completed and ready to post” in April but waiting on final briefings from leadership.
Citing Maine Morning Star reporting, Pingree presses EPA on PFAS grant terminations

The assessment found that PFNA can cause developmental, liver, and reproductive harm, including lower birth weights and reduced testosterone and sperm levels, according to ProPublica. 
In her letter to Zeldin, Pingree argued the delay is part of a “growing pattern of interference with the Agency’s scientific work.” She pointed specifically to a decision in May to rescind some regulations under the PFAS safe Drinking Water Act, including ones that pertain to PFNA. 
“We both know that PFAS poses a significant public health threat to our water, food supply, and farming communities. It is necessary to take steps to combat PFAS contamination, yet this delay and erosion of capacity directly contradict your repeated public statements about both transparency and the need for strong, science-based PFAS policies,” she continued.
Pingree, who is a ranking member of the House Appropriations Interior and Environment Subcommittee, asked Zeldin when he will commit to release the PFNA assessment and ensure that future reports are “free from political interference.”
Earlier this year, Pingree also pressed Zeldin on why the EPA cut almost $5 million in grants for forever chemical research in Maine. Shortly after, some of the grants were restored without explanation. 
And in July, Pingree worked with a Republican congressman from North Carolina to reintroduce the Healthy Drinking Water Affordability Act, which seeks to provide grants to individuals and nonprofits in rural communities to identify and address PFAS and other contaminants in drinking water.

(Photo by Rick Kern/Getty Images for National Council on Aging)The quality and cost of Medicare coverage depend on where you live, according to new research.
The Commonwealth Fund, a research nonprofit focused on health care, on Thursday released a report grading how well Medicare works for people in each state and the District of Columbia. The federally funded health insurance program covers about 68 million Americans who are at least 65 years old, and an additional 7 million with disabilities.
Medicare ostensibly provides the same coverage to all enrollees, but how individuals experience that coverage differs by state, researchers found.
“In some states, beneficiaries can see doctors quickly and afford their prescriptions,” Gretchen Johnson, vice president at the Commonwealth Fund, said in a statement. “In others, they face higher costs, delays or red tape.”
Vermont, Utah and Minnesota ranked at the top in the report’s rankings, while Louisiana, Mississippi and Kentucky landed at the bottom.
Researchers scored states based on 31 indicators, including demographic data like age and income, as well as factors including having a usual care provider, preventable hospital stays, and the share of beneficiaries with potentially dangerous medication prescriptions.
For example, the share of hospital admissions in West Virginia that could have been avoided with quality outpatient care was more than double the share in Idaho.
Costs vary, too. Because traditional Medicare does not cover prescription drugs, people on Medicare usually purchase separate drug plans or purchase drug coverage as part of a Medicare Advantage plan.
But those out-of-pocket costs differ depending on where a person lives. Older people in North Dakota pay nearly 13% of their drug costs out of pocket, compared with people in New York who pay less than 5%, the report found.
High-performing states such as Vermont and Utah tend to share certain characteristics. Most have Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans that offer better coverage than plans in other states. They’re also more likely to not require prior authorization for preventive services and specialty care.
Higher performing states also tend to have a health care system that performs well for people who aren’t covered by Medicare. States at the bottom of the rankings, such as Louisiana and Mississippi, have a much higher share of people who were uninsured or underinsured before they enrolled in Medicare.
“When people are sick coming into Medicare, they tend to be really sick when they’re on Medicare,” David Radley, a senior scientist at the Commonwealth Fund, told reporters on a press call earlier this week. “So if somebody is un- or underinsured before they age into Medicare, that might mean they have chronic diseases that may not necessarily be getting treated. They may be people that don’t get to see the doctor very often because they’re un- or underinsured.
“Then, when they age into Medicare, they can be much sicker on average than Medicare beneficiaries in other states.”

Roger Wicker. 
The measure passed the Senate 77-20, a rare bipartisan achievement in the chamber currently facing partisan gridlock and paralyzed by a government shutdown. The legislation is not final, but it sets Senate leaders up to begin negotiations with the House. 
Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi who leads the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement that the legislation will help modernize the military and strengthen national security. 
“My colleagues and I have prioritized reindustrialization and the structural rebuilding of the arsenal of democracy, starting with drone technology, shipbuilding, and innovative low-cost weapons,” Wicker said. “We have also set out to enact historic reforms in the Pentagon’s budgeting and acquisition process to unleash innovation and root out inefficiencies.”   
The bill will now go to a conference committee to reconcile differences between the Senate measure and the version the House passed in September.
U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, the junior Republican senator from Mississippi, also voted for the legislation. She said in a news release that the bill will help restore the strength of the country’s national defense. 
“The FY2026 NDAA builds on the down payment we made with the One Big Beautiful Bill by authorizing funding priorities and reforms,” Hyde-Smith said.  “I thank Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker for his leadership on this bill.”

Yazzie is one of the lead plaintiffs in an education court case that began over a decade ago. (Bella Davis/New Mexico In Depth)Indigenous education experts and advocates are outraged over the state’s draft action plan for improving education, which they say lacks detail and fails to meaningfully incorporate community input.
“We may be stuck with something that is unconscionable” if the Public Education Department doesn’t make changes before it submits the final plan to the court in early November, said Regis Pecos, a former governor of Cochiti Pueblo and co-director of the Leadership Institute at Santa Fe Indian School. “There has been a growing consensus that this is not what we need, and this is not what our children deserve.”
Pecos made those remarks Tuesday during a five-hour gathering attended by dozens of people just north of Albuquerque.

This story was originally published by New Mexico In Depth.

It’s been over seven years since a state judge in the landmark Yazzie/Martinez court case found New Mexico was violating its constitutional duty to provide a sufficient education to Native American and low-income students, English language learners, and students with disabilities.
The plaintiffs went back to court last fall, arguing the state wasn’t complying with the 2018 ruling. In April, another state judge agreed, setting an October deadline for PED to deliver a draft plan.
The 70-page document the agency crafted in response is “dismal,” said Melissa Candelaria (San Felipe Pueblo), education director at the New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty and attorney for the Yazzie plaintiffs. The draft, she said, is limited in concrete goals and funding estimates.
Navajo Nation Vice President Richelle Montoya and other tribal leaders in attendance told the crowd they will continue to advocate for Native students, in part by sharing the experts’ evaluations of the draft action plan with the Public Education Department. (Bella Davis/New Mexico In Depth)
It’s so vague that it’s “almost useless,” said Rep. Derrick Lente, a Democrat from Sandia Pueblo who’s considered a champion for tribal education.
Asked for a response to those criticisms, PED spokesperson Janelle Taylor García wrote, “We appreciate the engagement from education experts, tribal leaders, and community stakeholders during this critical period.”
Any feedback “will help shape the final version of the plan,” García said. The final plan is due Nov. 3, after which the plaintiffs will be able to file objections.
But some education experts and advocates are frustrated that, in their view, the department hasn’t fully integrated feedback it’s received for years, most recently at public meetings held around the state in August.
Tribal communities have long called on the state to carry out the 2003 Indian Education Act, which is meant to ensure students receive an education that connects to their cultures, in part through Native language instruction, following a not-so-distant history of violent attempts at assimilation.
“Where our children spend the greater amount of their time during the course of the day, during the course of the year, that’s where they should also see themselves, their languages, their cultures and their history,” Pecos said. “The survival of language and culture is truly at stake.”
Christine Sims (Acoma Pueblo), an associate professor in the University of New Mexico’s Department of Language, Literacy, and Sociocultural Studies, presented a number of gaps she identified in the draft.
For instance, one of the goals the draft sets is that every community will have access to high-quality programming that leads to literacy in English and a second language, including Native languages.
But the draft doesn’t spell out how schools will provide more Native language classes. It lists “tribal partners” as one of the parties responsible for helping to meet that goal of increased biliteracy, but it doesn’t factor in how districts and schools could collaborate with tribal nations to evaluate existing language programs and design new ones. The draft also doesn’t list specific instructional materials needed for language classes, Sims said, adding that teachers are often left to create such materials on their own.
Christine Sims talks about her analysis of what the Yazzie/Martinez draft action plan says about Native languages. “My initial reaction was disappointment, because it just seemed to be a listing of ideas that had no link to one another,” Sims said. (Bella Davis/New Mexico In Depth)
And aside from one mention of Jicarilla Apache students, the draft does not name the eight Native languages spoken by the 23 federally recognized tribes in New Mexico, nor does it mention tribes by name.
That’s a problem, Sims said, because identifying those languages is the first step in assessing the programs schools offer and what’s needed.
During a presentation focused on well-being and behavioral supports, Chenoa Bah Stilwell-Jensen (Diné), a UNM instructor focused on health education, said a man in Farmington she spoke with was troubled that he and his wife were not contacted about the individualized education program for the grandson they’re raising, who has autism.
Some Taos families have similar concerns, said Glenabah Martinez (Taos Pueblo/Diné), director of the Institute for American Indian Education at UNM. She questions what the state plans to do to make sure special education is culturally relevant.
The draft doesn’t meet nine key components the Yazzie legal team outlined earlier this year, Martinez said. Those components — including developing robust accountability mechanisms — “push the boundaries of what we should do in terms of curriculum, instruction, assessment, policy,” Martinez said.
“We’re this many years in, and we’re still fighting for our children,” plaintiff Wilhelmina Yazzie (Diné) said. “Coming to you as a mother, it’s heartbreaking to see.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/photo1-1024x683.png,,,2025-10-16 14:03:19.432967

Andy Barr continues to hold a big fundraising lead in the hotly-contested primary battle among three top Republicans hoping to succeed longtime U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell.
Andy Barr for Senate reports having nearly $6.7 million on hand at the beginning of the month, compared to $630,000 on hand for former Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s campaign fund, according to recent filings with the Federal Election Commission.
Entrepreneur Nate Morris’ campaign reported having a bit over $1 million on hand, while three-fourths of the money taken in by Morris’ campaign came in a $3 million personal loan from Morris.
While Barr has raised more money from individuals than his two rivals, reports reflect his big money lead is largely the result of the experience and connections he’s gained during 16 years representing Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District.
The foundation of his war chest is nearly $3.7 million he transferred from his old Andy Barr for Congress committee early this year when he announced he would run for U.S. Senate in 2026. Also, FEC reports show that Barr’s Senate campaign has raised more than $1.2 million from traditional political action committees, most of them based in Washington. 
Morris has reported just $30,000 in contributions from political action committees (PAC)  and Cameron just $1,000.
Meanwhile, any analysis of the money affecting this race must also consider the millions of dollars that are already being spent (with much more to come) by super PACs to support or attack the candidates.
Money isn’t everything
Stephen Voss, associate professor of political science at the University of Kentucky, cautioned against exaggerating the importance of money in this campaign ahead of the May primary. “Nate Morris and Andy Barr have spent a lot already,” but Cameron still has a solid lead in the polls due to his high name recognition statewide due to his successful race for attorney general in 2019 and his unsuccessful campaign for governor in 2023,” Voss said.
Stephen Voss
Cameron’s high name recognition, combined with a sufficient amount of money he will raise, makes him a viable candidate, Voss said. And Voss said Barr is viable because he has a brimming war chest to spread his name and message to Republican voters outside his congressional district.
Morris is more reliant on what all three candidates are desperately seeking, an endorsement from Republican President Donald Trump, Voss said.
“More important than all of the money is what Donald Trump decides,” Voss said.
Barr campaign spokesman Alex Bellizzi released a statement Monday that said in part, “Andy Barr is the only candidate to have won tough races and helped President Trump implement the America First agenda. Now Andy Barr is also the only candidate with the resources, grassroots support and momentum to put this Senate race away for Republicans.”
The Cameron campaign released a statement that read in part, “The real question is — do these other guys have enough to catch Daniel. He’s up 20 points in poll after poll … Voters matter most — and voters LOVE Daniel Cameron.”
Kentucky Lantern was unable to contact the Morris campaign.
Here’s a look at what reports filed this week with the FEC show:
Andy Barr for Senate Inc.
Barr started the recent quarter on July 1 with $6.1 million on hand. During the quarter he raised just over $1.8 million; of that $1.2 million came from individuals, $127,000 from traditional PACs, and about $450,000 in transfers from people and PACs who previously gave to a different Barr political committee.
Barr reported spending more than $1.2 million during the quarter. And on Oct. 1 his campaign reported having $6,686,700 on hand.
Cameron for Senate Inc.
Cameron began the quarter with about $532,000. During the quarter he raised $411,200 from individuals. His campaign spent more than $313,000 during the quarter. The campaign reported having $629,700 on hand at the start of this month.
Morris for Senate
Morris officially launched his campaign around July 1 and the report it filed this week is the first it has filed with the FEC. It shows Morris got nearly $1 million in contributions ($30,000 from PACs and the rest from people) during the quarter. Also, Morris loaned his campaign fund $3,027,000. As of Oct. 1, the report shows the Morris campaign has $1,070,400 on hand, but a debt of $3,027,000 owed to Morris.
Democrats
 

	As for the Democrats running in next May’s primary for U.S. Senate, Joel Willett, an Army veteran and former CIA officer, has the fundraising lead. Willett, who opened his campaign in September, reported raising $119,800, and he loaned his campaign $200,000. As of Oct. 1 his campaign reported having $315,200 on hand.
State Sen. Pamela Stevenson, of Louisville, who launched her campaign early this year, reported raising $41,600 and spending $65,400 during the recent quarter. Because she had cash on hand at the beginning of the quarter she was able to report a campaign balance of $24,900 as of Oct. 1.
Logan Forsythe, a lawyer and former Secret Service agent who started his campaign in September, reported raising $39,800 and spending $1,400, leaving a balance of $38,400 at the beginning of this month.
Amy McGrath, the former Navy pilot who has lost prior campaigns for the U.S. House and Senate, did not open her current campaign for the Senate until earlier this month and will not have to report any campaign finances until January.

Those taken by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, included the parents of children who were in school at the time of the raid, Hamden Mayor Lauren Garrett said.
“Their children are in school,” Garrett said at an afternoon press conference. “We don’t know which community. We don’t know how to contact that school. We are still trying to find out how to get in touch with this family so that their kids don’t go to an empty house when they get off of school.”
ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the raid.
“The actions from the administration and ICE are deplorable, they are disgusting, they are not what we represent in Hamden,” Garrett said. “We are here today to stand up for the people of Hamden, for the families that are living in fear because of an inhumane presidency.”
A witness at the press conference, who gave only the first name Rachel, said she saw masked agents in unmarked vehicles making arrests at the car wash.
Rachel said she asked one detained man on the ground if he was okay, at which point an agent threatened her with arrest.
“I told him that he did not have the right to speak to me that way and that I was an American citizen,” Rachel said.
U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, who represents the area in Congress, said in a statement that she was working to confirm the “safety and status” of those taken.
“The aggressive tactics used by ICE and endorsed by President Trump have escalated tensions with communities here and across the country, exacerbating fear,” DeLauro said. “They are not making Americans any safer.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25161836500390-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-16 14:03:19.432967

(Getty Images)Five in six Indiana parents who want an after-school program for their child can’t find one — largely because of cost, transportation and a lack of available options — according to new survey data from the Afterschool Alliance.
The “America After 3PM” household survey, released Wednesday, found that just 83,820 Hoosier children are enrolled in an after-school program even though parents of nearly half a million kids would like to be.
After-school programs range from academic tutoring and STEM clubs to sports, arts and mentoring activities that give students a “safe, structured” place to spend time after the school day ends.
“Right now, 411,972 Hoosier children whose families want them in afterschool programs don’t have access,” said Lakshmi Hasanadka, CEO of the Indiana Afterschool Network. “Afterschool programs keep kids safe, help them learn, and support working families. We’ll continue working with partners statewide to remove barriers until every student who needs an afterschool program can be in one.”
Story continues below.
IN-AA3PM-2025-Fact-Sheet
 
Nearly all Indiana parents whose children are enrolled in after-school programs rate them highly, with 91% calling their programs excellent or very good, according to the survey. But 53% of parents whose children aren’t enrolled said cost was a barrier, and nearly half cited transportation or inconvenient locations.
On average, Indiana children spend 5.8 hours per week in after-school programs, which cost families about $76.90 per week, according to the Afterschool Alliance’s state fact sheet.
The survey, conducted by Edge Research, included responses from 675 Indiana parents and is the first of its kind since the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Afterschool Alliance. 
“Parents recognize that programs in Indiana are doing outstanding work,” said Jodi Grant, the nonprofit’s executive director, in a statement. “Every child deserves access to a quality afterschool program but sadly, this study shows we’re far from reaching that goal. We need greater support from federal, state, and local governments, businesses, and philanthropy to change that.”
The Trump administration withheld more than $1 billion in federal funding for after-school programming earlier this summer, leaving states and programs scrambling to fill in the gaps. Grants have since been released, but future after-school dollars remain in question, Grant said.
Indiana-specific data published by the alliance shows 84% of Hoosier parents said after-school programs give them peace of mind, and 83% said such programs help them keep their jobs or work more hours.
Indiana parents also overwhelmingly support more public funding, with 89% in favor, according to the Afterschool Alliance.
The survey also found that after-school participation gaps persist across income levels. Families with lower and middle incomes were significantly more likely to say they lack access to programs, mirroring national trends.

The Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority spearheads restoration projects to build land, storm resilience and habitat along Louisiana’s sinking coast. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)THIBODAUX – Members of the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority want to know why their chairman decided to cancel another land-building sediment diversion project without first running the idea by them.    
At Wednesday’s CPRA meeting, chairman Gordy Dove defended his decision to cancel the Mid-Breton Sediment Diversion project without first consulting the board. The project would have channeled fresh water and sediment from the Mississippi River in upper Plaquemines parish to the dying coastal marshes of Breton Sound.   
Dove, an appointee of Gov. Jeff Landry, doubled down on the estimated $1.8 billion cost of the Mid-Breton project as the reason for pulling its permits, saying he wouldn’t bring anything not “fiscally responsible” before the board. The governor has supported the move away from major sediment diversion undertakings, including the end of the far larger $3 billion Mid-Barataria project despite $560 million having already been spent on it.   
“No use to keep bleeding on something you’re not gonna build, you don’t have the money to build,” said Dove. “At some point, you’ve got to have an adding machine.”
CPRA member Jerome “Zee” Zeringue, a Republican state lawmaker from Houma, complained there was no public discussion with the board before Dove ended the project. He also questioned whether reasons other than cost were behind its cancelation. 
Dwayne Bourgeois, who represents the Terrebonne Basin on the CPRA board, joined Zeringue in asking whether other portions of Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan should be reevaluated based on Mid-Breton’s cancelation. The long-term, $50 billion blueprint to protect and rebuild the state’s fragile coastline has been in motion since 2007. 
“In terms of the master plan, these were two of the major ones,” Zeringue said, speaking on the Mid-Breton and Mid-Barataria sediment diversion projects.  “How are we going to address the interaction with the other projects?
Bourgeois asked CPRA executive director Michael Hare to see if the latest diversion project cancelation would impact any other projects.
Charles Sutcliffe, resilience adviser with the National Wildlife Federation, said the Mid-Breton project’s cancellation without consulting the board and a lack of communication around funding updates is concerning for coastal restoration efforts as well as maintaining public trust. 
“This is a public body doing the work of the public. It’s supposed to happen in plain view,” Sutcliffe said. “I’m worried about their commitment to transparency and commitment to following the master plan.”
The canceled sediment diversions were each expected to divert around 75,000 cubic feet per second of Mississippi River water into Breton Sound and Barataria Bay to rebuild degrading wetland habitat. Mid-Breton had not yet entered the construction phase, while work had already begun on Mid-Barataria when the project was canceled. 
Initial price estimates for the Mid-Breton Sediment Diversion rose from around $800 million dollars to $1.8 billion, Dove said at the CPRA meeting without offering details on the reason for the increase. He did not respond to attempts to reach him after the meeting.
Funding for Mid-Breton, in part, was expected to come from the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement. The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation also pledged $90 million in 2016 for the project’s engineering and design. 
Dove implied full funding would be needed for Louisiana to move forward with major coastal restoration projects. Zeringue countered the idea, saying, “We go forward on projects we don’t have all the money for in other cases.”
“Not anymore,” Dove said.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9544-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-16 12:58:36.917945

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star)A group of lawmakers, lobbyists, advocates and interested members of the public made a pilgrimage to three of Maine’s waste facilities Wednesday to see for themselves how the state is handling the roughly 1.8 million tons of waste generated each year.
Maine Sen. Denise Tepler (D-Sagadahoc) said the tour was intended to give members of the Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee, which she co-chairs, a chance to better understand the facilities that their work helps govern. Waste is a pressing environmental issue in the state right now, evidenced by the upwards of 40 people that joined the tours. 
The day started at Municipal WasteHub in Hampden, a recycling facility that is in the process of installing an anaerobic digester to process organic waste, such as animal manure, food waste and sewage sludge. The next stop was Eagle Point Energy Center in Orrington, which is a waste-to-energy facility that can use solid waste to generate up to 25 megawatts of electricity. Since it came under new ownership last year, Eagle Point is still in the process of bringing operations back to full capacity.

With sweeping views of surrounding Penobscot County and even Mount Katahdin to the north, the tour climbed to the very top of the state-owned Juniper Ridge Landfill in Old Town for its final stop. A steady stream of trucks came into Cell 16, a plot of land where trash is actively being landfilled, while excavators and bulldozers prepared adjacent land to be the next active cell. 
Just over half of Maine’s landfill waste ends up in Juniper Ridge, which is expected to reach capacity in 2028. The state has signaled its support for expanding the facility despite objections from environmental advocates, the local community and the Penobscot Nation.
Rep. Dan Ankeles (D-Brunswick), a committee member, said the tours helped paint a better picture of waste processes in the state. He pointed out that all three facilities have plans to expand their capacity, but said the information he learned Wednesday showed that Maine’s trash challenges are about more than just filling up a landfill. 
“It’s not just about landfill capacity,” Ankeles said. “There’s a lot going on at once and this is a jigsaw puzzle with a lot of pieces and some of the pieces are changing shape.”
In particular, Ankeles, who sponsored a suite of legislation earlier this year in response to a spill of toxic forever chemicals in his community, was left thinking about the downstream effects of the water that goes from these waste facilities into wastewater treatment plants.
At Juniper Ridge, employees explained how the leachate, or the water that seeps through the waste and can pick up contaminants along the way, is transported to wastewater treatment plants that ultimately discharge it back into waterways.

Sewage sludge, which is known to be contaminated with per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS, is mixed with the trash at Juniper Ridge — a process that Wednesday’s tour group was able to see up close when a bulldozer mixed a full dump-truck load of sludge into truckloads of trash. 
In addition to the challenges surrounding solid waste capacity, Ankeles said Maine’s current waste processes leave the state “in freefall when it comes to letting PFAS go into our water bodies.” 
PFAS have been tied to myriad health concerns, including elevated incidences of certain cancers and other illnesses.
Environmental groups, local residents and the Penobscot Nation, whose reservation sits downstream from the landfill, have raised concerns about insufficient treatment of leachate as the state considers allowing the landfill to expand operations to the north. The Maine Department of Environmental Protection has required the landfill operator, Casella, to install an  approved system for treating landfill leachate for PFAS before it could expand operations. 
Without action, Old Town residents worry town will be ‘sacrifice zone’ to Juniper Ridge

The tour included a look at where Casella plans to install that system. 
At the close of the tour, Ankeles said he was thinking about what his committee could do to address these challenges. While bills for the upcoming legislative session in January aren’t finalized yet, Tepler put in a request that seeks to install a sludge dryer at Juniper Ridge, which would decrease sludge volume and weight.
During the tour, a Casella employee said reducing wet waste could help decrease the need for additional bulky waste to be brought in to stabilize the trash mixture. However, there were questions raised about whether sludge could rehydrate.
That issue became a flashpoint last session due to a proposal — that was eventually signed into law — to allow even more out-of-state waste to be brought to Maine. 
During the debate on the bill, Tepler said she’s “not convinced the operator of the landfill is an honest broker,” but warned that without the ability to bring in more bulky waste to stabilize the sludge it could mean “serious problems at the landfill.”

The Indianola private university announced this week it has joined the consortium, a NASA-affiliated organization committed to supporting education, research and outreach in STEM and other areas aligned with NASA interests.
“This is incredibly exciting news,” said Aswati Subramanian, Simpson associate professor of biology, in a news release. “Simpson students and faculty across disciplines now have access to funding opportunities for research projects, as well as resources to develop curricula that support the development of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) skills, with a focus on improving student outcomes.”

Consortium members, both students and faculty, have the chance to apply for different grants, scholarships and fellowships through the consortium, as well as internships at NASA centers and more. Affiliates of the consortium include Iowa State University, the University of Iowa, the University of Northern Iowa, Drake University, Des Moines Area Community College, Loras College and Morningside University.
Iowa Space Grant Consortium Director Sara Nelson visited the Simpson campus before the college was made a partner, the release stated, where Subramanian showed her lab areas and spoke about her work on space biology and a project for which she’s mentoring two students. Subramanian said in the release other faculty members and students are already interested in pursuing funds for their own research.
Brennan Voss and Brian Rollison, both set to graduate in 2027, are working with Subramanian and researching how “simulated micro gravity and hyper gravity” impact single-cell organisms. Voss said in the release he never expected to be able to conduct this kind of work at Simpson and he has “enjoyed the problem-solving that comes with stepping outside my comfort zone to explore new areas of science.”
“I had very little research experience before this, so this project is providing great insight,” Rollison said in the release. “Getting accepted into the Iowa NASA Space Grants Consortium is awesome because it not only opens the door for Brennan and me, but also for many students in the future.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Des Moines School Board President Jackie Norris ended her campaign for U.S. Senate Thursday, saying she plans to focus on efforts to investigate and bring accountability to Des Moines Public Schools following the immigration arrest of former Superintendent Ian Roberts.
Norris had entered the race in August as a Democratic candidate, focusing her campaign on supporting public education and aid programs cut by recent GOP-backed laws like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP. In a Democratic primary field that had some candidates getting more national or state attention, such as state Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, and Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs, as well as former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce Director Nathan Sage, Norris’ campaign had a lower profile than some of her competitors.
But in the two months since her announcement, the Des Moines School Board has become a focal point in state and national politics. In late September, Roberts, who served as DMPS superintendent since 2023, was arrested and detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Federal officials have since confirmed Roberts, a citizen of Guyana, was given an order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024.

Multiple reports had also found Roberts had falsified parts of his education credentials and resume during the DMPS hiring process. The background check process conducted during this process also did not reveal some of Roberts’ previous criminal charges or immigration status — issues which led to the school board moving to sue the search firm it used in hiring Roberts,  JG Consulting.
Norris said in a statement Thursday the Roberts situation has “demanded my full attention as Board Chair and, overnight, put the School Board, our community, and me personally in the crosshairs of vicious and coordinated attacks, …” and taken away her time and capacity to advocate for Iowans as a U.S. Senate candidate in the way she aimed to achieve.
“As Chair of the School Board, we stepped up and are bringing accountability — leading with grace, transparency, and resolve,” Norris said in a statement. “To that end, it’s clear I need to focus on the work at hand: leading the board through this transition, working to support the passage of the Reimagining Education bond, and fully participating in ongoing investigations to get the answers our community deserves.”
Republicans have attacked Norris for approving Roberts as superintendent, and for her fundraising efforts as the situation unfolded.
“As chair of the Des Moines School Board, Iowa Democrat Senate candidate Jackie Norris hired an illegal alien with a rap sheet to be her Superintendent and work with children,” National Republican Senatorial Committee Regional Press Secretary Samantha Cantrell said in a September statement. “Jackie Norris has put every single Des Moines student and family in danger. Democrats will stop at nothing to protect criminal illegal aliens.”
U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson is the frontrunner to become the Republican nominee for Iowa’s U.S. Senate seat in 2026. She entered the race after U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst announced she would not run for reelection.
In addition to responding to the Roberts situation, Norris said she is advocating for the $265 million general obligation bond that will go before voters in the school district in the Nov. 4 election. The bond would cover the construction costs of the “Reimagining Education, Reinvigorating Schools” initiative, a five-year plan aiming at expanding all-day, 4-year-old preschool, creating more hands-on and technical programs for students and improving academic outcomes. The money approved through the bond would be paid back over 20 years through property taxes.
The school board and DMPS leaders announced Tuesday the creation of an independent, third-party oversight committee for the bond project, which would provide financial oversight and review of the initiative if the language is approved by voters.
Norris thanked Iowans who supported her Senate campaign in her announcement.
“I will keep fighting for a better politics,” Norris said. “I believe people will trust government again when politicians put people over a party label and get things done. I leave this race with my head high, and I’ll continue serving my community and doing everything I can to help Democrats win this seat.”

TOPEKA — El presidente y el vicepresidente de los Kansas Young Republicans (Jóvenes Republicanos de Kansas), participaron en chats encriptados con sus compañeros políticos que estaban plagados de retórica violenta, racista y antisemita, y se mezclaron con referencias a la supremacía blanca y la supresión de los archivos de Jeffrey Epstein.
El martes, el presidente del Partido Republicano de Kansas dijo que el artículo de Politico que reveló el comentario provocó la desactivación inmediata de la organización Kansas Young Republicans.
Politico, una empresa de noticias digitales especializada en la cobertura de la política estadounidense, informó que el presidente de los Kansas Young Republicans, Alex Dwyer, y el vicepresidente William Hendrix participaron en el chat grupal en Telegram.
En 2900 páginas de texto del chat, Hendrix elogió a los Missouri Young Republicans porque a los líderes de ese estado no les gustaba la comunidad LGBTQ+. Usó repetidamente insultos raciales para referirse a las personas negras, incluyendo palabras como “n-ga” y “n-guh”. En una conversación de julio en el hilo sobre afroamericanos, decía: “Mi colega está en un restaurante de pollo pidiendo su comida. ¿Le gustaría un poco de sandía y Kool-Aid para acompañar eso?”.
Él fue despedido de un trabajo de comunicaciones en la oficina del Fiscal General Kris Kobach mientras Politico preparaba su informe sobre el papel de Hendrix en el chat.
“Los comentarios en el chat son inexcusables”, dijo Kobach. “En cuanto la oficina se enteró de esos mensajes, despidieron a Will Hendrix”.
En los hilos de chat, Dwyer y otros profundizaron en debates sobre cómo los agentes republicanos podrían manchar la imagen de un candidato político al vincularlo con supremacistas blancos. La idea fue descartada, según Politico, porque el plan podría ser contraproducente en un lugar como Kansas, donde “los jóvenes republicanos podrían sentirse atraídos por ese oponente”. Posteriormente, una persona en el chat pidió a otros que adivinaran el número de habitación de un hotel.
Dwyer respondió: “1488”. Ese número es una forma abreviada entre los supremacistas blancos para referirse a sus creencias. Se refiere a las 14 palabras del lema: “Debemos asegurar la existencia de nuestro pueblo y un futuro para los niños blancos”. El “88” significa “Heil Hitler”, y la H marca la octava letra del alfabeto.
En otro momento, Dwyer abordó la controversia relacionada con la divulgación de archivos gubernamentales sobre Epstein, el delincuente sexual convicto. Republicanos y demócratas en el Congreso han solicitado la divulgación pública de archivos para exonerar o incriminar al presidente Donald Trump o a otras personalidades prominentes.
“Trump está demasiado ocupado quemando los archivos de Epstein”, escribió Dwyer en Telegram.

TOPEKA — El presidente y el vicepresidente de los Kansas Young Republicans (Jóvenes Republicanos de Kansas), participaron en chats encriptados con sus compañeros políticos que estaban plagados de retórica violenta, racista y antisemita, y se mezclaron con referencias a la supremacía blanca y la supresión de los archivos de Jeffrey Epstein.
El martes, el presidente del Partido Republicano de Kansas dijo que el artículo de Politico que reveló el comentario provocó la desactivación inmediata de la organización Kansas Young Republicans.
Politico, una empresa de noticias digitales especializada en la cobertura de la política estadounidense, informó que el presidente de los Kansas Young Republicans, Alex Dwyer, y el vicepresidente William Hendrix participaron en el chat grupal en Telegram.
En 2900 páginas de texto del chat, Hendrix elogió a los Missouri Young Republicans porque a los líderes de ese estado no les gustaba la comunidad LGBTQ+. Usó repetidamente insultos raciales para referirse a las personas negras, incluyendo palabras como “n-ga” y “n-guh”. En una conversación de julio en el hilo sobre afroamericanos, decía: “Mi colega está en un restaurante de pollo pidiendo su comida. ¿Le gustaría un poco de sandía y Kool-Aid para acompañar eso?”.
Él fue despedido de un trabajo de comunicaciones en la oficina del Fiscal General Kris Kobach mientras Politico preparaba su informe sobre el papel de Hendrix en el chat.
“Los comentarios en el chat son inexcusables”, dijo Kobach. “En cuanto la oficina se enteró de esos mensajes, despidieron a Will Hendrix”.
En los hilos de chat, Dwyer y otros profundizaron en debates sobre cómo los agentes republicanos podrían manchar la imagen de un candidato político al vincularlo con supremacistas blancos. La idea fue descartada, según Politico, porque el plan podría ser contraproducente en un lugar como Kansas, donde “los jóvenes republicanos podrían sentirse atraídos por ese oponente”. Posteriormente, una persona en el chat pidió a otros que adivinaran el número de habitación de un hotel.
Dwyer respondió: “1488”. Ese número es una forma abreviada entre los supremacistas blancos para referirse a sus creencias. Se refiere a las 14 palabras del lema: “Debemos asegurar la existencia de nuestro pueblo y un futuro para los niños blancos”. El “88” significa “Heil Hitler”, y la H marca la octava letra del alfabeto.
En otro momento, Dwyer abordó la controversia relacionada con la divulgación de archivos gubernamentales sobre Epstein, el delincuente sexual convicto. Republicanos y demócratas en el Congreso han solicitado la divulgación pública de archivos para exonerar o incriminar al presidente Donald Trump o a otras personalidades prominentes.
“Trump está demasiado ocupado quemando los archivos de Epstein”, escribió Dwyer en Telegram.
Dwyer no respondió a una solicitud de entrevista. Hendrix, quien se postuló sin éxito para el Concejo Municipal de Topeka en 2021, no pudo ser contactado para obtener comentarios.

An outbreak of shootings occurred last weekend within a 24-hour period across the state, including at two historically Black universities, Alcorn State in Lorman and Jackson State at Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium. 
On Saturday night, a 29-year-old Vicksburg woman died and two others were wounded after a shooting near a building at Alcorn State’s campus. The university said Fisher was not a student. 
On the same night, a child was shot in the abdomen near the tailgating area outside Jackson State’s stadium and was taken to the hospital. One suspect was arrested in connection to the Alcorn State shooting, Mississippi Bureau of Investigation on Oct. 15. 
As a result, Mississippi Valley State University, another HBCU, announced it is beefing up its campus public safety presence this weekend by partnering with local, state and county law enforcement authorities. 
This includes a “series of proactive safety protocols,” like curfews for tailgating, vehicle inspections at all campus entry points and campus access restrictions with Valley State students being required to show valid ID. The university says it will step up enforcement of its ban on firearms. 
“The safety and well-being of our students, alumni, and guests remain our highest priority. We look forward to a weekend filled with school spirit, fellowship, and celebration — made even stronger by our shared commitment to keeping The Valley Safe,” a statement from the university said. “MVSU encourages all attendees to remain vigilant, respect the established guidelines, and contribute to a positive and secure Homecoming experience.”

Delta State, another public university in the area, said it will be enforcing a clear-bag policy at all events. 
The university said it has also moved its Homecoming Green Glow, a Friday student event, from outside to Kent Wyatt Hall Atrium inside to ensure safety. Additionally, tailgating events for Friday evening have been canceled. Kickoff is at 1 p.m. Saturday, and other tailgating events will end one hour after the end of the game. 
Homecoming is this Saturday at the University of Southern Mississippi and Oct. 25 at Mississippi State University. Officials at those schools also said they are taking precautions as they anticipate thousands of students, alumni and others to participate in festivities. 
As a former MVSU police chief, state Rep. Robert L. Sanders said he is saddened to hear about the shootings. The Democratic lawmaker from Cleveland said he anticipates,  as the next legislative session approaches, the House Universities and Colleges Committee will look at ways to enhance campus safety for all higher education institutions across the state. 
“We had a bad situation happen this past weekend, but this now gives us something to discuss and work toward,” said Sanders, a 1984 MVSU alum who serves on that committee. 
Senate Minority Leader Derrick Simmons, whose Delta district includes Leland, called the carnage in that city on Friday night, “senseless gun violence.” Six people were killed and multiple others wounded during a celebration downtown in what is the deadliest shooting in the country this year. 
Simmons, a Greenville Democrat, released a statement commending Valley State for its proactive measures and calling for a statewide commitment to safety as well as funding to achieve these efforts. 
“Students, alumni, families, faculty and staff look forward to homecoming,” Simmons, a Valley State alum, told Mississippi Today this week. “We don’t want the risk of violence to affect that spirit because we want to reconnect and honor our traditions of our respective schools.” 
While the shooting in Leland was at a block party, not tailgating, the Mississippi High School Activities Association is urging schools to stop on-campus tailgating in the wake of the shootings across the state, including Heidelberg and Sharkey County.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02152225/3X0A0789.jpg,,,2025-10-16 12:04:40.336283

It’s called prison gerrymandering, and the study from the Prison Policy Initiative says that four state House districts in Florida illustrate how the decennial U.S. Census Bureau’s policy of counting prisoners where they are incarcerated instead of where they hail from distorts the process and gives some residents a louder voice in government.
The issue is not new to Florida counties with prison populations.
In 2015, the ACLU of Florida filed a lawsuit challenging district maps for county commission and school board elections in Jefferson County in North Florida, alleging the incarcerated population made up more than 42% of the voting age population in one district. A federal judge ruled in 2016 that the five county commission districts violated the constitutional principle of “one person, one vote.”
In the aftermath of that decision, six North Florida counties and two North Florida school districts avoided prison gerrymandering when drawing up their local districts after the 2020 U.S. Census, according to the institute. The report says that seven Florida counties and three school districts avoided prison-based gerrymandering after the 2010 Census.
At least 15 states have passed laws or adopted guidance modifying how incarcerated persons are counted and allocated during the redistricting process, according to a 2024 report from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Florida House Democrats raised the issue during the 2021 legislative hearings regarding congressional and legislative redistricting in the state. The complaint didn’t move GOP lawmakers who were in charge of the process.
The four districts listed in the report are in mostly rural areas :
House District 7, which encompasses Gulf, Liberty, Franklin, Wakulla, Taylor, Dixie, Lafayette, Suwannee, Hamilton, and parts of Leon and Jefferson counties. The report says 10% of the district’s population is made up of the incarcerated.
House District 10, which includes Columbia, Baker, Union, Bradford, and part of Alachua counties. The report says 8% of the district’s population is made up of the incarcerated.
House District 5, which includes Walton, Holmes, Washington, Jackson, and Calhoun counties. The report says that 7% of the district consists of incarcerated individuals.
House District 52, which includes Sumter and parts of Hernando counties, where the report says that 5% of the district’s population is incarcerated. The largest prison facility in the district is Federal Corrections Complex Coleman, the largest federal prison complex in the nation, with inmates from all across the country.
The report says that only about 6% of the population at the Coleman Complex comes from Florida, “which means out of the 6,285 people held by the Bureau of Prisons at FCC Coleman, only about 371 people are likely Florida residents.” The report adds that most of those 371 people aren’t likely to be actual residents of House District 52.

Secretary of State Denny Hoskins announced Wednesday that roughly 100,000 signatures gathered so far for the referendum won’t count — and that gathering them before his office approved “constitutes a misdemeanor election offense.”
Later in the day, Attorney General Catherine Hanaway filed a lawsuit arguing that holding a referendum on the congressional map is unconstitutional and asking a federal judge to stop it. 
“Missouri politicians continue to try to confuse, intimidate and, frankly, silence us,” Richard Von Glahn of People Not Politicians, the committee behind the referendum campaign, told reporters Thursday. 
People Not Politicians is already in court challenging Hoskins’ decision to reject its initial referendum petitions because they were filed in September before the governor signed the redistricting bill.  If those petitions aren’t valid, neither are the 100,000 signatures already gathered for the referendum. 
Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green set the case for a trial on Nov. 4. 
“This office remains committed to transparency, accuracy and protecting Missouri voters’ trust in the democratic process,” Hoskins said Wednesday. 
At the heart of the debate is Missouri’s congressional map, which has eight districts with six currently represented by Republicans. 
Missouri lawmakers pass gerrymandered congressional map, initiative petition limits

Lawmakers returned to the Capitol last month to gerrymander one of the Democratic seats in a way that would adhere to President Donal Trump’s instructions to create a new GOP district before the 2026 midterms.
The target was the 5th District, based in Kansas City and represented by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver since 2005. It is carved up under the new map with portions attached to the 4th and 6th Districts. Heavily Republican areas stretching along the Missouri River to Boone County were added to the remaining Kansas City portions.
Hours after the map won legislative approval, People Not Politicians filed for a referendum to put it on the ballot. Under the Missouri Constitution, if the group gathers 106,000 signatures before Dec. 11, the map will not go into effect until after a statewide vote. 
The referendum poses a real threat to the new map. Of the 27 times a referendum has been placed on the Missouri ballot, voters have rejected actions by the General Assembly all but twice. That includes 1922, when voters rejected a new congressional map drawn by the legislature. 
A referendum was last deployed in Missouri seven years ago, when labor unions collected 300,000 signatures in 90 days to put a question on the statewide ballot repealing a GOP-backed right-to-work law.
A year later, the secretary of state’s office used procedural maneuvers to derail a referendum campaign that sought to overturn newly-passed restrictions on abortion. 
That 2019 referendum never got off the ground because of the secretary of state’s actions. But it sparked a 2022 Missouri Supreme Court ruling that determined the laws the secretary of state used to obstruct the citizen-initiated referendum process were unconstitutional.
“We’ve been here before,” said Chuck Hatfield, an attorney representing People Not Politicians. “The Secretary of State knows better.”
People Not Politicians has raised $2.6 million in six-figure donations since the campaign began last month. According to disclosure reports filed with the state ethics commission, more than $1.2 million of that has gone directly towards signature gathering. 
Most of the group’s money has come from out-of-state nonprofits who are not obligated to disclose their donors. Last week, Kansas City-based Health Forward Foundation donated $750,000. 
Hanaway pointed to People Not Politicians out-of-state donors in announcing her federal lawsuit seeking to block the referendum.  
“Missouri’s redistricting process cannot be dictated by out-of-state special interests,” Hanaway said. “We will not allow dark money groups to silence Missouri voices or hijack the work of the General Assembly.”
Hatfield called the actions of Hanaway and Hoskins “outrageous” and a “full on tantrum about the right of the people to overrule these congressional districts, which is a right the people are guaranteed in the constitution.”
In particular, he called the accusation that gathering signatures could ever be considered a crime “totally ridiculous.”
“This is nothing,” Hatfield said, “but an attempt to intimidate and deny people the right to petition their government.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_rally3-1024x615.jpg,,,2025-10-16 12:04:40.336283

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from campaign video)TOPEKA — Former financial services executive Sandy Spidel Neumann announced Thursday her candidacy for the Democratic Party’s nomination to the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Roger Marshall.
Spidel Neumann said she opposed Marshall-endorsed tariffs that are harmful to farmers and Medicaid cuts that threaten rural hospitals. She said she was motivated to seek office in the wake of Marshall’s decision to walk out on a combative, contentious crowd during a March town hall he was hosting in Oakley.
“When I saw Marshall walk out, I knew I had to step up,” she said. “I’m running for Senate because leaders can’t be afraid of the tough questions. They should stand with, not run from, the people they serve.”
Marshall, who was elected to the Senate in 2020 and replaced retiring GOP U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts, previously served four years in the U.S. House. A frequent supporter of President Donald Trump, Marshall said in an interview he would seek reelection in 2026.
“When Kansans pressed him on tariffs that crushed our farmers and health care cuts that closed our hospitals, he couldn’t defend himself,” Spidel Neumann said. “So, he took his toys and went home. That’s not leadership. Kansans deserve a senator who shows up, listens and fights for us.”
Spidel Neumann joined three other Democrats with campaigns to seek the Democratic Party’s nomination in the August primary election. The others are Christy Davis of Cottonwood Falls, attorney Anne Parelkar of Overland Park and Michael Soetaert of Wellington.
Spidel Neumann was born near Topeka and grew up in Overland Park. She earned an economics degree at the University of Chicago and a master’s in business at Northwestern University.
She had a 40-year career in business that culminated with 22 years as an executive with Ameriprise Financial Services. She retired in May and has not held public office.
“In business, I’ve seen what happens when leaders fall short. Like when Roger sells out Kansas time and again, and then jets off to his Florida mansion,” Spidel Neumann said. “You don’t need a degree in economics to recognize what he touts as accomplishments — chaotic tariffs, health care cuts and tax breaks for himself and his billionaire buddies. They all hurt the Kansans he left behind.”
She accused Marshall of declining to “stand up to special interests” as Kansas families were forced to choose between gas and groceries while hospitals disappeared, farmers struggled economically and seniors skipped medication to make ends meet.
“Washington won’t fix itself. It’s time for someone who knows how to get things done,” she said. “I’ve always rooted for the red and the blue, but most of all, I root for Kansas.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Sandy-Spidel-Neumann-1024x573.png,,,2025-10-16 12:04:40.336283

“He was part of a legacy of a family ranch in Nebraska,” Marshall Hansen said. “I think it made him very proud that he carried that on and that he could pass it on to my brother.”
Hansen died Saturday after a long battle with multiple health issues. He was 78.
A Republican, he served as a state senator from 2007-15, earning a reputation of being able to work with Democrats and to keep things light amid the sometimes pressure-cooker atmosphere at the Capitol. One of his best friends at the Unicameral was a Democrat, State Sen. Bill Avery of Lincoln, Hansen’s oldest son said.
“He was good at consensus building,” said Pete McClymont, a retired executive vice president of the Cattlemen who lobbied state senators.
“I’ve never heard anyone say a bad word about Tom Hansen. That says a lot about his character,” McClymont added.
Hansen’s service in the Legislature and with the Cattlemen were as much a family tradition as running the ranch.
His grandfather, Henry, served in the Nebraska House of Representatives from 1925 to 1933, and from 1935 to 1937 — the year the state switched to its unique Unicameral Legislature.
Tom Hansen served as the president of the Nebraska Cattlemen, the state’s premiere organization for beef producers, after both his grandfather and father, Wes, had served as president of one of the Cattlemen’s forerunners, the Nebraska Stockgrowers.
In a couple of years, Eric Hansen — now a vice president of the Cattlemen — will ascend to the presidency, becoming the fourth member of his family to head the organization’s board.
The Cattlemen, in a statement issued this week, called Tom Hansen “a legend in the beef cattle industry” who “exemplified what it meant to be a servant leader.”
A graduate of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s agriculture school, Hansen married his wife, Linda, in 1967 and returned to the ranch to raise red Angus.
Prior to being elected to the Legislature, he was active on the boards of the Twin Platte Natural Resources District, Nebraskaland Days, the Mid-Nebraska Community Foundation Board and Messiah Lutheran Church.
The Hansen Ranch hosted the Cattle Baron’s Ball in 1995 to raise money for cancer research. Ten years later, Hansen was inducted into the Nebraska Cattlemen’s Hall of Fame.
Western attire is urged for funeral services scheduled at 11 a.m., Saturday, at First Evangelical Lutheran Church in North Platte. Visitation is from noon to 6 p.m. Friday at Adams & Swanson Funeral Home in North Platte, with the family receiving friends from 4-6 p.m.

Bill Lee on Oct. 3, 2025. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said Tuesday that the “Memphis Safe Task Force” is focused on violent crime, and that the coalition of 31 agencies has already arrested “850 violent criminals and known gang members.”
But a look at the task force’s operations on Monday shows that most of the people arrested were not charged with a violent crime, and immigrants are being arrested on administrative — not criminal — warrants, according to a document obtained by MLK50: Justice Through Journalism.
The document, provided by the task force to local public officials, details arrests made on one full day of task force operations, Monday, Oct. 13. That day, 1,561 personnel from 31 agencies were working in Memphis.

The document states that 51 arrests were made on Monday. It does not list traffic stops where there was no arrest. It does not specify which agency made each arrest or whether the data is separated from the regular operations of the Memphis Police Department. One “missing child” was also found that day, according to the document. She was found living with her father in California.
The document also indicates that task force members responded to a shooting that left one man dead and another injured. The person was treated for a gunshot wound and taken into custody pending an investigation.
Concern growing among immigrants
Lee dismissed concerns about how the task force is impacting immigrant communities at the press conference on Tuesday.
“If you’re here illegally and you commit a crime, then obviously ICE is going to be involved in that. But the effort, the goal, the purpose, is to go after crime in the city,” he said. “If they’re not a criminal element, then they shouldn’t be afraid.”
Yet, none of the seven people — who came from Senegal, Guatemala and Mexico — that were arrested for being “unlawfully present in the United States” on Monday were described as having criminal charges. “Unlawful presence” is a civil offense, and not a crime.
Another man was described as an “illegal alien” and charged with theft of a motor vehicle, felony evading and possession of drug paraphernalia, but the document did not detail any immigration-related charges for him. Another part of the document said there were nine administrative arrests during that time period, but MLK50 only found seven noted in the anecdotes.

Tuesday, Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris held a news conference in which he described instances of possible racial profiling, saying those anecdotes “have made us uncomfortable.”
“Racial profiling is unconstitutional,” Harris said.
Carlos Ochoa, who spoke at Harris’ news conference on behalf of Vecindarios 901, said volunteers at the community hotline and in their network have spoken to residents reporting changes in immigrant neighborhoods. A few weeks ago, armed federal agents and state agents “swooped into” the park alongside the Marion Hale Community Center, Ochoa said. Normally a hub of activity, the bleachers and park are now empty, Ochoa said.
“We see parents afraid to leave their homes,” Ochoa said. “We see children missing school because safety feels uncertain. We see workers avoiding medical care because survival demands invisibility, families forced from our neighborhoods. We even see US citizens being arrested by ICE in my neighborhood.”
At Harris’ press conference, immigration attorney Colton Bane described how one of his clients was expecting his green card to arrive “any day,” but was pulled over on his way home from work. Now, he’s sitting in detention. Others have described having their driver’s licenses taken away by law enforcement and not returned, even when they are allowed to leave the traffic stop, Bane said.
“The only long-lasting effect I’m seeing from this task force are further fractured relationships between our immigrant community and the local law enforcement who will be here after this operation,” Bane said.
Thousands of citations, 320 warrants served
Of the 44 non-immigration arrests on Monday, only 13 were clearly for violent crimes, according to an MLK50 analysis of the data. Five people arrested were described as gang members, but the document did not explain how that was determined.
Thirty of the 44 people arrested had not been charged with violent offenses. Instead, their charges ranged from failure to appear in court for a misdemeanor to identity theft to trespassing and misdemeanor theft of property. Seven of those non-violent charges were drug-related. One arrest could not be clearly identified as a violent or nonviolent charge.
One arrest anecdote in the document described a 17-year-old in Frayser who was “observed standing in front of a business for several minutes.”
“When approached by law enforcement, subject fled on foot,” the document said. The youth was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, criminal trespass, evading and obstructing.
Another anecdote told of a young man arrested for “possession of a controlled substance.” Officials recovered marijuana.
A woman was arrested on a warrant for misdemeanor theft of property: Property worth less than $1,000.
Five people were arrested on gun charges, three for possessing a firearm “during the commission of a dangerous felony,” seemingly referring to drug charges.
Tuesday, Memphis Mayor Paul Young, who stood alongside Lee at the governor’s press conference, said a significant amount of the work underway is the execution of warrants. When the operation began, the city had about 10,000 felony warrants, he said.
Out of the 854 arrests made by the task force as of Monday, 320 appeared to be for outstanding warrants, according to the document. The second highest category of arrests was “administrative,” 168, referring to arrests made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for civil, not criminal, immigration violations.
As of Monday, the task force had also issued 4,160 traffic citations and 59 misdemeanor citations. Details of those interactions and citations were not immediately available.

Jay Collins participates in the extradition from California of Harjinder Singh, accused of causing an accident that killed three people in Florida. (Via Collins' X account)After an undocumented truck driver licensed in California and Washington killed three Floridians in a road accident, state Attorney General James Uthmeier is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to let him sue those states, seeking federal preemption of their “sanctuary” laws.
Uthmeier announced the effort Wednesday night on the Fox News’ “Hannity,” blaming California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, for enacting laws that Uthmeier believes harm American citizens.
The announcement came a month after Uthmeier subpoenaed the trucking firm employing Harjinder Singh, the Indian national who caused a fatal accident in St. Lucie County over the summer.
“It’s a shame, and that’s why we’re taking Gavin Newsom to the Supreme Court … to hold them accountable for the carnage that their sanctuary illegal immigration policies have caused to states like Florida,” Uthmeier said on the show.
“We can do everything right … but we still suffer when Gavin Newsom and liberals on the West Coast allow these illegals in. They encourage them — enable them — to get these drivers’ licenses, and then they cross the country and ultimately take lives.”
The suit comes amid a nationwide crack down on undocumented immigration, spearheaded by President Donald Trump and buttressed by Gov. Ron DeSantis in Florida through sweeping, state-level immigration laws. Trump signed a slew of executive orders on his first day in office, including a mandate for English proficiency among truck drivers.
Hours before Uthmeier filed his case, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration will withhold more than $40 million from California following an investigation that found the state failed to comply with the Department’s English language proficiency standards.
Jeremy Redfern, Uthmeier’s communications director, told the Florida Phoenix that DOT’s announcement was a coincidence that “just happened” on the same day.
The accident bore other national ramifications, including prompting Secretary of State Marco Rubio to temporarily freeze visas for foreign-born truck drivers.
What is Uthmeier asking the Supreme Court to do?
Wednesday night, Uthmeier asked the justices for permission to bypass the usual appeals process and file his lawsuit directly with the Supreme Court. In a 30-page complaint, he accused California and Washington of “open defiance” of federal immigration laws, citing their laws banning agencies from asking about immigration status and issuance of a commercial driver’s license to a man who failed an English proficiency test.
Uthmeier seeks:

A declaratory judgement federally preempting the states’ laws preventing agency inquiries into immigration status for commercial license applicants
A declaratory judgement deriding their “failure” to enforce immigration-status standards as a “public nuisance.”
A permanent ban against California and Washington issuing commercial licenses to noncitizens.
An order that California and Washington pay Florida’s legal fees.

The case stemmed from an Aug. 12 crash on a St. Lucie highway caused by Singh, who was illegally in the United States but licensed as commercial driver in both California and Washington. From India, Singh had failed an English proficiency test, but was still licensed to drive for the White Hawk Carriers Inc. trucking firm.
A video from a camera within his truck cab shows the 28-year-old making a U-turn across four lanes of traffic in an 18-wheeler, killing three Haitian immigrants in a vehicle that slammed into his rig. Florida troopers drew Singh’s blood in the aftermath of the crash, brought someone who could speak his language to question him, and then let him go due to a lack of probable cause.
Singh left for California, was arrested by U.S. marshals in the San Francisco Bay Area, and was extradited to the Sunshine State by Lt. Gov. Jay Collins.

By Jamie Kleman | Contributing Journalist Delaware Live | October 2025
Delaware educators are turning a new page this fall with the launch of the state’s Early Literacy Plan, a multi-year initiative designed to boost reading skills for the youngest learners and support teachers with evidence-based instruction. The plan, announced by the Delaware Department of Education (DDOE), aims to ensure every student in grades K-3 can read proficiently by the end of third grade – a milestone that research shows is critical for long-term academic success.
A Focus on the “Science of Reading”
The Early Literacy Plan centers on the science of reading, an approach grounded in decades of research on how children learn to decode, comprehend, and enjoy written language. Delaware joins a growing number of states using this framework to reshape early reading instruction and teacher preparation.
“Strong literacy skills open every door for a child – from math to science to lifelong learning,” said Secretary of Education Mark Holodick in the state’s announcement. “This plan ensures teachers have the tools, training, and time they need to make that happen.”
The initiative includes new professional development for teachers, updated reading curriculum aligned with the science of reading, and resources for families to reinforce learning at home.
Closing Gaps and Supporting Educators
While many Delaware schools already use evidence-based reading programs, the plan provides a consistent statewide structure and addresses disparities in access to high-quality materials. It also creates new pathways for reading specialists and literacy coaches to collaborate across districts.
According to state data, 43% of Delaware third-graders are reading at grade level. The Early Literacy Plan’s goal is to close that gap within five years by aligning teacher training, instructional materials, and assessments.
“Teachers have always known the power of early reading,” said Dover elementary teacher Angela Morris. “What’s exciting about this plan is that it gives us a shared language and consistent support system. We can finally focus less on testing and more on helping kids fall in love with reading.”
Families as Reading Partners
Parents and caregivers are also a key part of the plan’s success. The DDOE has launched a companion website with family toolkits that include storytime activities, phonics games, and strategies to build reading confidence at home. The site emphasizes that just 15 minutes of daily reading can significantly improve fluency and vocabulary by the end of elementary school.
Libraries and community centers across Delaware are expected to host literacy nights and family workshops beginning in early 2026.
Building a Culture of Reading
The Early Literacy Plan reflects Delaware’s broader effort to invest in student success from the earliest years – complementing initiatives like expanded pre-K access and high-impact tutoring.
“This is about giving every child, regardless of zip code, a strong start,” Holodick said. “If we get reading right, we get everything else right.”

(Photo by Rebecca Rivas/The Missouri Independent) The union representing 3,200 Boeing Defense workers on strike in the St. Louis area said it has filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the National Labor Relations Board against the company. 
The complaint follows an Oct. 8 letter sent to workers by Boeing Executive Vice President Steve Parker, where he urged employees to take the company’s final offer.
“No matter how long the strike lasts, the economics won’t change,” Parker wrote in his letter. “The bottom line is firm. Each of the offers we’ve put forward would give you a better deal than anything comparable we’ve seen in our region and industry…”
The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 said in a press release Thursday that Parker’s statements “make clear the company’s refusal to bargain in good faith.” 
The union said the company’s repeated rejections of the union proposals “without making any counter offers addressing member concerns” is a violation of federal labor law to negotiate in good faith.
“This strike is about respect and fairness,” said Tom Boelling, IAM District 837 directing business representative, in a Thursday press release. “Our members are standing up for their families, their future, and for fair treatment at the bargaining table. Boeing’s delays are hurting its own production, putting critical defense contracts at risk, and showing that you can’t replace skilled union labor with untrained temps.”
Boeing Defense did not immediately respond to The Independent’s request for comment.
The strike began Aug. 4, just months after Boeing was awarded a government contract to build the Air Force’s next-generation fighter jet, the F-47.
The company landed the contract because of “the ingenuity and skill of IAM Union members who have dedicated their careers to building America’s fighter aircraft,” the press release states.
“These men and women have decades of skill, experience, and dedication,” said Sam Cicinelli, IAM Union Midwest territory general vice president. “Boeing’s CEO is paid tens of millions of dollars, while the workers who build our military jets are being told to settle for less than they deserve. That’s unacceptable — and people on both sides of the aisle in Congress are taking notice.”
Cicinelli said lawmakers from both parties have called on Boeing to negotiate in good faith, because this strike and the company’s refusal to bargain is hurting our national defense. 
Boeing and union representatives met with a federal mediator last month, in an effort to find a path to end the strike. 
But both issued statements that the negotiations failed. The union said Boeing refused to budge, and the company said union reps came to the table with “unrealistic” expectations. 
“As we have said multiple times, we are open to constructive feedback from the union within the overall economics of our offer, which is at the top of the market for Midwest manufacturing,” according to a statement Boeing issued Monday.
The union countered by saying the way to end the strike would be “the sensible pre-ratified offer that was approved by our membership. We are available when the company has an improved offer.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Boeing-strike-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-16 12:04:40.336283

(Photo by Peter Cade/Getty Images)Ohio lawmakers are wrestling over how to keep kids from seeing what they shouldn’t online.
Courts have already put on hold an age verification system written into the 2023 budget. A hastily written provision tucked into this year’s budget was meant to keep kids from visiting porn websites. But as drafted, several large players contend the restrictions don’t apply to them.
And in an Ohio Senate committee hearing this week, lawmakers heard from supporters of two more age verification proposals. One has the backing of the tech giants who run app stores. The other has the support of child safety advocates, as well as different tech giants whose apps appear in those app stores.
Meanwhile the fight is extending beyond Columbus. In the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the ACLU of Ohio filed an amicus brief urging the court to reject an appeal aimed at resurrecting the 2023 age verification system. Also, the Digital Childhood Institute, which is backing one of the Ohio bills, has filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission against Google. The group alleges Google knows which app store users are kids, but “knowingly markets harmful apps as safe for minors.”
The legislation
Ohio Senators heard from supporters of Senate Bill 167 and Senate Bill 175 in a committee hearing this week, bills that look fairly similar overall. Apps and app stores share an “age signal” to verify a user is old enough to use an app. Both measures mandate the availability of parental controls and task the attorney general with enforcement. Both sides even offer similar arguments, insisting their approach represents “a shared responsibility” or a way to ensure “every player is doing their part.”
But the bills differ on one central question: who bears responsibility for keeping ineligible users out?
Senate Bill 167 puts the onus on app stores.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“So, it’s really a simple ‘one place’ to do this, where the information already likely exists,” said Jennifer Hanley, Meta’s head of safety policy for North America.
When a person sets up an account with an app store they typically provide information about their age. Because the app store already has that user information, Hanley said, it’s the most logical place to restrict access based on age.
“Teens use up to 40 different apps a week,” she said. “So, without a centralized age verification system within the app store, parents would have to share personal information with each of these 40 different apps that teens might be using.”
Senate Bill 175, on the other hand, requires individual applications to build the moat. Matthew Bye, a managing director for Google, argued it’s the apps who should “provide parental controls and get a parent’s permission to provide access to any mature content.”
“It focuses protections where they’re needed the most, and it’s built on common sense,” he added.
Bye dismissed verifying a user’s age at the app store level as “invasive and unnecessary.”
“Imagine having to show your driver’s license just to download a weather app,” he said.
Both proposals got a pretty frosty welcome from lawmakers.
State Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, said both proposals amounted to censorship. What about a young woman who wants to track her periods? What about elderly Ohioans who just can’t figure out how to verify their age?
Sen. Bill Blessing, R-Colerain Twp., argued parents already have parental control tools, and he criticized both measures for relying on the attorney general to enforce the law. The first Senate bill, that would have app stores conduct age verification, has a narrow private cause of action; the other Senate bill explicitly has none. Blessing suggested giving a single elected official sole responsibility for policing some of the largest companies in the world might not end well.
“The problem with that is we create this regulatory capture, where all you have to do is control the AG’s office,” Blessing said. “Which means, hey, they don’t have to sue, and there really is no enforcement mechanism for this bill.”
The FTC complaint
While the Digital Childhood Institute was testifying to state senators for the bill to put the onus on app stores, the group was also filing a complaint against Google with the Federal Trade Commission. DCI President Melissa McKay told lawmakers parental controls are porous, app ratings aren’t reliable and kids shouldn’t be allowed to consent to app contracts. In its FTC complaint, the Digital Childhood Institute elaborated on those arguments.
Google offers parents the illusion of control, the group claims, noting children can “unilaterally withdraw” from parental oversight once they’re 13.
“By allowing a child to terminate oversight at a critical stage of development, Google negates its own promises of safety and gives parents a false sense of security, making these assurances deceptive under consumer protection standards,” the complaint states.
DCI explained Google relies on app age ratings from an outside group that are largely “generated through developer self-reporting with minimal oversight.” And the group criticized Google for allowing minors to agree to contracts with app developers.
“No title company or bank would treat a contract signed by a child as valid without parental consent, yet Google does exactly that at scale,” DCI stated.
“In any other industry,” the complaint added, “this would be recognized as legally and ethically indefensible.”
But the remedies DCI has in mind are sweeping. The group insists two “simple, common-sense steps would transform online safety overnight.”
First, obscenity anywhere on the internet should be blocked unless a user has first verified that they are an adult. DCI contends this makes “safety the default” and aligns with a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding a Texas law requiring porn websites verify a user’s age. Second, DCI wants a free “child-friendly browser” to be the default for kids under 18, with parents given the choice to allow a standard browser instead.
The amicus brief
In the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the ACLU of Ohio took aim at a different age verification system for a taking a similarly broad-brush approach.
“Simply put, this statute violates the First Amendment. Aside from certain, specific categories of speech — most notably obscenity — minors have the same First Amendment rights as adults,” ACLU of Ohio Chief Legal Officer Freda Levenson argued.
ACLU of Ohio Legislative Director Gary Daniels added, “We also continue to monitor similar bills before the General Assembly which similarly, albeit not identically, restrict minors’ access to constitutionally protected speech.”
In an amicus brief, the ACLU acknowledged state officials had noble intentions but insisted the age verification statute is a mess. Determining which users need to provide parental consent would likely wind up requiring companies check every user’s age. And to determine who can provide consent for a specific underage user would require even deeper identity verification.
“The act will block minors and adults from accessing and engaging in speech they have every right to access and engage in online,” the ACLU stated.
While DCI looked to the Texas case to bolster its FTC complaint, the ACLU drew a distinction. The U.S. Supreme Court determined Texas officials were able to regulate access to sexual material because minors don’t have a constitutional right to access it.
“Minors suffer no such limitation when it comes to any other speech, including the plethora of political, religious, artistic, and educational content available on social media,” the ACLU wrote.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Drawing on his experience as a federal prosecutor, the first Democrat to enter the 2026 race for attorney general said he views the role as a nonpartisan leader that will “call out illegal and unethical behavior” where he sees it.
Nick Coffey, 34, spent seven years as an Oklahoma City-based assistant U.S. attorney prosecuting criminal organizations, drug conspiracies, illegal firearms, immigration cases, fraud and more.
Coffey, of Oklahoma City, said he thinks the election will come down to which candidate has the right experience, rather than the preferred party affiliation, to become the top law enforcement officer in the state. He said most Oklahomans want an attorney general who’s familiar with a courtroom and who’s worked closely with law enforcement.
“I think that I have a lot of faith that they’re going to say that, regardless of party, this is the guy that we can trust and will get the job done,” Coffey said in an interview with Oklahoma Voice.
He described the attorney general’s race as “a career prosecutor versus individuals that have been either in politics and never done a jury trial before or just have been a member of the political elite.” 
Former House Majority Floor Leader Jon Echols and Oklahoma Energy and Environment Secretary Jeff Starling, both Republicans, are the only other candidates who have entered the race, so far.
Attorney General Gentner Drummond, also a Republican, is running for governor. 
This is the first political campaign for Coffey, a fifth-generation Oklahoman and graduate of the University of Oklahoma College of Law. 
He left the U.S. Attorney’s Office last month to launch his campaign and is now working as a trial attorney at the Crowe Dunlevy law firm. It’s his second stint in private practice after starting his career at the Oklahoma City firm McAfee & Taft.
If elected, he said he would prioritize public safety, consumer protection and positive partnerships with tribal nations. Coffey pledged to hold the political elite equally accountable to the law.
“I have no history in or experience in politics,” Coffey said. “I’m just a guy like millions of Oklahomans that went to work every day and tried to do the best that they could do. Now, my job entailed, as a federal prosecutor, holding people accountable. And that’s what I would do as attorney general. I want to bring a sense of independence to the office.”

Alexis Simmons, D-Topeka, says an Oct. 15, 2025, interim committee hearing was a partisan presentation of election reform ideas.

Alexis Simmons waited until conservative Earl Glynn finished a lengthy presentation of proposed reforms to Kansas election law before raising objections with colleagues about the partisan approach of a House and Senate committee assigned to work on campaign-finance transparency.
Simmons, a Topeka Democrat, asserted Glynn epitomized the ideological tilt of the interim committee against Democrat-aligned organizations. She said focusing on testimony by conservatives who ignored Republican-leaning groups was a disservice to the public.
“I find it not factually appropriate to have only focused on the left,” Simmons said. “I think if we’re going to be making changes to the law around campaign transparency and integrity in our elections that we need to have fair, accurate, factual discussions. This is not.”
Glynn, a retired data scientist from Olathe and a member of the Kansas Public Disclosure Commission, recommended Kansas crack down on nonprofit organizations that he suspected of abusing rules on issue advocacy. He condemned Kansas Values Institute, which had a prominent financial role in opposing a proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution to restrict abortion rights. In 2022, the amendment was overwhelmingly rejected by voters.
Nonprofit tax-exempt organizations should be banned from registering voters in Kansas if they targeted partisan segments of the population, he said.
Glynn also endorsed Wyoming’s decision to drop everyone from that state’s voter registration list who didn’t participate in a federal general election. He said voter rolls in Kansas were stuffed with hundreds of thousands of inactive voters who must be removed. He complained about the state’s inability to make campaign finance data more accessible to him and the lack of clarity about who was financing two new Kansas political parties.
“I have a serious concern, frankly, with the entire presentation,” Simmons said. “This felt like an incredibly partisan presentation given during what should be a constructive and transparent committee hearing with integrity.”
“All the nonprofits I talked about are nonpartisan nonprofits,” Glynn said. “How could I be partisan if I’m talking about nonpartisan nonprofits?”
Simmons continued: “I find that insulting to the intellect of this committee to pretend like this is a fair analysis of the state.”
Kansas organizations involved in previous Kansas election reform debates, including the League of Women Voters of Kansas, Loud Light and American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, weren’t on the committee’s agenda.
“Challenge me on my facts,” Glynn said.
Rep. Kirk Haskins, also a Topeka Democrat, picked up the line of questioning. He asked Glynn how he factored personal ideological bias in his research.
“I’m a conservative, center-right person,” Glynn said.
“Obviously, the ones that you selected supported the Democratic ideology,” Haskins said. “I’m just curious in your blog or any findings that are related to GOP-leaning nonprofits?”
“I probably don’t currently, but I have in the past,” Glynn replied.
The back-and-forth among Simmons, Haskins and Glynn illustrated intensity of political opinion about demands to reform Kansas’ electoral system.

‘Works both ways’
Sen. Mike Thompson, the Shawnee Republican and chairman of the interim committee, said the exchange initiated by Simmons was out of order.
“Representative, let’s move on. You’re just using this as an opportunity to attack,” Thompson said.
Committee members Rep. Pat Proctor, R-Leavenworth, and Sen. Caryn Tyson, R-Parker, came to Glynn’s defense.
“Thank you, Earl, for being here,” Tyson said. “I’ve known you for years. You are somebody that knows the data, studied the data. You’ve been studying voter data since before it was even an item in Kansas. So, I really appreciate your presentation.”
During a subsequent 10-minute break in the meeting Wednesday, Simmons attempted to speak one-on-one with Glynn to express her disappointment that he had laughed at her criticism.
“It works both ways,” Glynn said.
Tyson stepped into their conversation and accused Simmons of looking for a fight.
“No, I’m looking for respect,” Simmons said. “My point is, please do not come to committee and laugh at members.”
“I didn’t intentionally laugh at you. It was your comments,” Glynn said. “I’m sorry if you were offended, but that wasn’t intended. No disrespect was intended.”
Tyson directed another thought at Simmons: “Oh, my God. I’ve never met somebody so rude.”

Indexing donations
The committee’s agenda featured a presentation by David Keating and Bradley Smith of the Institute for Free Speech, which uses litigation, research and education to promote the deregulation of elections. The organization has opposed campaign finance restrictions, including limits on contributions, primarily on First Amendment grounds.
They told the legislative committee disclosure of low-dollar campaign donors created “cancel culture concerns” for contributors and complicated fundraising. The duo recommended Kansas raise donor disclosure thresholds and tie contribution limits to inflation. They said Kansas ought to require redaction from public view of the street address of campaign donors, which would prevent potential “violence or harassment” of contributors.
“Simplify the system as much as possible,” said Keating, president of the Institute for Free Speech.
Josh Ney, an attorney with KN Law Group in Olathe, also addressed the committee. He has represented Kansas conservatives in disputes about investigation of potential campaign finance violations, as well as assertions that grassroots activists engaged in local politics should register as lobbyists.
He proposed the Legislature address a problem in which political adversaries of his clients relied on civil subpoena power to seek access to their confidential communications with government officials. Use of a subpoena for that purpose should be forbidden on constitutional grounds, he said.
At conclusion of the committee’s meeting, House and Senate members proposed the Legislature review campaign finance limits and possibly link caps to inflation. A majority said the Legislature should consider requiring candidates and political action committees to report small-dollar donations to state regulators even if that information wasn’t distributed publicly.
Tyson, the Republican senator, said the Legislature ought to take action to address false information in political mailers and advertising.
“We need to look at that threshold for slander and libel against legislators or elected officials that are also committing it,” Tyson said.
Rep. Shawn Chauncey, R-Junction City, said scrutiny of political advertising should be a priority because bogus claims damaged voter impressions of the character of candidates and was hurtful to candidates’ families.
Proctor, the House Republican running for secretary of state in 2026, said Kansas also should tame “shadowy nonprofits” that narrowly avoided violation of election regulations and made use of millions of dollars in contributions to influence political outcomes.
Sen. Marci Francisco, D-Lawrence, encouraged the committee to support a law enabling Kansans to register on Election Day. She said the state should take that step if lawmakers made it easier to remove people from registration rolls. Her proposal, however, wasn’t included in the committee’s report.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Alexis-Simmons-hearing-2-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-16 11:03:44.560818

College golf takes center stage this weekend at Fallen Oak, the Beau Rivage casino’s hidden treasure in the otherwise sleepy community of Saucier, a few miles from the sandy beaches of Gulfport and Biloxi.
There, Ole Miss, Mississippi State and Southern Miss will combine to host the 14-team Fallen Oak Invitational, which in just three years has become one of the most prestigious fall  college golf tournaments in America. Fourteen teams, including eight from the SEC and three from the Big 10 Conference, will compete.
Rick Cleveland
“This is what we had in mind when we got this thing started,” said Chris Malloy, coach of the No. 4 ranked Ole Miss Rebels. “This is an outstanding field, one of the best you will see in college golf, and they will be challenged by a world class, championship course. Fallen Oak is special.”
Ole Miss, which boasts defending NCAA Champion Michael La Sasso, rates as the tournament favorite with its national ranking and three of the world’s top 45 amateur golfers. La Sasso ranks No. 9, Cameron Tankersley No. 17 and Cohen Trolio No. 45 in the latest world amateur golf rankings.
The Rebels have finished in the top three of all their previous three fall tournaments: a second at the Knoxville Collegiate, a victory at the Honors Course Collegiate at Chattanooga, and a third at the Hamptons Intercollegiate in New York. They played two of the three without La Sasso, who was participating in PGA Tour tournaments.
“Do I think we’re playing our best golf? No, probably not yet,” Malloy said. “But if you told me we’d play two of our first three tournaments without the defending NCAA Champion, have the finishes we had and be ranked like we are, I think anybody would sign up for that. I’m pleased with where we are. I like this squad.”
Mississippi State and Southern Miss also have had good starts to the season. State is coming off a victory in the Cullen Brown Collegiate, hosted by Kentucky. For the first time in school history, Southern Miss won two straight tournaments, the JT Poston Invitational at Waynesville, North Carolina, and the Badger Invitational at Madison, Wisconsin, where the Golden Eagles shot 23-under par for 54 holes and won by 10 shots.
“I think we’re playing some really solid golf,” said State coach Dusty Smith. “Winning at Kentucky was certainly a step in the right direction. We’re looking forward to building on that at Fallen Oak.”
Jake Moffitt, Mississippi State Am champion,  will pla y for USM.
Eddie Brescher’s Southern Miss team might be the best in school history, featuring Mississippi State Amateur champion Jake Moffitt of Ripley who won the State Am in record-breaking fashion at Grand Bear, just a few miles from Fallen Oak. Moffitt, a 19-year-old freshman, has averaged a team-best 69.67 strokes per round for his first 12 rounds of college golf.
The Golden Eagles are coming off a disappointing final round performance in the Little Rock Buick GMC Classic earlier this week, dropping from second to sixth place in the 16-team field with the team’s first over-par round of the season.
“We weren’t happy with how we finished,” Brescher said. “But I know we have a good team. We’ll just hit the reset button and try to get on another win streak.”
All three of the Mississippi coaches believe their collective success is a reflection on junior golf in the state. All three feature players who came up through various Mississippi junior programs, including the Rebels’ Trolio of West Point, who made the U.S. Amateur semifinals as a 17-year-old high school player at Oak Hill Academy, and his younger brother Colin. 
“I think the success these teams have had is a reflection on Mississippi golf as a whole,” said State’s Smith, whose team includes junior Drew Wilson of Potts Camp and freshman Jackson Cook, another product of the remarkable Oak Hill Academy program that plays out of Old Waverly in West Point.
All three Mississippi coaches also take pride in hosting the Fallen Oak event, which has some unique features, including Jumbotrons behind the ninth and 18th greens that will be showing college football teams during Saturday’s first round. The tournament also includes a Friday pro-am-styled event during which the college golfers will be paired with sponsors and hosts of the tournament.
Besides the three Mississippi teams, the field includes Alabama, Arkansas, Chattanooga, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana State  University, South Carolina, Tennessee, University of Nevada, Las Vegas and Wisconsin. Said USM’s Brescher, “It’s about as close as you’re going to get to a post-season quality field during the fall.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/09150838/Malloy-congratulantes-La-Sasso.-.jpg,,,2025-10-16 10:04:17.682684

Alaska's outbreak of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, has subsided after peaking in the fall of 2024. (Image by Dan Higgins/provided by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)Alaska’s outbreak of pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, has now subsided, but it created some significant impacts for residents, state data shows.
The outbreak ran from April 2024 to 2025. During that 12-month period, there were 679 confirmed or probable cases reported in the state, said a newly released bulletin from the Alaska Division of Health’s epidemiology section.
Pertussis is caused by a bacterial infection and is highly contagious.
Among them were 74 infants younger than 1 who got the disease, most were not up to date on their vaccinations, the bulletin said.
Twenty-nine patients were hospitalized, most of them infants under 1 year old, the bulletin said.
One unvaccinated baby died during the outbreak, the bulletin said.
Vaccination provided significant protection to Alaska children, earlier research showed.
In the summer and fall of 2024, when the outbreak was at its peak, unvaccinated Alaska children were more than 13 times as likely to contract the disease than those who had received all their pertussis vaccinations, the bulletin said.
The peak of the outbreak was in September 2024, when there were 155 cases reported statewide. That peak coincided with a big uptick in vaccine orders in late summer of 2024, and a record number of vaccines were given to Alaskans in September, Dr. Elizabeth Ohlsen, a staff physician with the epidemiology section, said by email.
“Overall, we are glad to see that the vast majority of Alaskans choose to protect themselves and their children against pertussis” by adhering to the recommended immunization schedule, Ohlsen said.
The pertussis vaccine is combined with vaccines for diphtheria and tetanus. The recommended schedule includes vaccination of expectant mothers during their third trimester of pregnancy – the only available protection against the disease for the youngest infants. For children, the recommended schedule is for four doses by 18 months of age, followed by a booster when children are between 4 and 6. Boosters are also recommended every 10 years for teens and adults.
Ohlsen emphasized the need for vaccination during pregnancy.
“This boosts maternal immunity in a way that gets passed on to the infant. This is so important because infants <6 months old are the most likely to get seriously ill if they get pertussis,” she said by email.
By geography, about a third of the reported cases were in Anchorage and 20% were in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. The rest were scattered around the state.
While Anchorage had the highest number of cases, 228, it had the lowest rate among the state’s regions: 78 per 100,000 people. The Southwest region, with 82 cases, had the highest regional rate, at 198 per 100,000 people, the bulletin said.
Alaska’s outbreak happened at about the same time as a national surge in the disease that peaked in November, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens (3-3, 1-2 CUSA) turned the ball over twice in the first half leading to 14 Jacksonville State points in the Gamecocks’ 38-25 win Wednesday night.
 
NEWARK — The Fightin’ Blue Hens quarterback Nick Minicucci stood at his own 43 yard line in the shotgun formation. Three receivers lined up to his right as the junior received the snap needing to gain four yards on fourth down. 
Minicucci looked toward the trio of receivers and connected with Jake Thaw on a curl route near the line to gain. Thaw turned to his left as a pair of Gamecock defenders descended upon him. Thaw powered through the tackle and stretched his arms out to guarantee the conversion, but instead of moving the chains Thaw’s effort resulted in a bigger Blue Hen deficit.
As Thaw pulled the ball back to his chest, freshman linebacker Mac Sanders ripped the ball loose. The ball dribbled down the field until safety Caleb Nix recovered it and ran 46 yards to the endzone. Nix’s score gave Jacksonville State a two possession lead it never relinquished, beating the University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens, 38-25, Wednesday night in Jacksonville, Alabama. 
Thaw’s fumble was the second of three for the Blue Hens in the first half that resulted in the Gamecocks’ first two scores.
The first fumble occurred on the first play of UD’s second drive of the game on a pass from Minicucci to tight end Elijah Sessoms. Sessoms caught the junior’s pass and took a couple steps before colliding with safety Travis Franklin Jr. Franklin’s tackle forced the ball loose. 
Walker O’Steen recovered the fumble and ran it back to Delaware’s 11 yard line. The Gamecocks offense scored a touchdown on their ensuing drive via a six yard run from Cam Cook earning an early advantage. 
The Blue Hens second fumble resulted in Nix’s fumble recovery and the third was a minor blunder in the backfield by Minicucci that he fell on avoiding a third turnover.
The miscues were the main catalyst for Jacksonville State’s scoring in the half, because of the stellar job UD’s defense did at slowing CUSA’s top ranked rushing offense. 
The Gamecocks entered the game averaging over 250 rushing yards per game led by the nation’s leading rusher, Cam Cook. Cook entered the game with 832 rushing yards and seven rushing touchdowns averaging over 130 ground yards a game. 
The Blue Hens limited Cook’s impact to just 35 rushing yards in the first half and forced the Gamecocks to throw the ball 16 times — just one off from their 17 total attempts a week ago.
Jacksonville State quarterback Caden Creel executed well completing 11 of those throws in just his second start of the season. Creel’s biggest play of the first half was a 23-yard touchdown pass to his leading receiver Brock Rechsteiner that gave Jacksonville State a 21-0 lead halfway through the second quarter.
The Blue Hens offense struggled to generate any rhythm or flow following the turnovers. Their only score of the first half came before the two minute timeout on a one yard run from Viron Ellison Jr. It was the first of three touchdowns for the sophomore running back and it cut the Gamecocks’ lead to 15 going into half time.
The majority of the offense was a product of Minicucci’s right arm connecting with 11 different receivers throughout the night for 422 yards and a touchdown. UD tried to push the ball downfield throughout the night, consistently throwing deep passes to receivers matched up one on one downfield. The approach generated ten passing plays of 15 or more yards, but those big plays weren’t enough to sustain a comeback attempt. 
UD outscored Jacksonville State by 2 points in the second half, but it couldn’t overcome the turnovers and season high 10 penalties. 
Cook matched Ellison’s production with two more touchdown runs in the second half and finished as the game’s leading rusher with 117 rushing yards on 18 carries. Minicucci completed 32 of his 50 pass attempts for a 64 percent completion percentage. Kyre Duplessis caught six of those passes and finished with 90 yards leading all pass catchers. UD’s running game contributed a total of 34 yards.   
The Blue Hens will have a week to regroup before welcoming Middle Tennessee into Delaware Stadium Wednesday, October 22. The Blue Raiders are 0-2 in conference play this season and sit three spots below UD in the CUSA standings in 11th place.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Gemini_Generated_Image_tae3kttae3kttae3.png,,,2025-10-16 10:04:17.682684

(Photo by Anna Kaminsk/Kansas Reflector)OLATHE — Two women said they regretted their abortion procedures as they testified Wednesday during the second leg of a trial challenging state laws that impose requirements on abortion providers and patients.
However, the women’s abortions took place before the restrictions at the center of the case were in effect. And one woman did not receive any abortions in the state of Kansas.
The case in Johnson County District Court has been decades in the making, beginning in 1997 when Kansas lawmakers initially passed the Woman’s Right to Know Act. It contained a series of requirements relating to informed consent and steps abortion providers must take before performing an abortion. Republican legislators have built upon the act in the years since.
Melissa Cole, a retiree who lives in Tulsa but grew up in Overland Park, spoke about her three abortions. She obtained the first at 15 years old in 1974 in Missouri. The others took place in Arkansas and Texas. Donna Pond, a retired bookkeeper originally from Winfield, detailed her abortion, which took place in 1986 in Wichita when she was 16 years old.
“You can’t go back once you’ve made that decision,” Cole said. “You can’t go back.”
The trial resumed Tuesday after a multi-week break. The first part, in late September, began with two OB-GYNs whose businesses brought the suit against Kansas officials. The Center for Reproductive Rights, an international legal advocacy organization, is representing Traci Lynn Nauser, an Overland Park OB-GYN, and Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains. They sued Kansas officials in 2023 over the Woman’s Right to Know Act and tacked onto the lawsuit the following year a newer law that was passed as House Bill 2749.
The plaintiffs concluded witness testimony Tuesday with an ethicist and a historian on the stand. Wednesday was the state’s first opportunity to present witnesses.
The state is represented by attorneys from the conservative Christian legal advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom, along with former Kansas appeals judge and current solicitor general Anthony Powell.
In the decades since Cole underwent her procedures, she said, she has changed her mind about abortion. It was a change fueled by her Christian faith. She said she believes abortion should be illegal in all circumstances, including in cases of rape and incest, and she likened abortion to murder throughout her testimony.
The 66-year-old said she never discussed her abortions before the trial, save for a faith-based abortion recovery group.
“You never forget,” she said.
Monique Chireau Wubbenhorst is an OB-GYN with decades of experience as an academic and doctor, domestically and internationally. She also frequently testifies in abortion-related cases. She said her going rate is $800 an hour, and she has contributed to abortion-related cases in at least eight other states — most recently a deposition in Missouri earlier this month.
Wubbenhorst said she believes the Woman’s Right to Know Act “serves to protect the health of women and children.” Collecting data on a patient’s reasons for abortion, which is a provision of the 2024 legislation, “has public health significance and is helpful in public health activities,” she said.
As she unpacked a litany of studies and research related to abortions, Wubbenhorst and attorneys on both sides drilled into granular issues, including whether a fetus is a human or a collection of cells. Wubbenhorst was specific about her terminology. To her, she said it was important to distinguish between “intentional feticide,” referring to elective abortions, and “termination of pregnancy,” an abortion performed to save the life of a mother.
The 2024 law, which a court blocked before it could take effect, required providers to tell patients that abortions can be reversed, which is not widely accepted as safe, and to ask patients why they sought an abortion, offering a list of around a dozen reasons. The original right to know law mandates abortion providers use state-sanctioned abortion language, implement 30-minute wait periods before receiving an abortion, and print materials in a specific typeface on a particular color of paper.
While the plaintiffs have argued that Kansas’ restrictions threaten patient health and safety, the state’s attorneys attempted to show that the state laws do not cause harm to patients.
The case is scheduled to continue through Friday.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/250926_abortiontrial_p03-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-16 10:04:17.682684

While the Trump administration and Montana’s elected officials continue pushing to expand the state’s coal industry, companies on the ground appear to have a waning appetite. 
The federal government recently rejected a bid on a new coal lease offered for 167 million tons of coal from Montana’s Powder River Basin and postponed a sale in Wyoming scheduled for last week. 
Navajo Transitional Energy Company was the only company to submit a bid for the lease in Montana for $186,000 for federal coal near the company’s Spring Creek Mine in Big Horn County. That works out to just a fraction of a penny per ton, and well below what the Bureau of Land Management estimates as the market value. 
The last federal coal lease sale in the region went for $1.10 per ton, according to federal data, for a total of $793 million for 721 million tons, back in 2012. At the same price, a bid for the Spring Creek lease would generate more than $183 million.  
Navajo Transitional Energy operates the Spring Creek Mine in the area, which the federal government approved for expansion earlier this year, allowing access to an additional 39.9 million tons of coal, which could keep the mine operational for up to 16 more years. 
Wyofile previously reported that Navajo Transitional had warned that market value for coal in the Powder River Basin was far below previous valuations, and in documents submitted before the bid said that one reason included low forecasts for selling the coal, as many coal-fired power plants in the region are set to go offline in the next two decades. 
The Bureau of Land Management rejected NTEC’s offer for the Spring Creek lease, saying it did not meet the requirements of the federal Minerals Leasing Act, which requires a fair-market value for any federal lease. 
In an email, a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior said the BLM determines fair market value through “a rigorous process that includes economic modeling, analysis of comparable sales, and current market conditions to ensure taxpayers receive a fair return.”
“The BLM remains committed to supporting responsible coal development as part of a balanced approach to managing public lands and resources,” the department said. 
Funds from federal coal leases are split between the federal government and the state where the coal is mined, but part of the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill” lowered the federal coal royalty rate from 12.8% to 7%, decreasing how much money Montana is set to earn from each lease. 
The low offer for the Spring Creek lease prompted BLM to postpone another auction on a 441 million ton West Antelope III federal lease in Wyoming. Navajo Transitional also requested the sale in association with its Antelope coal mine, and was reportedly the only party interested in bidding. 
“While we had hoped for stronger participation, the postponed West Antelope III coal lease sale in Wyoming underscores the lasting damage from the Obama-Biden administration’s decades-long war on coal, which aimed to dismantle domestic production and shake investor confidence in the industry,” an Interior spokesperson wrote in an email. “Under President Trump, the Department of the Interior and BLM are restoring trust between government and industry as part of the broader push for American Energy Dominance.”
The West Antelope III sale has yet to be rescheduled. 
 Mining for Montana’s benefit

The low interest in coal leases comes as the Trump administration and Congress, with the support of all four members of Montana’s delegation have moved to greatly expand the potential offerings across the West. 
Last year, the Biden administration had announced that it would be halting much coal leasing in eastern Montana, and had made steps toward stopping coal leasing on federal tracts of land due to concerns about climate change.
But just last week, the U.S. Senate voted to roll back the Biden-era Resource Management Plan (RMP) amendment for the Miles City BLM office, spanning most of eastern Montana, which had prohibited future coal leases in the region. The U.S. House voted in favor of the amendment in September, with both of Montana’s representatives joining the Republican majority. 
“Montana energy is back,” Sen. Steve Daines said in a press release. “Mining is a vital part of Montana, providing nearly a thousand well-paying jobs and contributing nearly $3 billion to our state’s economy. That’s why I introduced a bill along with the rest of our Montana delegation to remove this anti-energy rule and support Montana’s coal miners.”
Daines did not respond to questions about the low interest in the recent coal lease or how increasing potential supply could further impact the market and Montana’s financial coffers. 
Montana’s Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte had also supported reopening eastern Montana for coal leasing, saying it was essential to the state’s economy and revenue. Montana supplies 5% of the nation’s coal and derives 37% of energy generation from coal-fired power plants.  
“Under the Biden Administration, BLM’s proposal would have rendered Montana’s coal resources useless, depriving Montana schools and other institutions of a critical funding source,” Gianforte wrote in a letter to the Trump administration. “Montana’s schools and public institutions need a good partner in BLM, and it is imperative that the agency embrace the opportunity to maximize the development opportunities for coal resources in Montana.”
Gianforte’s office did not respond to questions about the low interest in the recent coal lease or how increasing potential supply could further impact the market for Montana coal and the state’s financial benefit. 
Conservation groups decried the move by Congress to overturn the resource management plan, saying that it came about through a multi-year public process, but was revoked through a single vote. 
“It’s an egregious example of rich politicians thinking they know better than locals and experts. By legislating day-to-day management, Congress is hijacking careful planning and stewardship developed by local communities and experts,” said Alex Blackmer, with Wild Montana. “This reckless move puts not just one plan, but hundreds of land plans nationwide at risk of Congressional interference, unleashing chaos and uncertainty on ranchers, hunters, hikers, anglers, and businesses that depend on our public lands.”
Additional resource management plans from the Biden administration that banned future coal leasing, including in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin, are also being challenged in Congress. 
In Montana, Gianforte has continued to push for expanding energy production in the state, most recently by convening an energy task force to “unleash American-made energy,” following Trump’s executive orders to bolster nationwide domestic fossil fuel energy sources.

A New Mexico agency announced Wednesday that business owners struggling to secure adequate insurance due to recent wildfires can now receive up to $2 million in coverage from the state’s Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan. 
The FAIR Plan operates as the insurer of “last resort” in the state, offering coverage only to those unable to secure coverage in the private insurance market due to natural disasters. Until recently, the plan offered only $1 million in commercial coverage. 
Across the state, homeowner and other property insurance premiums have sharply increased, and insurers have refused to renew or even canceled policies in some areas, particularly the burn scars of the recent South Fork, Salt and Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon fires.
As a result, the Office of the Superintendent of Insurance earlier this summer approved increases of residential insurance coverage in the plan from $350,000 to $750,000.

“Now, we are taking another positive step forward by increasing FAIR Plan coverages for commercial properties by $1 million,” New Mexico Insurance Superintendent Alice Kane said in a news release.
Currently, 7,200 residents use the FAIR plan statewide, and so do 280 businesses, according to the news release. 
“I look forward to the benefits this will provide to business owners who have been impacted by wildfires, especially as many commercial property owners continue to face non-renewals and cancellations,” Kane said. 
Lawmakers sought even bigger coverage increases during the legislative session earlier this year through a bill that would have increased commercial limits to $5 million and required changes to the industry board that approves coverage increases. The bill died after the FAIR Plan board agreed to the increases taking place now, according to sponsor Harlan Vincent (R-Ruidoso Downs).
During the session, an OSI actuary that the 10 biggest insurers in the state have increased premiums on average 50% to 60% since 2022, though the actuary did not specify how much of that increase fell on homeowners or business owners. 
Along with the coverage increase, the OSI asked residents in high-wildfire-risk areas to mitigate risk around their properties.

(Photo courtesy of Prairie Island Indian Community)The effort by Minnesota’s Indigenous communities to achieve energy sovereignty is gathering pace. 
In the shadow of Xcel Energy’s Prairie Island nuclear power plant, the Prairie Island Indian Community now generates much of its electricity from onsite solar installations. 
Near the headwaters of the Mississippi, the White Earth Nation oversees one of the country’s only tribal utility commissions, giving it real leverage over local, non-Native utilities. 
The Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe is arguably the most important customer of — and a key decision-making authority for — Minnesota’s third biggest rural electric cooperative.
The tribes seeking energy sovereignty face a stiff challenge, however, in the Trump administration’s campaign to roll back clean energy progress, as well as the White House’s apparent disregard for Indigenous communities. 
Still, the work goes on: Bob Blake, a member of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa and owner of a Minneapolis energy development company, helped secure a pre-Trump federal grant to set up a “tribal virtual utility” on the Red Lake Reservation in far northern Minnesota. He retained a blue-chip “tax and assurance firm” to lay the legal groundwork for a new electric provider in a strictly regulated state where utility territories are set more or less in stone. The utility would purchase cheap, renewable power and deliver it to customers without spending huge sums on its own power plants.
The long-term goal is something resembling Yakama Power, a tribal utility that steadily absorbed small electric co-ops over the past two decades and now serves thousands of people across rural Washington State. There’s no reason the Minnesota utility couldn’t serve multiple tribal nations across the state and perhaps beyond, Blake said in an interview. 
“What I eventually see is tribal nations coming together, forming their own electrical associations and then selling power on the grid like the big guys,” he said.
Eventually. The virtual utility idea is on hold due in part to the Trump administration’s cut of $7 billion in funding for the Biden-era Solar For All program, which subsidizes renewable energy deployment in low-income and historically marginalized communities. As litigation drags on, Blake said up to $80 million in funding that could have gone to Red Lake is in limbo. 
“We have a lot of time to plan now,” he said. “These opportunities will present themselves again and we will be that much more ready to move forward when they do.”

Rural utilities come around
Minnesota tribes aren’t waiting on Blake’s ambitious vision to reshape the state’s energy landscape. 
In 2022, as Enbridge routed its controversial Line 3 oil pipeline near its reservation, the White Earth Nation stood up a tribal utility commission with the ability to set rates, permit infrastructure and issue legally binding orders to the electric, gas and telecommunications utilities serving its 1,100 square-mile territory. It’s among the few commissions like it nationwide.
“The community came out and said, ‘We want to be in control if that happens again, that anyone who wants to build infrastructure through our reservation needs to get a permit for it,’” Nate Matthews, the commission’s executive director, said on the panel at the recent Minnesota Solar Energy Industries Association’s annual conference. He sat alongside Matt Dannenberg, head of tribal affairs for the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy.
The tribal utility commission also gives White Earth more pull with the four retail electric utilities serving its members in northwestern Minnesota. Rates can vary wildly across relatively short distances on the reservation, Matthews said, leaving some members wondering why they pay twice as much for electricity as their neighbors. The commission recently wrapped up work on a net metering policy requiring the utilities to compensate members fairly for electricity produced by solar arrays and other small, customer-sited power sources.
Also under the commission’s jurisdiction are larger power projects that will give White Earth some measure of energy independence. 
The tribe is nearing construction of a $2.8 million solar array that Matthews said could supply two-thirds of the power consumed by its Shooting Star Casino in Bagley, Minnesota. Though it promises to eat into regional transmission co-op Minnkota Power’s sales, Matthews said the utility indicated they won’t push back on the project.
White Earth began construction this year on a smaller but more complicated “resilience hub” at an elementary school and community center in the village of Pine Point. That project — developed by locally owned 8th Fire Solar and 10Power out of California — expands a small existing solar array and adds enough batteries to power critical loads at the facilities for up to 12 hours. It’s engineered as a self-contained microgrid that can disconnect from the public grid during outages.
Resilience is a common goal in tribal communities, said Gwe Gasco, director of sales and marketing for 8th Fire Solar. 8th Fire’s core business is producing and installing solar thermal panels that — unlike more common solar photovoltaic panels — convert the sun’s energy directly into heat. 
Solar thermal systems can’t entirely replace gas, propane or electric building heat, but they can significantly reduce winter heating loads and cut users’ energy bills, Gasco said. One or two panels is enough for most residential and small commercial sites. Though 8th Fire can handle larger projects like an eight-panel installation at a planned Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe resilience hub in South Dakota, Gasco said much of its business comes from people looking to wrest some control over their energy bills back from utilities. 
“People are getting fed up with what’s going on…they’re realizing they can do a lot of this stuff ourselves,” he said. 
Like Minnkota in Bagley, Matthews said the regional transmission utility for Pine Point, Great River Energy, is on board with that project. So is Itasca-Mantrap Cooperative Electric Association, which operates the lower-voltage distribution network serving individual customers in the area.
“The new leadership and younger folks at Great River Energy…instead of closing the drawbridge, they’ve been really excited to work with us on this,” he said. 
Steve Johnson, Itasca-Mantrap president and CEO, said in an email that the scale of the Pine Point project — which he called “an inspiring, community-driven effort” — required careful study before getting the go-ahead to connect to the grid. But he suggested the utility and the tribe are aligned on energy strategy in their remote corner of Minnesota.
“We understand the deep challenges facing rural communities, from rising energy costs to increasingly frequent and severe storms, and we share the goal of building a stronger, more resilient, and equitable energy future,” he said.
Matthews said the utility commission is considering a utility franchise fee that could fund future projects like Pine Point and Shooting Star, plus service line extensions, hookup fees and other costs normally borne by customers. 
Dannenberg, a member of Wisconsin’s Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, said that the White Earth Tribal Utility Commission’s work puts it on the leading edge of the Indigenous energy sovereignty movement in the United States. He characterized it as a small step “to right the historical injustices” of a power system that has treated tribes as an afterthought.
“This is recent history where tribes are asserting their sovereignty in the energy space…saying, we’re fed up with blackouts, brownouts and not getting the energy services we deserve,” he said.
Big enough to matter 
With its self-generation and resilience projects, White Earth Nation is following a path blazed by Minnesota Indigenous communities like the Mille Lacs Band and Prairie Island Indian Community.
In 2022, the Mille Lacs Band commissioned a 3-megawatt solar array in Hinckley. The system ties into the East Central Energy grid but offsets a substantial amount of electric demand from the tribe, which runs Grand Casino Mille Lacs and Grand Casino Hinckley.
The tribe’s initial vision “turned out to be beyond the scope of what was possible from an engineering standpoint. We said, ‘Let’s put away the legal stuff and diagrams and tell us what you want,” said Justin Jahnz, ECE president and CEO. 
That turned out to be pretty simple: a sizable solar system that reduced the tribe’s carbon footprint and gave it some energy independence. As the partnership deepened, ECE invested in grid resilience efforts that would directly benefit the tribe, further boosting its energy independence. Mille Lacs has long been part of ECE’s member resource council, Jahnz said, in recognition of their importance as a major customer.
The Prairie Island Indian Community and Dakota Electric Association — the state’s second largest electric distribution cooperative — have a similarly close working relationship, Dakota Electric CEO Ryan Hentges said in an email. 
Hentges said that since 2000 or so, the cooperative has worked with the community on major projects like a full backup generation system for the entire Treasure Island Resort and Casino campus; new infrastructure to improve local power quality; and — most meaningfully for the community’s energy sovereignty and climate goals — the development of a 5.4-megawatt solar array and a separate geothermal heating and cooling system at the casino.
The solar and geothermal systems are part of the first tranche of projects in the Prairie Island Indian Community’s net zero initiative, Andrea Zimmerman, the tribe’s energy program manager, said in an interview. So is a community-wide energy upgrade initiative underway now that will significantly improve the efficiency of its aging housing stock.
A second tranche will bolster weatherization, upgrade commercial buildings across the community and potentially roll out an electric vehicle fleet, Zimmerman said.
The budget President Trump signed in July could make those next projects harder to underwrite, however. Alongside the widely-panned health care cuts Washington Democrats are fighting to undo, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act drastically shortened the window for owners and developers of wind and solar energy projects to qualify for generous federal tax credits that under Biden-era legislation would have remained in effect into the mid-2030s.
The cuts are forcing Prairie Island Indian Community to change their approach and consider other funding strategies, Zimmerman said.
Dannenberg said the Trump administration’s cuts to Solar for All affected some of the projects supported by the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy, too. For now, his group — which provides technical assistance and project finance for tribal energy projects — is simply trying to do as much as it can before the tax credits expire next year.
“The name of the game now is how many Solar For All projects can we salvage and get across the finish line,” he said.
But the Trump administration’s heel turn from Biden-era energy policy so far hasn’t knocked Minnesota off its clean energy goals. The state aims for a carbon-free power grid by 2040 and a net-zero economy by 2050. 
It sees tribes as vital to those efforts. In 2023, the Legislature established the Tribal Advisory Council on Energy, the first state-funded body giving tribes an official voice on state energy policy. Prairie Island Tribal Council Member Michael Childs Jr. is a TACE co-chair.
Blake, who pushed the Legislature to create TACE, said in January that tribes’ political sovereignty makes them critical partners in transforming Minnesota’s energy economy.
“Native people are the only people with their own government in this government,” he said. “In regard to the energy transition, if we aren’t giving Tribes the opportunity and chance to collaborate, they will never reach their potential.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/solar-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-16 11:03:44.560818

For many young Californians, preschool is a place to run around, sing songs and develop early social skills. But for those enrolled in one San Diego program, preschool could also mean speaking to a mental health therapist, processing trauma and learning emotional regulation.
As CalMatters’ Adriana Heldiz explains in a visual essay, Mi Escuelita is a preschool dedicated to students who have experienced family trauma, including domestic violence. Last year, 28 parents of 84 students enrolled in Mi Escuelita reported having been involved in multiple domestic violence relationships.
The school offers students on-site mental health services, such as one-on-one sessions with clinicians, as well as group therapy where students learn about feelings and how to regulate them. Therapists interact with students through play, and keep an eye out for clues of deeper emotional issues bubbling up.

Angelina Puffelis, clinical supervisor at Mi Escuelita: “Usually there is a theme and some of the things that are common are protection, safety, empowerment or the superhero; bad and evil. So as a therapist, I look for that. This is a continuum theme and if there’s changes in the home environment, that theme plays out in play therapy.”

Though the cost of operating Mi Escuelita is $1.3 million a year, students attend Mi Escuelita for free and classes are offered year-round. Founded in 2006, Mi Escuelita is regarded as a leader among therapeutic preschools, offering insight to the benefits of a trauma-informed learning environment. A recent UC San Diego report found that 82% of Mi Escuelita students scored above average on the Kindergarten Readiness Test — meaning those students have “no major learning difficulties.”

Inaccurate directories haunt patients

After being diagnosed with a hernia that occurs through an opening in the diaphragm — a potentially fatal condition that requires surgery — Mary Kuhn began searching for an in-network specialist who could treat her. But discrepancies arising from her health insurance’s “ghost network” underscores how Kuhn, and many patients like her, experience delays in care that could endanger their lives, writes CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.
So-called ghost networks refer to inaccurate or outdated lists published by insurance companies that include health providers who aren’t actually in-network. For Kuhn, her physician referred her to a Walnut Creek cardiothoracic surgeon listed in Blue Shield of California’s online directory of providers. But a month before her surgery was to take place, the insurer sent her a denial letter in December 2024, refusing to pay for the surgeon’s services, stating the doctor was not in her health plan.

Kuhn: “I thought that’s a mistake. Of course he’s in-network, I see him there.”

Though California passed a law in 2015 to make it easier for patients to find in-network care, patients still struggle with inaccurate directories. Assemblymember Cecilia Aguiar-Curry argues that the law is underenforced, and that health plans have “no incentive” to fix the problem. Though the Davis Democrat introduced a bill to require directories to be 95% accurate by 2029, she later withdrew it, and says she plans to revive the measure next year.

Former physician seeks to unseat Republican

Former Democratic state Sen. Richard Pan is running to unseat U.S. Rep. Kevin Kiley, a Republican who finds himself newly vulnerable should voters pass Proposition 50 in November, writes CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
Pan said he is running for congress because he wants to make the government “work for people” again. The Sacramento physician successfully pushed for a 2015 state law requiring stronger immunization protections for children, and faced immense pushback from anti-vaccine activists and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the current U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary.

Pan, in an interview with CalMatters: “We see a federal government that seems to be intentionally attacking health care, whether it’s taking away people’s health insurance, undermining public health to allow disease to spread, cutting research for things like cancer treatments.”

Since 2023, Kiley has represented California’s 3rd Congressional District. Kiley is an outspoken critic of Gov. Gavin Newsom and opposes Prop. 50. If the district changes under the measure, Pan would have previously represented about 70% of voters who live in that new district, according to his campaign.

And lastly: A hole in the theory

On Monday California Secretary of State Shirley Weber addressed the growing conspiracy theory that a small hole on the ballot return envelopes for November’s special election was designed to reveal a person’s vote on Prop. 50 — the only measure on the ballot. 
Weber said the hole is for “sight-impaired voters to orient themselves” when they sign the envelope. If voters have privacy concerns, they can place their ballots inside the envelope in a way that does not make their markings visible, or vote in person. Similar theories spread during Newsom’s recall election in 2021.






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Despite Newsom pledging to lead efforts to develop millions of new housing units, and signing multiple bills to speed up construction, housing production in California did not substantially increase during his governorship.
Acts of protest from detained immigrants — such as the hunger strikes in California’s El Centro Immigration Detention Facility — have never stopped, and will likely continue under President Donald Trump’s second administration, writes Jessica Ordaz, associate professor of ethnic studies at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Mi Escuelita now has a long record of helping kids and families move forward.","Elizabeth Gibot’s son James was normally a quiet and well-behaved toddler. But she noticed he began to cry more and appeared anxious whenever she wasn’t around. He also stopped using the sign language she taught him as a baby. She knew something was wrong, so she reached out to their pediatrician, but the doctor couldn’t provide any help or answers.
“He regressed from everything that I had taught him,” she said. “I guess it was very hard for other people to notice because nobody knows your child more than you.”
At the time, Gibot had just left her partner, who she said was physically, verbally, emotionally and financially abusive. She tried to shield James when things got confrontational, but living in a small house made it unavoidable at times.
Gibot began searching for resources online. She stumbled upon Mi Escuelita, a preschool in San Diego dedicated to students who have experienced family trauma, such as domestic violence. After some thought, she enrolled James. 
“Just that alone was a huge weight off my shoulders, knowing that he’s going to be here and with professionals that are going to help him, in ways that I could never. I mean, at least not in that moment in time,” she said. 



Elizabeth Gibot and her son James Gibot received mental health services offered to Mi Escuelita students and their families.
Mi Escuelita, founded in 2006, offers students on-site mental health services and a safe space where children can learn and heal. It’s considered a leader among therapeutic preschools, and it offers insight to the emerging concept of a trauma-informed learning environment for students and their families.
Run by the nonprofit SBCS, formerly known as South Bay Community Services, the school has long provided services to families in need, including those experiencing domestic violence. Mi Escuelita grew out of those programs.  
“It’s to really focus on the little guys,” said Stacey Musso, director of the behavioral health and wellness department at SBCS.  
In addition to making sure students are ready for kindergarten, Mi Escuelita offers one-on-one and group therapy. It has on-site therapists accessible to students during school hours. Angelina Puffelis, clinical supervisor at Mi Escuelita, says the access provides her team an opportunity to work with students and address issues as they bubble up.

Last: Behavioral Specialist Sebastian Lavenant works with a student during class at Mi Escuelita in San Diego on April 23, 2025. The preschool has eight teachers, two on-site therapists and a behavioral therapist on staff. While therapists mainly focus on the mental health of a student, behavioral therapists center on examining the actions and conduct of a student to see what may be triggering them or getting in the way of them interacting with others.
Students wash their hands after a painting activity at Mi Escuelita in San Diego on April 23, 2025. Many of the students at the preschool are students of color and come from low-income families. Mi Escuelita offers mental health services to both students and their families since those relationships play a role in a child’s development.
According to a recent report, 28 parents of students enrolled at Mi Escuelita last year reported having been involved in multiple domestic violence relationships. Seventeen of them had to move or were homeless as a result of domestic violence. 
Evidence shows the program works.
A recent UC San Diego report found 82% of students at Mi Escuelita scored above average on the Kindergarten Readiness Test, which evaluates a student’s preparation for kindergarten. An  above-average score indicates a student should need “very little special attention and with no major learning difficulties.”
Students attend Mi Escuelita at no cost, and classes are offered year-round. In return, families agree to work with school officials to address mental health issues head on.
“We ask that our families understand our environment. It is so unique,” said Mi Escuelita preschool director Lisa Klemp. “We really believe in that connection. We want to support not just our children, but our family as a whole.”
Students take part in a safari hunt at Mi Escuelita on April 23, 2025. All children who attend Mi Escuelita have experienced family-related trauma in their short lives.
Lessons from nap time
As a handful of students savored the last bites of their sandwiches, carrots and apple sauce during a recent lunch, others prepared for their next activity. They threw away trash, grabbed blankets and lay on mats set throughout the classroom. Some students grabbed stuffed animals or picked out books to keep them comfortable. Teachers dimmed the lights and played a Youtube video of kittens purring as lullabies played softly. 


While most students quickly fell asleep, some struggled to relax. One girl refused to sleep and cried when told she couldn’t run around the classroom. Teachers tried to help by offering to read her books or by blowing small bubbles, but she wasn’t having it. Another girl lay very still with her eyes wide open looking straight at the ceiling. She barely blinked and stayed this way for most of nap time before finally dozing off.
“We do see that resting their bodies, the calming, can be challenging for some of our kids,” Klemp said. “I believe that they’ve been in spaces or environments that may have caused them to be hyper alert. And so knowing that you’re in a safe space, that you can calm and relax your body is really crucial for some of them.”
Teacher Ismairy Caldera reads to a student to help them fall asleep during nap time at Mi Escuelita in San Diego on May 5, 2025. Nap time can be particularly challenging for children who have experienced trauma, as many of them remain on high alert and struggle to rest.

According to the National Survey of Children’s Health, 63% of U.S. adults reported experiencing at least one so-called adverse childhood experience before age 18, such as abuse, witnessing violence or family separation. Trauma can show up in different ways. Some may become explosive in their behavior while others may be timid or seclude themselves. Nap time, in particular, can be a challenge for younger children.
“In general, as a kid, at night can be a scary place. And then if you’re hearing screaming, if you’re hearing someone slamming a door, if you’re hearing someone, you know, police showing up in your home, it just really emphasizes that scary time,” Klemp said. 
Trauma in children can go untreated or be dismissed as normal behavior but its impacts can have a lasting effect that can lead to substance abuse, eating disorders, diabetes and heart disease, according to the National Child Traumatic Stress Network. Early trauma can also increase the potential of being involved in the juvenile justice system and low academic performance.

Since it can be difficult for children to express their emotions, Puffelis uses play therapy as a way to help her understand what a child might be experiencing. “It’s like being in a tour,” she said. “And for me, the child will be the tour guide. I will listen, I will follow, but if I have a question, I will probe and get information.”

At Mi Escuelita, every student participates in individual therapy sessions with clinicians. Therapy with a child can look different than a session with an adult. Rather than sitting and talking about feelings, therapists at Mi Escuelita play with the students and patiently look for clues or signs of deeper emotions. 
“Usually there is a theme and some of the things that are common are protection, safety, empowerment or the superhero; bad and evil,”  said Puffelis. “So as a therapist, I look for that. This is a continuum theme and if there’s changes in the home environment, that theme plays out in play therapy.”


In between those one-on-one sessions, therapists lead small group sessions where they teach aspects of a program called Incredible Years that helps students learn about feelings and how they can regulate them. These sessions can involve activities such as reading books, discussing different types of feelings or using puppets to act out a scenario that may help unlock emotions. 
Wally, a puppet with curly black hair, is part of the program. He has a special place in the school’s annual graduation ceremonies. Every year, a member of the school staff holds the puppet so it can “walk” with the kids.
Therapist Spencer Mattox reads a book to students during a small group therapy session at Mi Escuelita in San Diego on May 20, 2025.
The book centers around a young girl who gets upset and how she is able to find ways to manage her anger.
Generations of domestic violence
Gibot has experienced domestic violence throughout her life. Growing up, she saw her parents and other family members deal with the same issues. 
At Mi Escuelita, Gibot benefitted from some of the mental health services offered to families of students. She received therapy and attended parent engagement meetings where she learned tips on how to support James, such as using physical touch to regulate his body and using more words of affirmation to build his self-esteem. 
Within six months, Gibot began to notice improvements in his behavior. She said she wishes more schools were set up like Mi Escuelita to spare families red tape and having to navigate through a variety of specialists at different locations. 
“Ideally, the norm should be like Mi Escuelita, especially since there’s so many kids who could benefit from it,” she said.
Teacher Viviana Vasquez works with students during class at Mi Escuelita in San Diego on April 23, 2025. All staff at Mi Escuelita are required to complete a 40-hour training offered by SBCS to help equip them with the knowledge and skills needed to support survivors of domestic violence, such as learning how it can affect children.
What happens after Mi Escuelita?
When students leave Mi Escuelita, they enter school districts that may offer some mental health services or intervention, but usually not as hands-on as they are used to. If a teacher or staff member believes a student may be dealing with mental health related issues, they can recommend that the student see a school counselor or social worker. From there, school officials can refer the family of the student to outside health providers offered by community organizations or local county health services.


Hilaria Bauer, chief early learning services officer at the Bay Area nonprofit early learning organization Kidango, said other educators are beginning to embrace concepts from Mi Escuelita’s approach, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic.
“As we came back to classrooms and to more regular types of activities, you begin to see how that isolation, that trauma affected our families and the children,” she said.
But building the unique learning environment SBCS created at Mi Escuelita may be challenging to replicate. 
“It’s such a wonderful idea and it’s such a powerful idea. I’m assuming it’s also a very expensive idea,” said Bauer. 





Students participate in a graduation ceremony at Mi Escuelita in San Diego on June 11, 2025. 
The cost of operating Mi Escuelita is $1.3 million each year; it’s funded by a mix of local, state and federal sources, as well as private donors, according to SBCS. 
On top of funding, Bauer says finding the right staffing is another hurdle to take into consideration. For instance, it can be difficult to find teachers who have the required license to provide therapy in addition to having classroom experience.  
Still, Bauer says policymakers can benefit in the long run from implementing certain concepts offered at Mi Escuelita. Research seems to back her assessment. Another UC San Diego study, which tracked the performance of students over several years, showed those who attended Mi Escuelita tended to score at the same level or sometimes higher in math, reading and writing compared to other students in the Chula Vista Elementary School District.
“We can spend less later on intervention programs and alternative facilities,” Bauer said. “There will be less truancy, less big behaviors or expulsions or alternative programs, and all of those ‘fix’ initiatives if we really focus on the time in the life of a child that really makes a change.”
Students perform a song during a graduation ceremony at Mi Escuelita in San Diego on June 11, 2025. 
James started kindergarten in August and celebrated his birthday in September. He’s doing well, Gibot said.
As he prepared for kindergarten, Gibot said she worried about what might happen. Klemp assured her that she and James would continue to receive support from SBCS. That made her feel more confident. 
“He’s learned a lot and gained skills that I wish I was able to teach him. But you know, we both learned,” she said.
James was one of the students who graduated from Mi Escuelita in May. Gibot, sitting with the rest of the attendees at the ceremony, watched as her son performed songs with his fellow classmates, cheered for his friends and received a small diploma.
“It was just really emotional for me. I’m like ‘Wow. He’s not scared. He’s not feeling all these different emotions,’” she said. “He just did it all by himself. And just seeing that independence grow, it’s just beautiful.”

Gavin Newsom signed a law requiring lawmakers to disclose when they’ve gotten a new job. Will it uncover corruption?","In summary
After a CalMatters report, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law requiring lawmakers to disclose when they’ve gotten a new job. Will it uncover corruption?


California’s elected and appointed officials will now have to tell the public when they’ve accepted a job offer from a new employer that might seek favors from them while they’re still in a position of power.
Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier this month signed Assembly Bill 1286 by Democratic Assemblymember Tasha Boerner of Solana Beach. The measure requires California’s elected officials and state appointees to note on mandatory conflict of interest forms whether they’ve gotten a new job before their term in office ends.
Boerner introduced the measure in response to a CalMatters story last year that highlighted how lawmakers were not required to tell the public if they were negotiating or had accepted a job with an organization trying to get something from the Legislature. 
“People’s distrust of the government is growing,” Boerner said in a statement after the bill was presented to Newsom. “As public servants, one of the most important parts of our job is transparency. It is the one-way ticket to building confidence between government officials and their communities.”
Shery Yang, a spokesperson for the California Fair Political Practices Commission, which enforces California’s ethics laws, said Chairperson Adam Silver proposed the bill idea to Boerner’s office after reading CalMatters’ story. 
Under the new law, officials must now provide the commission with the date they accept a job offer, the position they’re going to take and a description of what their employer does, as well as their employer’s name and address. Boerner’s bill passed the Legislature without any lawmaker voting against it. 
The CalMatters report came as around a quarter of the Legislature was leaving office. Some lawmakers were searching for their next job while still casting votes, potentially on matters that could benefit their future employers. 
Of the 180 lawmakers who left office since 2012, the story noted, around 40 registered as lobbyists, worked as political consultants or took executive-level jobs with companies or organizations actively lobbying at the Capitol.

It’s illegal and considered bribery for a government official to cast votes or do other official favors in exchange for a promise of future employment. It’s also illegal for officials to use state resources to search for or secure a new job.
Lawmakers also are supposed to recuse themselves from any official actions that have “direct and significant” financial impact on an entity with whom they are negotiating employment or who has made them an employment offer,” according to a legislative ethics committee handout.
But state ethics guidelines still allow lawmakers to vote on bills that could benefit a prospective employer, allowing them to discuss and vote on bills that would benefit a “significant segment” of an industry rather than their specific would-be employer.
In practice, that means a lawmaker with a job pending at a major tech company can continue to vote on legislation that impacts all tech companies.
Government ethics experts told CalMatters last year that adding disclosure requirements for job-hunting lawmakers would add needed transparency and help keep lawmakers and lobbyists honest.
FPPC Chairperson Silver called the measure “an important step forward for transparency and accountability in the political process.”
“This reform is about something bigger than disclosure forms — it is about trust,” he said in a statement. “It guarantees that Californians know their government is working for them, not for private interests. And more practically, it ensures that the FPPC has the information necessary to timely and effectively identify and prosecute violations of the state’s ban on influencing prospective employment.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/091225_End-Of-Session_FG_27.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-16 08:56:50.382962

Jessica Ordaz
Jessica Ordaz is an associate professor of ethnic studies at the University of Colorado Boulder. She is the author of “The Shadow of El Centro: A History of Migrant Incarceration and Solidarity.”


I keep thinking about José René Flores, a Los Angeles resident incarcerated at a Southern California migrant detention facility in the 1980s. The El Centro Immigration Detention Facility, where immigration agents sent Flores, has a long and deep history of brutality. 
But Flores’ story is not just one of violence and violation. It is also a story of protest and solidarity — reflective of a larger lineage of resistance from inside detention, including the people the Trump administration is currently working to silence and disappear. They’ve risked their “rightless” lives with the hope that the world might learn about the inhumane conditions behind detention walls, and that they might be free. 
Flores migrated to the United States from El Salvador in 1980, after being attacked by members of his homeland’s National Guard, a paramilitary organization known for committing atrocities during the Salvadoran Civil War. As a teenager, he was targeted for his involvement in a factory trade union and for participating in the revolutionary organization Frente de Acción Popular Unificada.
“There was terrible repression in El Salvador,” Flores told me when I interviewed him several years ago. “I was criminalized for having long hair and black glasses. Just looking different and being young meant you were a criminal, marijuanero, guerillero and a drug addict.” 
When Flores arrived in Los Angeles, he was apprehended by Immigration and Naturalization Service officials, who transported him to El Centro, because he chose to apply for political asylum. The detention center, located in California’s Imperial Valley, was built to incarcerate unauthorized Mexican men and those convicted of deportable crimes in 1945. By the time Flores got there, it had evolved from a small camp into a large-scale facility with a deep history of labor exploitation, physical abuse and surveillance. 
INS officials forced Flores and his fellow detained migrants to work as low-paid and sometimes unpaid laborers, limited their access to low-nutrient food and medical care, and oversaw a climate of physical and psychological intimidation. 
Flores and a few other Salvadoran migrants decided to fight back. All of us felt the same, said Flores: “Offended. Mistreated. We wanted to tell each other not to be sad. That we were all in this together.”

In 1981, they began a 15-day hunger strike. Their refusal to eat and the use of their bodies to protest called out the violence of the state, making the public aware of the punitive nature of detention.
Due to the protest and the efforts of the immigrant aid group Concilio Manzo, the INS released Flores from the facility that same year. 
Soon after, in 1985, a much larger hunger strike at El Centro made international news. Fifteen migrants from around the world organized an eight-day hunger strike. Between 175 and 300 incarcerated men participated, demanding that their grievances be heard. 
While official INS accounts asserted that the detention center functioned simply as an administrative holding site where people waited for their deportation hearings, the stories the strikers shared with lawyers and the media framed the detention center as a site of punishment. 
The protestors also publicized an important factor missing from the INS narrative: why many Central Americans had migrated to the U.S. in the first place. A number of the protestors came because they had been persecuted in their home countries for fighting back against repressive Latin American regimes funded by U.S. tax dollars.
The 1985 strike resulted in further repression from INS officers. But it also helped shift the narrative around detention in the public eye, even as the U.S. continued to incarcerate immigrants and asylum seekers at sites such as the Krome Service Processing Center in Florida, the Port Isabel Detention Center in Texas, and Guantanamo Bay in Cuba under both Democratic and Republican administrations. 
Acts of protest from people behind detention walls have never stopped. In the coming decades, migrants have demanded that lawyers and immigrant rights organizations hear and document their stories, filed class action lawsuits, and staged acts of defiance, like refusing to eat or work to challenge the cruelty of the state. 
Dissent continues under “Trump’s Reign of Terror.” At the end of September, for instance, 19 incarcerated migrants commenced a hunger strike inside Louisiana’s Angola prison, Camp J, calling for basic standards of care, such as prescription medication, toilet paper and clean water. 
Such acts of resistance and refusal from the inside show that, despite carceral efforts to control, isolate, and strip migrants of their humanity, people will continue to find ways to fight back.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)With the “No Kings” rally returning this weekend bringing thousands out to protest President Donald Trump’s administration, Beth Osborne, an organizer with the grassroots movement Indivisible, expects bigger crowds in Las Vegas, as well as other cities across the country, than in the two demonstrations earlier this year. 
But one thing about the protest in Downtown Las Vegas will be the same: Demonstrators will again be kept off the streets themselves and confined to sidewalks, in part because of the high cost of permits.
Jacob Valentine, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Nevada, worried that high permitting costs are being put in place “to try to limit first amendment activity.”
“I think what the city needs to remember is that this is people’s First Amendment rights and their right to protest,” he said. “If they want to be involved and make sure those protests go a certain way they need to be more accommodating to people.”
Indivisible is organizing the “No Kings” rally, one of several taking place in Southern Nevada, Saturday at 11 a.m.  in front of the Federal Courthouse, the same location the rally took place in June.
In the last few months, Trump has sent National Guard to numerous U.S. cities, told military leaders that cities will be used as training grounds to combat “the invasion from within” and ordered the Department of Justice to prosecute political enemies. All these actions have pushed the country “so much past the line of fascism,” Osborne said.
“I think this is a defining moment in this country, the city and this world to ask which side of history are you going to be on?” she said.
Though they want to take to the streets to engage in their constitutional rights to protests, Osborne is aware that while the Vegas heat has cooled, political and cultural temperatures are especially high. 
To ensure a safe event, Osborne said Indivisible has had numerous conversations with Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and City of Las Vegas officials to ensure everything goes smoothly.
As they sought to get a permit and inquired about the costs to shut down the streets, which could limit some interactions with law enforcement and allow participants easier movement among and within the crowd, Osborne said they were told it would cost $20,000.
“It would have been great if we could have closed down the street,” she said. “The planning for that and the type of money that that takes is just not something a small grassroots group” can afford
When asked about the amount by Nevada Current, LVMPD said it wasn’t sure where the figure came from, and officials didn’t “recall giving number cost for staffing” to organizers, said Sergeant Jakob Shallenberger, a spokesman for LVMPD.
To obtain a basic permit without shutting down the street costs $265 according to Jace Radke, a spokesman for the City of Las Vegas. But that still restricts organizers to stay on the sidewalks. 
“If a street is being closed there will need to be a barricade plan ($50 city fee) and the organizers will have to pay the cost of the barricades through a barricade company,” Radke said. “The Metro Police Special Events team reviews all special event permit applications, and they determine if there are additional security needs.” 
Radke said the $20,000 figure didn’t come from the city. LVMPD said while it does coordinate with the city “I don’t know how the city calculates the cost of a permit or staffing needs,” Shallenberger said. 
Meanwhile, when it comes to being protest-friendly, Las Vegas is “better than some cities, but there is more work to be done,” said Valentine with the ACLU. 
“The city and law enforcement could always be doing a better job to accommodate First Amendment protestors,” he said.
At the last protest there were nearly 100 arrests, though the overwhelming majority were dropped. The ACLU of Nevada at the time said a majority of those arrested were for things like sitting on the sidewalk. 
LVMPD Sheriff Kevin McMahill told 8 News Now in a recent interview that most of the charges dropped were “partly our fault because there are so many people getting arrested in a chaotic situation.” He said the LVMPD is looking to resubmit evidence against those arrested seeking further legal action. 
“It’s telling that there were 90 citations at a protest and … less than five are going through and being tried,” Valentine said. “All the rest have been dismissed. I think it’s telling that there might be a need for the city to accommodate protests of this size.” 
In addition to legal observers, Indivisible recruits volunteer “safety marshals” to help ensure people stay on sidewalks and there are clear pathways for people to walk. The group also relies on “de-escalators that have been trained in very specific techniques of how to bring the temperature down,” Osborne said. 
“I think tensions are higher, certainly, and we’re doing everything we can to make sure that we create a safe event,” Osborne said. “We don’t want the police, you know, arresting people for exercising their First Amendment rights.”
In addition to the morning rally at the courthouse, there are eight “No Kings” events scheduled throughout the state:

10 a.m. in Henderson;
4:30 p.m. in front of New York New York on the Strip;
10 a.m. in Mesquite;
10 a.m. in Pahrump;
10 a.m. in Hawthorne;
8:30 a.m. in Carson City;
11 a.m. in Reno;
12 p.m. in Elko.

“What we need is 3.5% of the population to engage in mass noncooperation and civil disobedience. Those are the kind of things that topple dictators,” Osborne said, citing a figure from historians and political scientists who study civil resistance movements. “And we certainly got a dictator wannabe to be sitting in the White House.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC06785-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-16 08:56:50.382962
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-10-16 12:11:22+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,‘Contactless’ fares quickly grow popular among T riders,Chris Lisinski,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/transportation/contactless-fares-quickly-grow-popular-among-t-riders/,"MBTA riders long wanted the agency to catch up with its peers and provide a way to pay fares that didn’t involve CharlieCards or vending machines. After the first year, data show many commuters are embracing the new option.","IF YOU POLLED a full rush-hour train or bus across the MBTA system, odds are that at least one in four riders aboard would not have touched a CharlieCard in the past several months. 
It’s been a bit more than a year since the T rolled out the ability to tap a credit card or mobile wallet to get onto the core subway and bus systems, and the new system has quickly become popular with passengers. 
Through the first 12 months of the offering, the share of fares paid using the “contactless” system grew from less than 10 percent to more than 25 percent. That’s close to the same share as “stored value” taps, or when a rider puts a set dollar amount on a CharlieCard or CharlieTicket but does not buy a weekly or monthly pass. The remaining roughly 50 percent of trips involve those time-based passes or other options, such as T employees. 
 So in other words, by late spring, just about as many riders were turning to Apple Pay, Google Wallet and credit cards as were loading up their trusty old CharlieCards with a set dollar amount. 
MBTA leaders and watchdogs alike are pleased with the uptake so far, describing it as a sign of success for an initiative meant to modernize the system and cater to an increasingly digital public. 
“The approach that [MBTA General Manager] Phil Eng and his team are taking is much more reality-based and designed to meet people where they are, not where the T would like them to be,” said Brian Kane, executive director of the MBTA Advisory Board, which represents cities and towns who help fund the transit system. “The ability to use your phone or use a credit card is obviously ubiquitous in today’s society.” 
In August 2024, the first month with the new payment options live to all passengers, about 904,000 of the roughly 10.9 million taps on the MBTA came from so-called contactless sources such as mobile wallets.  Nearly 4.4 million taps that month involved what the T calls “stored value,” or a CharlieCard or CharlieTicket loaded with a set dollar amount rather than a weekly or monthly pass. 
Those two offerings have been on opposite trends since then. By July 2025, the most recent month with data available, about 3.17 million trips involved contactless taps, just a shade below the 3.26 million trips using stored value taps. 
T leaders think the added ease of payment has been one factor among several contributing to stronger fare collections. While the MBTA — like most other transit agencies around the country — continues to struggle with depleted ridership in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, it hauled in $38 million more from fares in fiscal year 2025 than budget-writers forecast. 
Eng, the T’s top boss, said he personally witnessed tourists board buses and trains without paying because they could not find a fare vending machine and did not have cash on hand. 
“We do believe that this is definitely helping new riders [and] visitors pay into our system, whereas before, perhaps they might not have been paying,” Eng told CommonWealth Beacon. “We also know that contactless has become such an easy way of payment, whether you’re riding the T, going to a store, going to get a cup of coffee. People are using that.” 
“It’s just more the norm, not having to stop at a [fare vending] machine if you choose not to,” he added. 
While the newest method has grown quickly, a plurality of riders continue to rely on other methods such as weekly and monthly passes. 
That’s likely a financial decision for many riders: contactless taps are convenient, but they also charge à la carte for each ride. Someone who knows they will travel enough in a certain span of time can pay less overall by purchasing an unlimited pass. 
Some other networks, including NYC Transit, have more advanced contactless systems in place that track each user and automatically cap what they pay once they hit the breakeven point for a given period. 
Eng said “all of those [options] are on the table,” but he declined to commit to any timeline for implementing fare-capping at the MBTA. His team is weighing several variables, including whether the change would shift some monthly passholders — who contribute a sizable chunk of fare revenue — to less-impactful single taps. 
“If we offer a product that we think many people would really enjoy, I want to make sure that I can keep that product, and it’s not just a pilot for six months, it is something that we’re ready to do, we’re ready to keep,” he said. 
After extensive delays and a ballooning budget hit previous fare overhaul attempts, the T launched the contactless payment system on subways, buses and trolleys in August 2024. The option expanded to ferries last summer. 
The T recently ramped up its efforts to prevent fare evasion with new civilian teams monitoring the systems. Riders face warnings and then fines for failing to pay. 
Officials are also testing several other tweaks to the fare-collection system this fall, including new fare vending machines in Orange Line stations, online accounts for users, and the option to acquire a digital CharlieCard. 
Eng compared the new ways to pay to the extensive repair campaign the T mounted to eliminate slow zones. Both, he said, tackled issues that had persisted for years with little progress visible to the public. 
“The contactless [project] is just one of many where we’re demonstrating that we’re a different T, that we are looking to really make wise investments and make sure that when we do deliver something, it’s useful and what the public has been asking for,” he said. 
Kane, who has been critical of past MBTA attempts to overhaul its fare system, said the relative success of contactless payments should encourage agency leaders to focus on “interoperability.” 
“The less customized, the better,” he said. “Using off-the-shelf technology allows people to use what they’re used to and it just makes it more seamless. People don’t care who the provider of their trips is. They just want to get where they’re going. The more we can do to make it easy and seamless, the better.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/taptopay-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-16 08:56:50.382962

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah’s Republican Party is writing a plot twist into the last act of the state’s redistricting case.  
As a deadline approaches to firm up boundaries for 2026, the Utah GOP launched a push Tuesday to block a map proposed by the Legislature and repeal a 2018 redistricting law.
The map from lawmakers is the least competitive for Democrats out of four options they considered after a judge struck down boundaries they drew in 2021, saying they came about unconstitutionally. 
Lawmakers’ proposed map was also endorsed by the Utah GOP just two weeks ago. But on Tuesday, Chairman Rob Axson filed a petition with Utah’s elections office for a referendum asking voters to reject the plan. Per state code, a group has 30 days to gather signatures from 8% of Utah voters — about 140,000 — including 8% of the voters in at least 15 of the state’s 29 Senate districts.

The map in question is one of three options on the table before a judge who has less than a month to make a final selection. The lieutenant governor, who is Utah’s top election official, set a deadline of Nov. 10. 
The move could drag the process into legally murky territory. If a referendum gets enough signatures, Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson is required to put a stay on the law set to be referred to voters.
In an interview Tuesday, Henderson said voters and candidates deserve a degree of certainty, and this adds more uncertainty to “an already tricky situation.”
Asked what her biggest fear is, Henderson replied: “That we won’t have maps when we need them, or that we’ll have to change in the middle of a process. We’re walking down some roads that have not been tread before. That is concerning from an election administration standpoint.”
Axson did not comment in response to requests from Utah News Dispatch on Tuesday.

The two other maps are being pitched by voting rights groups who sued the state over the 2021 maps: the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government, the Campaign Legal Center and some Salt Lake County voters. 
“It’s frustrating, it’s disappointing, and I just don’t understand,” said Elizabeth Rasmussen, executive director of Better Boundaries, the group behind the 2018 initiative creating an independent redistricting commission. “It’s honestly like one of the last things in their toolbox for them to really get rid of this law that they don’t like, and so we’re still going to be operating on all levels, through any means necessary.”
The Utah GOP is also seeking the repeal of Proposition 4, a 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative setting up an independent redistricting commission. Axson filed an application for an indirect initiative that would require roughly 70,000 signatures – or 4% of active registered voters – in at least 26 of Utah’s 29 state Senate districts, and by Nov. 15, before it can go to the Legislature for approval. 
A judge reinstated Proposition 4 this year, ruling lawmakers overstepped their constitutional authority when they turned the commission into an advisory body that lawmakers could ignore. That ruling also voided the state’s congressional boundaries last drawn in 2021, deeming them the result of an unconstitutional process.

Lawmakers have taken steps to require insurers to keep more accurate directories of doctors and specialists, but state rules still aren’t complete, and penalties are rare.


Mary Kuhn went to the emergency room at John Muir Medical Center because it felt like she was having a heart attack. Her chest and jaw hurt. Her tongue was numb. Instead of confirming a heart attack, testing later ordered by a cardiologist revealed a shocking diagnosis. 
Kuhn had a massive hiatal hernia that required surgery. Her entire stomach had pushed into her chest cavity through an opening in the diaphragm, a muscle that divides the torso, and was wrapped around itself. In the crowded space, her esophagus was bent and twisted. If the entwined organs kept rotating further, they could cut off their own blood supply. 
That could be fatal.  
On the hunt for a specialist, Kuhn ran into a problem that plagues many California patients: Doctors listed in her health insurer’s directory didn’t actually accept her insurance. She had encountered a “ghost network.” 
Ghost networks are a longstanding problem in California that advocates and lawmakers have tried to fix for more than a decade. Patients searching for primary care, physical or mental health therapy or specialty care discover that the lists of in-network providers published by insurance companies are frequently inaccurate or outdated — by some estimates a third or more of these listings may be inaccurate. Phone numbers and addresses may be wrong. Most frustrating is when listed providers no longer contract with a patient’s insurance company.
“We’ve been hearing for years from consumers, stories about how hard it is to find a provider,” said Katie Van Deynze, a lobbyist with Health Access California, a consumer advocacy group that has worked to improve provider directories. 
But insurers and providers oppose efforts to further regulate directories and blame each other for inaccuracies.
Kuhn’s primary care physician referred her to a cardiothoracic surgeon in Walnut Creek. That surgeon appeared in Blue Shield of California’s online directory of providers. Kuhn met with him in November and scheduled the surgery for January, she said.
Before that could happen, in December 2024, Blue Shield sent Kuhn a denial letter refusing to pay for the surgeon’s services, stating the doctor was “not in your health plan,” according to correspondence shared with CalMatters.
“I thought that’s a mistake. Of course he’s in-network, I see him there,” Kuhn said.
In a statement, Blue Shield spokesperson Mark Seelig said the company could not comment on an individual patient’s case, but defended its provider directory.

“Blue Shield rigorously validates its provider directory according to state and federal regulations. Providers must update and attest to their information every 90 days, and Blue Shield publishes changes within 48 hours and conducts regular audits,” Seelig said.
Patients need to select online the correct plan, provider group and location for the most accurate directory results, Seelig said.
This Oct. 10, nearly a year after Kuhn first encountered this issue, the physician was still listed as an in-network provider. A representative from the physician’s office confirmed to CalMatters that he is not part of the Blue Shield network.
Lawmakers struggle to fix errors
Lawmakers took steps 10 years ago to help patients more easily find in-network medical care, but the resulting rules are incomplete and underenforced. Bureaucracy and fierce industry opposition have blocked significant reform.
Anecdotally, patients struggle with inaccurate directory results every day, even when trying to find a primary care doctor, Health Access lobbyist Van Deynze said. As a result people delay care; conditions get worse; some even give up. 
“This is a really big barrier,” Van Deynze said.
During a legislative hearing earlier this year, Assembly Majority Leader Cecilia Aguiar-Curry told fellow lawmakers that health insurer directories have “significant error rates” despite existing law that requires them to publish accurate information.
The state has failed to enforce that 2015 law, she said, issuing “small penalties” to profitable insurers.
“There’s virtually no incentive for health plans to fix this problem,” Aguiar-Curry said.
The Department of Managed Health Care, which regulates most California health insurers, has issued eight penalties totaling $152,500 under the 2015 law. The largest penalty was $75,000, and the smallest was $5,000, according to data from the department.
In a statement, spokesperson Rachel Arrezola defended the regulatory agency’s oversight of plan directories.
“The Department uses its full authority to actively monitor health plan compliance with the provider directory standards in the law, and takes enforcement action, including administrative penalties, when plans violate the law,” Arrezola said.
Attempts to add more stringent enforcement requirements, however, keep stalling in the Legislature.
Three days before the end of the legislative session this year, Aguiar-Curry withdrew a bill that would have required directories to be 95% accurate by July 2029. That bill also would have authorized state insurance regulators to levy heftier fines on insurers that did not meet the accuracy benchmark. 
Gibson Martucci, a spokesperson for Aguiar-Curry, said the Department of Managed Health Care gave the lawmaker “late feedback” on the legislation that required Aguiar-Curry to convert it into a two-year bill. Part of the reason, Martucci said in a statement, was that the department is creating regulations authorized by the 2015 law that will be finalized soon.
Aguiar-Curry intends to revive the legislation in January once the department’ s regulations are finished, Martucci said.

“After more than a decade of consumer frustration, only binding timelines, real enforcement, and structural changes will deliver the improvements consumers need to access care,” Martucci said. 
Arrezola said the regulatory agency did not ask Aguiar-Curry to pull the bill. The department refused an interview request, pointing to the pending regulations. Those regulations aim to standardize the information that insurers need to publish in directories, including types of contact information, whether a provider is accepting new patients, and the date in which the directory was last updated.
“Adding a new, and duplicative auditing and verification process, to the provider directory, while pending rulemaking is occurring would conflict with work underway,” Arrezola said in a statement.
Zoe Bulls, a former intern with the Consumer Protection Policy Center at the University of San Diego who has closely watched the rulemaking process, said Aguiar-Curry’s bill went further than the department’s proposed regulations. 
“There’s obviously gaps in the efficacy of those standards, because we still don’t have highly accurate provider directories,” Bulls said.
Kuhn also said the pending regulations seemed weak.
Delays and denials lead to worse outcomes
The first time Kuhn met with the cardiothoracic surgeon, her condition was already perilous. 
He told her if she ever felt the need to vomit but was physically unable to do so, she needed to go to the emergency room right away. That would be a sign that her stomach was so twisted it required emergency surgery.
Kuhn told him she had already experienced that symptom twice.
He looked at Kuhn and said “You’re very lucky,” she recounted.
Still, it would be six months before Kuhn was able to get the operation following Blue Shield’s denial.
State law requires health insurers to cover out-of-network providers as if they were in-network if there are no other available providers. It also requires insurers to honor their directory that lists in-network providers. State and federal law also allow patients to appeal decisions made by insurers.
In the denial letter reviewed by CalMatters, Blue Shield stated that two in-network providers were qualified to perform the operation.

Neither could do what the specialist said was necessary, according to Kuhn and medical records reviewed by CalMatters. A thoracic surgeon who told Kuhn his expertise was in lung surgery said he couldn’t perform the operation. The other provider, a general surgeon, explained he could only perform part of the operation. He told Kuhn he would enter her abdomen and pull the stomach down, but wouldn’t address her twisted esophagus or fully fix the herniated diaphragm. So Kuhn appealed Blue Shield’s decision.
An appeal letter sent from the cardiothoracic surgeon’s office supporting Kuhn stated that “surgery was urgently needed due to her hernia being so large.” 
For months, as the appeals process played out, Kuhn’s health deteriorated. She experienced headaches, nausea and fatigue. Her heart raced at random times. She could hardly eat any food. Breathing and swallowing were difficult. Blue Shield said in a letter to Kuhn that her condition did not qualify for an expedited grievance review.
Blue Shield would deny her appeal twice.
Before all of this, Kuhn loved to walk and swim. She spent hours in the garden, carrying bags of mulch and working with her hands. As her health declined, her active life vanished. A group at Kuhn’s church in Lafayette prayed weekly that she would be able to get her operation.
By the time Kuhn went into surgery in June, her left lung had partially collapsed and a portion of the hernia had attached to her aorta.
“Think of what that general surgeon would have done to reach up and pull the stomach down. If he had, he would have ruptured my aorta,” Kuhn said.
Patients struggle nationwide with directory errors
It’s hard to know how many patients run into issues with ghost networks, but Google searches are often more accurate than provider directories, according to a nationwide assessment from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which looked at states’ efforts to improve directories. 
The most recent study on provider directories in California looked at data for all managed care plans over two years, 2018 and 2019. That study found that accuracy generally improved year over year, but many errors still persisted. 
For the state’s primary care providers in 2019, commercial plans had inaccurate information 24% of the time. Inaccuracies were generally worse among specialties, with 32% of endocrinology listings having wrong information.
On average about 50 people submit complaints about provider directories to the Department of Managed Health Care each year, according to data from the department. Patient advocates, however, say that’s an undercount because most people don’t know they can file complaints with the state or give up altogether. 
Industry groups say they support the goal of having accurate directories. In a letter to lawmakers from the California Association of Health Plans and the Association of California Life and Health Insurance Companies, the groups wrote that they want providers to share in the responsibility for maintaining accurate records. 
Plans spend more than $2 billion annually to maintain directories, they argue, and insurers can’t reliably update information if doctors and other providers don’t tell them when they’ve moved practices or dropped insurance. They also want state regulators to share in the role of ensuring directories are accurate. They oppose Aguiar-Curry’s legislation.
“It’s a matter of ensuring that providers and health plans are held to the same standards,” said Mary Ellen Grant, a spokesperson for the California Association of Health Plans. 
Kuhn’s insurer, Blue Shield, did not take a position on the bill but said the company was “committed to a comprehensive solution that increases accountability and ensures members can easily find in-network care.”
For their part, groups representing doctors, dentists and other providers also oppose the legislation, arguing that insurers are the ones responsible for maintaining the directories.
Major opponents have given more than $5.2 million to California legislators since 2015, according to the CalMatters Digital Democracy database.
The disagreement leaves patients like Kuhn in the lurch.
“From the patient’s perspective everything is so darn confusing,” Kuhn said. “The provider directory is a critical tool but if it is not maintained it is useless and increases the stress and difficulty of getting health care.” 
Reviewers frequently overturn insurance decisions
Kuhn sought an independent medical review at the advice of the U.S. Department of Labor, which regulates her plan. The reviewers agreed with her and overturned Blue Shield’s denials.
The reviewers wrote that Blue Shield should approve the cardiothoracic surgeon Kuhn wanted to perform the surgery because there were no other in-network providers who could do the operation.
The decision letter, reviewed by CalMatters, states that Kuhn had a “very complex” and “severe” condition that required a highly trained thoracic surgeon to correct. “This procedure should not be performed by a general surgeon” as Blue Shield suggested, reviewers wrote.

Kuhn should also only be responsible for regular in-network cost sharing, the decision states.
That letter allowed Kuhn to schedule her surgery, a relief after so many months. She had grown so weak that she couldn’t change the sheets on the bed without feeling faint. One time she even passed out.
A week before the surgery, Kuhn received a letter saying again that the cardiothoracic surgeon was not part of the Blue Shield of California network and that she could be responsible for paying his whole fee out-of-pocket. It was $258,000.
In a panic, she called the surgeon’s office and spoke to a patient advocate who assured her that she wouldn’t have to pay that amount. She was protected from “balance billing” by the No Surprises Act, which prohibits providers from charging patients for out-of-network services in certain situations.
Kuhn said she believes the warning letter was a scare tactic to get her to cancel the surgery.
“They delayed, they denied and then they tried to scare me,” she said.
By that time she felt like her body was giving out, and she went through with the surgery.
Today, Kuhn feels better than she has in years. Her asthma has improved. She can eat a full meal. She can go on a walk without becoming short of breath. Her heart no longer races. There’s no pain. Her church prayer group was elated.  
“I knew my life depended on not giving up,” Kuhn said. “If I had listened to their threats, I would have died.”

(Getty)A Birmingham charter school that opened with a mission toward LGBTQ+ youth will stay open another five years after the Alabama Public Charter School Commission approved its renewal application on Wednesday.
Magic City Acceptance Academy (MCAA), located in Homewood, opened in 2021 as the state’s only LGBTQ+ friendly charter school. MCAA currently serves over 300 students. The school was attacked by Republican gubernatorial candidate Tim James during the 2022 campaign for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, which led the school to increase security amid fears from students. 
The approval followed a debate among the commissioners over shortening the renewal to three years and comments from school officials that appeared to suggest they had downplayed the school’s outreach to LGBTQ+ children. 
The debate over renewal centered around SB 129. The law, passed in 2024, prohibits state agencies, local boards of education and higher learning institutions from sponsoring programs that are based on diversity, equity and inclusion or “divisive concepts.”
Patton Furman, principal and superintendent of MCAA, said Wednesday the school has been in compliance with the law.
“We have had to do things like repaint in certain areas, right? And I’ll just say the thing that, we’re all thinking, and that is that we have had rainbows in our building because we are referring to all people. And at some point our mission did include a segment that said we are affirming to LGBTQ people,” Furman said to the commissioners. “We are still affirming to all people, but we have taken that out. We are affirming to all people. We are affirming to our black students, we are affirming to our Hispanic students, we are affirming to our LGBTQ students, which are in every school in the state. So we have taken measures to not to not be divisive, and to embrace all of the students that we have in front of us.”
MCAA has also changed its logo, as well as maps inside the school, which identify the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, the name President Donald Trump has attempted to use. 
“Those are the things that we have been tasked to do to keep us from being quote, unquote divisive. So we are following the law to the letter, and we treat our students, every single one of them, regardless of what door they fit into in this world, we are embracing them all,” Furman said.
Commissioner Sharon Porterfield moved to approve MCAA for the three-year renewal, and a vote was in progress, until Commissioner Charles Knight pushed back saying he believed there should be a five-year renewal period for the school.
“They’ve got the financial support, they’ve got a good program, they’ve got the leadership. And again, we all agree that we’re trying to create environments where students are educated, and obviously they’re doing a good job of that,” Knight said, 
Commissioner Dorothy Hudson also agreed that the school should have the full five-year renewal.
“We’re not a local school board. When schools bring forth to us a legitimate proposal, and short of any major negatives or findings against their performance, why wouldn’t we present them with the option of five years to give them a chance to breathe and work forward to their growth and accomplishments?” Hudson asked.
With the renewal granted, Furman said MCAA will expand the school to add band and theater classrooms, administration and counseling offices, a green space in front of the school and added mental health services for students.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Classroom-e1675202619930-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-16 08:56:50.382962
,California,2025-10-16 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom did what he pledged to do to  jump-start housing production. Still no progress,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/newsom-housing-production-progress-california/,Gov. Gavin Newsom took the steps he vowed to take to stimulate housing production. But housing start numbers have barely budged in eight years.,"Eight years ago, as he began his campaign for governor, Gavin Newsom described fixing the state’s chronic housing shortage as a moral imperative.
“This is a question of who we are,” Newsom wrote in 2017. “Housing is a fundamental human need — let’s not forget the human face behind the dire statistics.
“Housing instability can cause genuine mental and physical adversity,” he added, “and lead to insufferable decisions: no one should have to choose between paying rent or buying groceries. Knowing that too many Californians face this kind of anxiety breaks my heart.”
Newsom pledged that as governor he would lead the effort to develop 3.5 million new housing units by 2025, “because our solutions must be as bold as the problem is big.
“I realize building 3.5 million new housing units is an audacious goal,” Newsom continued, “but it’s achievable. There is no silver bullet to solve this crisis. We need to attack the problem on multiple fronts by generating more funding for affordable housing, implementing regulatory reform and creating new financial incentives for local jurisdictions that produce housing while penalizing those that fall short.”
The 3.5 million-unit goal was never anywhere near realistic. It would have required increasing construction from about 100,000 units a year when he made the pledge to more than 400,000, doubling peak production in this century.
That said, Newsom has over the almost seven years of his governorship, pretty much, done what he said he’d do to increase housing. He has signed multiple bills meant to speed up housing permits by eliminating state and local legal impediments, capped by two major measures this year.
Newsom signed Assembly Bill 130, which makes it more difficult to use the California Environmental Quality Act as a tool to block housing projects, and Senate Bill 79, which overrides local government land use authority to authorize multi-family, multi-story housing projects near transit stops.
Meanwhile Newsom’s Department of Housing and Community Development has set statewide goals of 180,000 new units a year and 2.5 million units over eight years. It also imposed ambitious quotas on local governments to designate land for residential development and cracked down on communities that impede multi-family projects for low- and moderate-income families.
The latter effort responds to the most acute aspect of California’s shortage — housing the nearly 35% of Californians who are living in poverty or near-poverty, mostly due to housing costs that are among the nation’s highest.
With the enactment of AB 130 and SB 79, the looming conclusion of Newsom’s governorship and the likelihood that he will run for president, it’s time to appraise results.
Has the production of housing in California substantially increased? Unfortunately, no.
At the time Newsom made his pledge, about 100,000 units were being built each year, with the net increase substantially lower due to losses by fire or destruction. Eight years later, it’s virtually unchanged, no matter which authority one consults.
The Census Bureau reports that between 2019, when Newsom took office, and 2024 new housing permits in California ranged from a high of 120,780 units in 2022 to a low of 101,546 last year. Newsom’s own budget agrees with the Census Bureau’s data for the same period and projects future construction through 2028 at 100,000 to 104,000 units a year.
Clearly, even though systemic barriers to housing construction have been eased, many developers have been unable to see housing in California as a good investment. The COVID-19 pandemic, which had massive economic impacts, and increases in interest rates to battle inflation also have had an effect.
Housing is far more complicated than Newsom depicted it when he made his promises. He gets a ‘B’ for effort — and an ‘F’ for results.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/101124-Temecula-Housing-KC-CM-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-16 08:56:50.382962

(Photo by Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current) The film tax credit legislation promising to be the featured attraction in an upcoming special session of the Nevada Legislature is a Democratic bill.
Both sponsors of the bill, which failed in the waning hours of the regular legislative session earlier this year, are Democrats. One of them chairs the Nevada State Democratic Party. 
So it was not a little incongruous Wednesday when a baker’s dozen of progressive organizations that often ally with Democrats on issues and causes called on Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo to save the state from the Democrats’ noxious movie studio bill.
“Nevada is staring down serious financial uncertainty,” the groups wrote in a letter to Lombardo. “Every dollar we lock into a corporate handout is a dollar we can’t put toward our rainy-day readiness, public education, healthcare, wildfire mitigation, housing, and the basic services Nevadans rely on when times get tight.”
That’s all true, by the way.
So why didn’t the groups also address their letter to Democratic legislative leaders?
“It is on Gov. Lombardo to outline what is included in a special session,” said Amber Falgout with Battle Born Progress, noting the letter specifically referred to an analysis prepared for the Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED) showing the film studio bill is a raw deal for the state.
That’s all true, too. 
As the analysis for GOED indicates, the film tax credit proposal is not only fiscal folly but an economic development non-starter that promises not more economic diversification but merely more of the same. (In fact, if Lombardo wants to do something far more useful for Nevada working families and Nevada’s economy in a special session, instead of reviving movie studio subsidies he should push the child care tax credit plan he only half-heartedly proposed earlier this year.)
And as Falgout notes, the state constitution says when a governor calls a special session he gets to specifically declare what subjects legislators can address.
But if Lombardo called a special session to create more Nevada-funded public welfare for rich Californians, and the bill didn’t pass, that would make Lombardo look weaker and more bumbling than any governor in modern memory. Even Jim Gibbons. Yes, the special session agenda is technically up to Lombardo and Lombardo alone. But as a practical matter, it’s nigh on inconceivable that Lombardo would put film tax credits at the heart of a special session unless he’s confident it has enough Democratic support to pass. 
It had enough to pass the bill out of the Assembly in May, when 15 Assembly Democrats, including Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, voted with seven Republicans in favor of the tax credits. (11 Democrats and 9 Republicans were opposed.)
The bill then made it to the floor of the Senate, but only as the session was winding down and after Democratic Senate Majority Leader Nicolle Cannizzaro ordered up a special rule suspension to yank it out of a committee and plop it in front of the full Senate. During a late-session legislative pile-up, the clock literally ran out on the bill, which never did get a Senate floor vote.
But the largest public subsidy to the private sector in Nevada history came frighteningly close to becoming law. 
Yeager and Cannizzaro will still be in charge of the Assembly and Senate respectively next month when Lombardo is expected to call a special session.
Battle Born Progress, AFSCME, the Nevada State Education Association, the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada,  and the nine other organizations that urged Lombardo to give film tax credits the boot Wednesday should likewise publicly urge Yeager and Cannizzaro to step away from the movie studio handout. It’s only fair.
And speaking of fairness, it is also only fair to note that each of the organizations signing the letter to Lombardo have opposed policies favored by Democratic legislative leaders more than once over the years, particularly with respect to corporate giveaways like the one today’s Democratic leadership appears poised to approve.
The progressive groups didn’t call out Democratic legislative leadership Wednesday. But there’s still time to energize their considerable influence and publicly shame, er, remind Yeager and Cannizzaro that corporate white guys in ties are not the only powerful Nevada Democratic constituency, and not the most important one.
But wait. It’s more than just a handout. It’s a tax break.
If enacted, the film tax credit would be a nauseating public subsidy to out-of-state corporations that don’t need public subsidies from a state that can’t afford to subsidize them.
So people have understandably focused on that.
But quietly tucked just beneath the bill’s abominable essence, lurking like a tiny little criminal, as it were, the bill would also grant tax breaks to some of Nevada’s largest and most powerful corporations, including the resort and mining industries’ biggest players.
To reiterate, here is how the film tax credits would work.

Let’s say the state issues Sony Pictures tax credits with a face value of $50 million.
Tax credits sell for less than face value (this is why corporations buy them). A discount of about 10% isn’t unusual. 
Some corporation in Nevada with a tax bill, let’s say MGM Resorts International, buys Sony’s $50 million in tax credits for $45 million in actual money. 
Instead of paying the state $50 million in gaming taxes that it owes, MGM gives the state the otherwise utterly worthless paper it bought from Sony that has the words “tax credits” on it.
Sony gets $45 million from MGM.
MGM gets a $5 million tax break.
And the state, which otherwise would have received $50 million in tax revenue from MGM, gets nothing.

Because of the way Nevada’s ditzy tax system is built, along with gaming and mining, insurance and banking are the other Nevada industries most likely to obtain state tax breaks by purchasing tax credits from California film corporations. 
The bill the Assembly passed earlier this year authorized $1.5 billion worth of tax credits over 15 years, and the lion’s share of that benefit would go to film corporations. But gaming, mining, et al., would also reap a not inconsiderable financial gain at the public’s expense.
Elected Nevada Democrats at all levels of government tend to be some of the most big-business-friendly Democrats in the nation.
So if the movie studio welfare bill is enacted during a special session, Democrats on the ballot next year should be more than happy to explain why, especially in these times, they voted to approve not only the biggest corporate handout in state history, but also tax breaks for large corporations in the process.
It’s their bill, after all.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SteveYeager-NicoleCannizzaro-FabianDonate-1-scaled-e1760584111666-1024x686.jpg,,,2025-10-16 10:04:17.682684
,California,2025-10-16 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,This preschool serves kids with traumatic backgrounds. Here’s what researchers learned from them,Adriana Heldiz and Adam Ashton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/2025/10/mi-escuelita-preschool-programs/,Children with traumatic experiences who attend Mi Escuelita preschool in San Diego graduate ready for kindergarten and continue to do well in school for years.,"In summary
Children with traumatic experiences who attend Mi Escuelita preschool in San Diego graduate ready for kindergarten and continue to do well in school for years.


Almost 20 years ago a San Diego nonprofit created a preschool to focus on the “little guys” — children who experience domestic violence and other serious traumatic events before kindergarten. 
Today, Mi Escuelita is still going strong and it’s something of a model in showing other schools how to address childhood trauma.
Mi Escuelita provides services for kids in a single location that for most other families would require intricate coordination among multiple health care providers, educators and social programs. 
The children learn in a classroom that is always staffed with at least one therapist, they participate in one-on-one therapy, and join group therapy sessions. Their parents take part in special classes, too, where they learn ways to support their children.
Researchers from UC San Diego have paid close attention to Mi Escuelta and followed how its graduates fared after leaving the preschool. The university also works with the school to evaluate outcomes from each cohort of students. Here are four takeaways from those reports.
The kids leave ready for kindergarten
Students who graduate from Mi Escuelia outperform or do at least well as their peers in kindergarten, according to a UC San Diego analysis of their scores in reading and math tests.
It looked at kindergarten students in the Chula Vista Elementary School District from 2007 to 2013 and found a higher percentage of Mi Escuelita met math, reading and writing standards than the district’s general population.
That’s not a given because research shows that children exposed to domestic violence have lower verbal ability than their peers, which can set them back in school. 
And they do well for years
The length of UC San Diego’s study allowed its team to follow Mi Escuelita graduates through fifth grade. The results suggested that their preschool experience helped the kids throughout their childhoods. 
Their average scores on several standardized tests exceeded those of the general population at Chula Vista Elementary School District, especially in math.
“Taken together, the Mi Escuelita program demonstrates clear benefits to children who may otherwise fall quickly and unsparingly behind with regard to school readiness,” the UC San Diego researchers wrote. 
Better relationships at home
Some families turn to Mi Escuelita in moments of distress, such as after experiencing domestic violence. The preschool provides counseling for parents and students alike, which may contribute to behavioral improvements at home.
Over the past five years, 64% of the families in the program reported sensing fewer conflicts and 83% of them noticed an increase in closeness. 
“Families reported that children’s communication, behavior, and listening skills improved both at home and at school,” a UC San Diego team wrote in an evaluation of student and parent surveys that spanned 2020 to 2024. 
It takes a village
Running Mi Escuelita costs about $1.3 million a year, a sum that nonprofit South Bay Community Services raises through a mix of donations and government funding. That cost — along with the challenge of hiring trained educators and therapists — makes the program difficult to replicate. 
But, other schools and government agencies are watching Mi Escuelita to see what kind of services they can carry over to other venues. 
“We can spend less later on intervention programs and alternative facilities,” said Hilaria Bauer, chief early learning services officer at Kidango, a Bay Area nonprofit childcare provider. “There will be less truancy, less big behaviors or expulsions or alternative programs, and all of those ‘fix’ initiatives if we really focus on the time in the life of a child that really makes a change.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/061125_Mi-Escuelita_AH_CM_19.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-16 08:56:50.382962

Californians can find resources through their doctors, preschools and First Five. Here's how to get started.","In summary
Know a young child who experienced serious trauma? Californians can find resources through their doctors, preschools and First Five. Here’s how to get started.


Sometimes, parents just know their child needs special attention.
That’s especially true for parents of children who’ve experienced serious traumatic events, such as domestic violence.
California for the past several years has created a range of programs and tools to help those families find the help they need. 
They’re rooted in studies on what’s known as Adverse Childhood Experiences, or ACES, a term that captures the kind of trauma that can lead to debilitating consequences for a young person’s health and education. 
“If we could heal children, we would have healthier adults,” said First Five California Executive Director Jackie Thu-Huong Wong, whose organization supports early learning services throughout the state.
CalMatters today published a special report on Mi Escuelita, a preschool in San Diego that for almost 20 years has built a healing environment for young children exposed to trauma. 
We also spoke with Wong to learn about what California families should know when they begin looking for assistance after trauma. 
Here are some of her recommendations:
How do I know if my child needs extra attention?
If you start to notice a change from their normal behavior — a child who is normally well-behaved starts to act out or becomes more reserved and quiet — it could be a sign of a deeper issue. Also keep an eye to changes to their eating or sleeping habits. 
“Any change in normal behavior is a good time to wonder,” said Wong. 
If you know your child is experiencing toxic stress, but you haven’t noticed changes in their behavior, you can still begin looking for support. Untreated trauma within children can lead to low academic performance and a variety of health problems such as substance abuse, developing eating disorders, heart disease and diabetes.
Who should I reach out to for help?
Once you start to notice a change, you might naturally head to Google to see if you can find any resources. While that can be helpful, it can also lead you down rabbit holes that can cause confusion or more stress during an already difficult time. 
For Californians, the First 5 California website is a good place to start. It offers resources, tips and information on providers in your area as well as information about how toxic stress can affect a child.
“This is different from everyday stress, like missing a test or not knowing exactly how to tie a shoe,” Wong said. “We’re talking about a deeper, more long-term.”
What about a doctor?
You can also get in touch with a pediatrician who can provide a screening to see if a child or adult has been exposed to traumatic childhood events such as abuse, violence or neglect.
Once the assessment is complete, the pediatrician will provide a treatment plan, education and resources that parents can access to support their child.
What type of support should my child receive at school?
Mental health services can vary depending on your child’s school. Some schools may offer counseling and intervention programs.
If you believe your child might need mental health support, get in touch with a school counselor or administrator who can provide more information on the services they offer. 
It could result in a detailed plan from the school describing accommodations for the child. In California schools, that’s known as an individualized education program, or IEP.
CalMatters’ recent reporting highlights the on-site mental health services offered at Mi Escuelita in San Diego. It is not, however, the only therapeutic preschool in the state. Below is a list of some of the other options.

Republican voters in eastern Alabama will choose a nominee for the House District 38 special election on Tuesday. (Eric Schultz for Alabama Reflector)Republican voters in Chambers and Lee counties will go to the polls Tuesday to choose a GOP candidate for a special election in House District 38.
The district covers southeastern Chambers County and most of eastern Lee County in east Alabama. It was held by Rep. Debbie Wood, R-Valley, until she resigned this summer to move near the Florida panhandle, where her husband works. 
Voters will choose between Garrett Dixon, Micah Messer and Kristin Nelson. The candidate that gets at least 50% of votes will face Democratic nominee Hazel Floyd on Feb. 3. If no candidate gets 50% of votes, a runoff primary election will be on Nov. 18.

Messages seeking comment from Dixon were left Wednesday.
Nelson, 41, is advocating for a flat state income tax rate, which can only be done through a constitutional amendment. The 2-5% rate is set by a 1933 constitutional amendment.
Nelson said in a phone interview Wednesday afternoon that she also wants every public and private school in the state to have a school resource officer on duty. 
“Over 85% of our children in the state are publicly educated, so we need to make sure that it is the very best that it can be, and equip our teachers to do exactly what they know how to do, and not stifle them with all kinds of parameters and check boxes,” Nelson said. “At the same time, I believe that it is a parent’s right and their choice to be able to educate their children in the way that they feel led.”
Nelson said voters should choose her because she has committed to the area her whole life.
Messer, who ran for the seat against Wood in 2022, said in an interview Wednesday that he is advocating for tax reform, reduced crime and election auditing.
Wood sponsored a bill in 2025 that would have required a random audit of all state elections. It passed the House in March, but was never considered by the Senate. According to the Movement Advance Project, seven states do not have a law requiring an election audit.
There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud or voter fraud reaching levels to overturn an election. According to the Heritage Foundation, a conservative leaning think tank that tracks election fraud, there have been 39 cases of election deceit in Alabama in the past 25 years. By comparison, over 2.2 million Alabamians voted in last year’s presidential election.
“I have a lot of different varying experiences that will fit very well with District 38 and allow me to be a great voice and great representative for the entire district,” Messer said.
In a statement on Dixon’s campaign website, the cotton and peanut farmer said he understood the issues that rural Alabamians face.
“Garrett Dixon is ready to stand up and be a voice for the district he’s always called home,” the statement said.
The primary election will not matter for Floyd’s candidacy, but she said in an interview Wednesday that she hopes voters choose a Republican candidate based on their policies and morals.
“Just because this person has more signs, this person has bigger signs, that doesn’t mean they’re going to be better at the job,” Floyd said. “That just means they have more financial backing. Then you need to start questioning, ‘where are they getting this backing from?’”
Floyd is campaigning on boosting business development beyond Valley city limits, strengthening public education funding and supporting farmers. She said Wednesday that, through talking with the community, other issues are important to her too, like advocating for better pay for teachers and affordable housing for the elderly.
“I still want to help bring businesses in and things like that, but you’ve got to handle those issues that are in front of you, that you can handle, immediately,” Floyd said.
According to campaign finance records, Dixon has raised more than $55,000 and spent almost $41,000. About one-third of Dixon’s donations came from Political Action Committees (PACs). He had almost $7,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began.
Nelson has raised over $22,000 and spent almost $21,000 since the beginning of the special election in August. She had about $11,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began. All of her cash donations came from individuals and businesses.
Messer has raised about $16,000 and spent almost $22,000. He had almost $9,000 on-hand before the special election cycle began. According to campaign finance records, the EAGL PAC donated $1,000, the sole PAC donation to Messer’s campaign.

While plowing a wheat field in rural Washington state in the 1990s, William Wallace spotted a gray plane overhead that he believed was releasing chemicals to make him sick. The rancher began to suspect that all white vapor trails from aircraft might be dangerous.
He shared his concern with reporters, acknowledging it sounded a little like “The X Files,” a science fiction television show.
Academics cite Wallace’s story as one of the catalysts behind a fringe concept that has spread among adherents to the Make America Healthy Again, or MAHA, movement and is gaining traction at the highest levels of the federal government. Its treatment as a serious issue underscores that under President Donald Trump, unscientific ideas have unusual power to take hold and shape public health policy.
The concept posits that airplane vapor trails, or contrails, are really “chemtrails” containing toxic substances that poison people and the terrain. Another version alleges planes or devices are being deployed by the federal government, private companies, or researchers to trigger big weather changes, such as hurricanes, or to alter the Earth’s climate, emitting hazardous chemicals in the process.
Several GOP lawmakers and leaders in the Trump administration remain convinced the concepts are legitimate, though scientists have sought to discredit such claims.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is planning to investigate climate and weather control, and is expected to create a task force that will recommend possible federal action, according to a former agency official, an internal agency memo obtained by KFF Health News, and a consultant who helped with the memo.
The plans, along with comments by top GOP lawmakers, show how rumors and conspiracy theories can gain an air of legitimacy due to social media and a political climate infused with falsehoods, some political scientists and researchers say.
“When we have low access to information or low trust in our sources of information, a lot of times we turn to our peer groups, the groups we are members of and we define ourselves by,” said Timothy Tangherlini, a folklorist and professor of information at the University of California-Berkeley. He added that the government’s investigation of conspiracy theories “gives the impression of having some authoritative element.”
HHS is expected to appoint a special government employee to investigate climate and weather control, according to Gray Delany, former head of the agency’s MAHA agenda, who said he drafted the memo. The agency has interviewed applicants to lead a “chemtrails” task force, said Jim Lee, a blogger focused on weather and climate who Delany said helped edit the memo, which Lee confirmed.
“HHS does not comment on future or potential policy decisions and task forces,” agency spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in an email.
The memo alleges that “aerosolized heavy metals such as Aluminum, Barium, and Strontium, as well as other materials such as sulfuric acid precursors, are sprayed into the atmosphere under the auspices of combatting global warming,” through a process of stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI.
“There are serious concerns SAI spraying is leading to increased heavy metal content in the atmosphere,” the memo states.
The memo claims, without providing evidence, that the substances cause elevated heavy-metal content in the atmosphere, soil, and waterways, and that aluminum is a toxic product used in SAI linked to dementia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, asthma-like illnesses, and other chronic illnesses. The July 14 memo was addressed to White House health adviser Calley Means, who didn’t respond to a voicemail left by a reporter seeking comment.
High-level federal government officials are presenting false claims as facts without evidence and referring to events that not only haven’t occurred but, in many cases, are physically impossible, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California.
“That is a pretty shocking memo,” he said. “It doesn’t get more tinfoil hat. They really believe toxins are being sprayed.”
Kennedy has previously promoted debunked chemtrail theories. In May, he was asked on “Dr. Phil Primetime” about chemicals being sprayed into the stratosphere to change the Earth’s climate.
“It’s done, we think, by DARPA,” Kennedy said, referring to a Department of Defense agency that develops emerging technology for the military’s use. “And a lot of it now is coming out of the jet fuel. Those materials are put in jet fuel. I’m going to do everything in my power to stop it. We’re bringing on somebody who’s going to think only about that.”
DARPA officials didn’t return a message seeking comment.
Federal messaging
Deploying chemtrails to poison people is just one of many baseless conspiracy theories that have found traction among Trump administration health policy officials led by Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist before entering politics. He continues to promote a supposed link between vaccines and autism, as well as make statements connecting fluoride in drinking water to arthritis, bone fractures, thyroid disease, and cancer. The World Health Organization says fluoride is safe when used as recommended.
Delany, who was ousted in August from HHS, said Kennedy has expressed strong interest in chemtrails.
“This is an issue that really matters to MAHA,” said Delany, referring to the informal movement associated with Kennedy that is composed of people who are skeptical of evidence-based medicine.
The memo also alleges that “suspicious weather events have been occurring and have increased awareness of the issue to the public, some of which have been acknowledged to have been caused by geoengineering activities, such as the flooding in Dubai in 2024.” Geoengineering refers to intentional large-scale efforts to change the climate to counteract global warming.
“It is unconscionable that anyone should be allowed to spray known neurotoxins and environmental toxins over our nation’s citizens, their land, food and water supplies,” Delany’s memo states.
Scientists, meteorologists, and other branches of the federal government say these assertions are largely incorrect. Some points in the memo are accurate, including concerns that commercial aircraft contribute to acid rain.
But critics say the memo builds on kernels of truth before veering into unscientific fringe theories. Efforts to control the weather are being made, largely by states and local governments seeking to combat droughts, but the results are modest and highly localized. It isn’t possible to manipulate large-scale weather events, scientists say.
Severe flooding in the United Arab Emirates in 2024 couldn’t have been caused by weather manipulation because no technology could create that kind of rainfall event, Maarten Ambaum, a meteorologist at the University of Reading who studies Gulf region rainfall patterns, said in a statement on the floods. Similar debunked claims emerged this year after central Texas experienced devastating floods.
The Government Accountability Office concluded in a 2024 report that questions remain as to the effectiveness of weather modification.
Research into changing the climate has been conducted, including work by one private company that engaged in field tests. Still, federal agencies say no ongoing or large-scale projects are underway. Study of the concept remains in the research phase. The Environmental Protection Agency says there are no large-scale or government efforts to affect the Earth’s climate.
“Solar geoengineering is not occurring via direct delivery by commercial aircraft and is not associated with aviation contrails,” the agency says on its website.
Widespread misinformation
Misperceptions about weather, climate control, and airplane contrails extend beyond the Trump administration, scientists said.
In September, a congressional House committee hearing titled “Playing God With the Weather — A Disastrous Forecast” involved two hours of debate on the once-fringe idea. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who chaired the hearing, has introduced legislation to ban weather and climate control, with a fine of up to $100,000 and up to five years in prison.
Some Democrats objected to the nature of the discussion. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) accused Greene of using “the platform of Congress to proffer anti-science theories, to platform climate denialism.”
Frequently citing chemtrails, GOP lawmakers have introduced legislation in about two dozen states to ban weather modification or geoengineering. Florida passed a bill to establish an online portal so residents can report alleged violations.
“The Free State of Florida means freedom from governments or private actors unilaterally applying chemicals or geoengineering to people or public spaces,” GOP Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a press statement this spring.
Meanwhile, the chemtrail conspiracy has permeated popular culture. The title track on singer Lana Del Ray’s seventh studio album is entitled “Chemtrails Over the Country Club.” Bill Maher dove into the chemtrail myth on his podcast “Club Random,” saying, “This is nuts. It’s just nuts.” And “Chemtrails,” a psychological thriller, wrapped filming in July.
Social media has given wing to the chemtrails concept and other fringe ideas involving public health. They include an outlandish belief that Anthony Fauci, who advised both Trump and President Joe Biden on the government response to the covid-19 pandemic, created the AIDS epidemic. There is no evidence of such a link, public health leaders say.
Researchers say another false belief by those on the far right holds that people who received covid vaccines could shed the virus, causing infertility in the unvaccinated. There is no evidence of such a connection, scientists and researchers say.
More severe weather events due to global warming may be driving some of the baseless theories, scientists say. And risks occur when such ideas take hold among the general population or policymakers, some public health leaders say. Climate researchers, including Swain, say they’ve received death threats.
Lee, the blogger, said he disagrees with some of the more far-fetched beliefs and is aware of the harm they can cause.
“There are people wanting to shoot down planes because they think they are chemtrails,” said Lee, adding that some believers are afraid to venture outside when plane vapor trails are visible overhead.
There is also no evidence that plane contrails cause health problems or are related to intentional efforts to control the climate, according to the EPA and other scientists.
The memo and focus at HHS on climate and weather control are alarming because they perpetuate conspiracies, said David Keith, a professor of geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago.
“It’s unmoored to reality,” he said. “I expected there were documents like this, but seeing it in print is nevertheless shocking. Our government is being driven by nonsensical dreck from dark corners of social media.”

(Photos by Andrew Harnik/Getty and Fran Baltzer, Danielle Richards, and Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)Four of New Jersey’s largest cities want a federal judge to throw out the U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit challenging their sanctuary policies for undocumented immigrants, arguing the Trump administration wants to relitigate cases that have already been resolved by federal judges. 
In three separate legal briefs filed this week, attorneys for Hoboken, Jersey City, Newark, and Paterson said the federal government’s May complaint against them mirrors lawsuits that the Department of Justice and two counties lost years ago over the state’s Immigrant Trust Directive. That 2018 order — which restricts state and local police from aiding in civil immigration enforcement in most cases — was upheld by the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in 2021.
The Trump administration has argued that ruling was wrongly decided, and that illegal immigration has become such a bigger problem since then that the decision warrants reconsideration. Attorneys for the four cities argue the 3rd Circuit decision binds the judge who is overseeing the current dispute and that the Constitution protects the cities from interference from the federal government in this matter.
“Cities have the sovereign authority to decide whether and to what extent their officials will voluntarily cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts,” Gurbir Grewal, an attorney for Newark and Hoboken, wrote in that city’s brief.
Grewal is a former state attorney general who was the architect of the state Immigrant Trust Directive.
The dispute is one of many initiated by President Donald Trump’s administration during the first year of his second term, one aimed at boosting his effort to detain and deport millions of undocumented immigrants. The lawsuit targets not just the four New Jersey cities but also some of their elected leaders.
The administration claims the local policies violate the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which prevents state law from overruling federal law. Trump has said he’d withhold federal funds from states and localities that don’t end their sanctuary policies.
The filings from the four cities, which are motions to dismiss the Trump administration lawsuit, largely rest on the same argument: courts have already rejected the federal government’s push to force local police to help enforce civil immigration law. The cities point to the 10th Amendment’s anticommandeering doctrine, which bars the federal government from ordering states or municipalities to carry out federal functions. 
Paterson’s sanctuary policy “does not obstruct federal law; it merely declines to expend municipal resources on federal civil-immigration enforcement,” that city’s attorneys wrote.
Newark’s and Jersey City’s sanctuary orders date to 2017, the first year of Trump’s initial term as president. Hoboken’s was issued in January 2018, and Paterson’s came in the form of a police policy that became effective in June 2019. 
The cities argue that because its police officers would be bound by the state Immigrant Trust Directive if they didn’t have similar policies on the local level, the Trump administration can’t identify any harm it has suffered from the local orders.
Attorneys for Jersey City said if it rescinded its sanctuary city executive order, that action would “result in absolutely no change in how the Jersey City Police Department voluntarily cooperates with federal law enforcement, since the Directive still governs.”
Lawyers for the cities also note that their sanctuary policies explicitly say local police are not restricted from cooperating with federal agents to apprehend immigration accused of crimes.
U.S. District Judge Evelyn Padin could decide on the matter as early as next month.

Increased reliance on the property tax makes the tax system more complex and less fair.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jack Hoffman: Vermont should not fund schools with property taxes.","This commentary is by Jack Hoffman, a senior policy analyst with the Public Assets Institute. Before joining Public Assets, he covered politics and state government in Vermont for 20 years. He was formerly a longtime resident of Marshfield.  


Recently, residents of the town of Windham wrote about how their neighbors on fixed incomes saw a nearly four-fold increase in their property tax bills after a town-wide reappraisal this year.  
Concerned that big hikes would force folks out of their homes, the authors wondered why these low-income Vermonters — who according to Vermont statute should pay no more than 4.5% of the income for property taxes — were now facing bills as high as 16% of their incomes. 
It’s a good question. 
The answer lies buried in the technicalities of our property tax system, specifically the one-year lag in how the Vermont Tax Department calculates property tax credits that the authors referred to in their commentary. The income-based tax credit you get this year is based on last year’s property taxes. So, if your property taxes increase dramatically as they did in Windham, the credit will not be sufficient to protect you from a big jump in your bill. 
Unfortunately, the lag is just one part of the problem that makes the property tax system so unfair and incomprehensible. Act 73 — the new education transformation bill enacted by the Legislature this year — will eliminate Vermonters’ option to pay their school taxes based on income, so more Vermonters will find themselves in situations like those in Windham.  
Act 73 creates a new homestead exemption. Vermonters with up to $115,000 in household income will pay based on a percentage of their home’s value (up to $425,000). As income goes up, that percentage goes up. Those with household income of $115,000 or more pay the full property tax bill on their home. 
Because the bills are tied to property value, the next reappraisal would very likely result in another big tax spike.  
The problem is the property tax. It is based on the value of a primary home, which is not a good indicator of a Vermonter’s ability to pay. Property values often rise faster than income — and besides, we pay our taxes out of our income, not by selling off a portion of our home. For most Vermonters, the value of their home is greater than their net worth because they have mortgages and other debt.   
There is an alternative system that is much simpler and that better reflects the way Vermonters live. An income-based education tax would eliminate the spikes in education taxes caused by reappraisals and align education tax bills with Vermonters’ ability to pay. 
That’s why most Vermonters support paying school taxes based on income, according to polling done over the past three decades. The Public Assets Institute has analyzed how an income-based system would work and has published several reports that explain it in understandable terms. 
But with Act 73, the Legislature and the governor are moving in the opposite direction by basing school taxes less on income and more on a home’s property value. 
Increased reliance on the property tax makes the tax system more complex and less fair, which in turn makes Vermonters more vulnerable to changing property values as upper-income people continue to bid up Vermont property for a second home, for a short-term rental property or for a primary residence.

“The regular customers of the businesses downtown have not been swayed,” said Will O’Connor, a part owner of Rick E’s, a sports bar located in the downtown area. “I think they believe in the downtown, they believe in the businesses they support. I don’t think there is a pervasive sense of fear, but I have heard from some groups who were planning to visit downtown, in the aftermath of the shooting, that they were concerned about safety.”

The event was partly a rally aimed at motivating proprietors to maintain their faith in the downtown area and a way for business owners to ask questions to the city’s tourism and economic development staff, as well as the local police, about loitering and alcohol regulations in place since the shooting.
The Oct. 4 shooting, which took place during celebrations after a football game, killed Jeremiah Morris, 17, and Shalanda Williams, 43. Seven of the victims were under the age of 20. Montgomery police have charged two people in connection with the shooting.
James Graboys, Montgomery’s chief of police, told the business owners at the forum that the perpetrators will eventually be held accountable.
“We are never going to stop until we get them,” he said to the crowd during the event. “We have already gotten two of them, and we are going to get more.” He then said that the department has taken into custody additional people who are “on the periphery, we just haven’t gone to the press on them.”
Several business owners said they had seen foot traffic decline following the shooting.
“Fridays and Saturdays, especially during this time of year, can really get busy,” said Megan Gibson, manager of the coffee shop Prevail located along Dexter Avenue in downtown Montgomery. “People walk around, they are hanging out, the parking spots are full. This weekend was one of the first weekends in a long time when I walked out, it is 5 p.m. and there are so many parking spots.”
She said that Prevail only had four people at one point during the weekend.
Since the shooting, city officials have suspended an ordinance that allowed visitors in the downtown’s entertainment district to carry open alcohol containers. .
“It definitely has affected us,” Gibson said. “Yes, I serve coffee, but I serve beer and wine as well, and people can take their beer and wine and walk down to the next place. Now, they can’t do that.”
The city will also more strictly enforce regulations meant to prohibit people from loitering, Graboys said. O’ Connor said the city has to balance loitering enforcement against the benefits of allowing patrons to walk about the downtown area to frequent restaurants and bars.
“I was just curious about the definition of that was and how we intended to address loitering or control loitering,” O’Connor said. “At the same time that loitering is getting reflected as a cause for concern, we also want a busy, walkable, vibrant downtown.”
Graboys said that the loitering ordinance will be targeted at illegal activity.
“Loitering is hanging out to do bad things,” Graboys said during the event. “Maybe they are carrying weapons, smoking dope, doing things they should not do downtown.”
As for the open carry ordinance, Graboys said that it remains suspended until further notice.
“If people have a cooler, that is going to get dumped out,” he said.
LaConya Murray, chair of Main Street Montgomery, said they wanted to ensure downtown business owners’ concerns were heard.
“There was some miscommunication about the entertainment district and that it was closed and what that meant,” she said. “We want to make sure that residents of Montgomery know that downtown Montgomery is open, Main Street businesses are open for business. We also wanted to put a pulse on the community.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7509-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-16 07:56:50.778223

Up for consideration on Wednesday were two packages of bills, one limiting the number of licenses for marijuana retailers and provisioning centers, and another aiming to address the sale of unregulated intoxicating hemp products, though Moss noted there would be additional meetings on the bills in the future.
Sen. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing) explained that the first package, Senate Bills 597 and 598, would cap licensing for marijuana retailers and licensing for wholesalers to one license per 10,000 residents in a municipality beginning Jan. 1, 2026, similar to how the state regulates liquor sales.
Communities with fewer than 10,000 residents would always have at least one license, Singh said. 
Additionally, the bills allow current license holders to renew their licenses or transfer them to another individual. 
The second set, Senate Bills 599–602, would create a regulatory framework for consumable hemp products in Michigan, Sen. Dayna Polehanki (D-Livonia) explained, noting that intoxicating products made from hemp, including Delta-8 and other synthesized cannabinoids are being sold in Michigan gas stations, convenience stores, and online without oversight or testing.

Both proposals received support from the Cannabis Regulatory Agency – which regulates Michigan’s adult-use cannabis industry – as well as several members of the state’s cannabis industry. 
Derek Sova, a policy and legislative specialist for the agency, said one of the challenges the agency is presently facing is that of marijuana versus hemp, when the conversation should be on whether a substance is intoxicating or non-intoxicating. 
Conventionally the understanding is that hemp is a crop or a textile, Sova explained, with both Michigan and the federal government’s definition of hemp and marijuana allowing for the unregulated sale of products with large amounts of THC – the component in marijuana that is primarily responsible for its intoxicating effect. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Because of the way the definition is, they are considered hemp, and because of that, they are not age-gated. There’s not a requirement for testing, like there is in Michigan with marijuana products. There are not restrictions on labeling,” Sova said. 
Alongside setting up a regulatory framework for non-intoxicating consumable hemp products, like CBD-infused gummies, and intoxicating hemp products, Sova noted the bill package would deregulate the sale of nonconsumable hemp, which is used to make textiles and building materials. 
“Right now, under the current law, you have to get a license to make that,  license to sell that. In our opinion, that doesn’t seem like it’s something that needs to be regulated,” Sova said.

Robin Schneider, executive director of the Michigan Cannabis Industry Association offered her support for capping licensing of marijuana provisioners and retailers, noting that unlimited licenses for marijuana cultivation has led to an oversupply, causing a drop in wholesale prices and bringing harm to businesses all the way down the supply chain. 
Additionally, the proliferation of retail spaces has led to public nuisance concerns, traffic issues and complaints from communities, Schneider said. 
“Our members are asking this committee to assist our industry in creating market stability and thoughtful and collaborative industry planning moving forward, so that at the very least they can make business decisions based on projections that include predictability,” Schneider said. 
The association also supported regulating intoxicating hemp products, noting that these products are being shipped into Michigan from out of state, and are not produced by Michigan hemp farmers. 
“Not only have our hemp farmers been left out and harmed in many ways, but current law does not even allow them to manufacture CBD-only consumable hemp products in Michigan,” Schneider said.

Kyleigh Cumming, the lab director for Kairos Labs, a cannabis testing lab, told committee members that the 2018 farm bill which defined hemp created a loophole that allowed for the conversion of CBD into compounds similar to THC.
“These conversion processes create many dangerous and unknown byproducts along the way, while also allowing products created to be marked as hemp-derived and sold in Michigan as unregulated, intoxicating vapes,” Cumming said. 
In a study of 15 vape products purchased in multiple Southeast Michigan communities, Cumming said the products had no lab testing results or traceability, and when acquiring the products, nobody asked for an ID to check for age. When the products were tested, the lab found 15 contaminants, and all 15 samples detected THC levels above the .3% level set by the federal government. 
While offering support for additional regulations on hemp products, Kimberly James, the director of cannabis affairs for the City of Detroit called for more teeth in the bill to allow local governments to take action when intoxicating hemp products are being sold at unlicensed locations. 
“The [Cannabis Regulatory Agency] currently does not enforce violations of the [Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act] against non-licensees, and I wouldn’t expect that it could enforce violations of this act against anyone who’s not a licensed consumable hemp processor,” James said. “Local governments need to have the authority to stop this practice immediately when products are in a regular store and explicitly state they contain THC.”
Polehanki promised to work with James to ensure these changes were made, saying the legislation is “no good unless these products can be taken off the market.”
Blain Becktold, the founder of iHemp Michigan, which represents hemp farmers, manufactures and businesses statewide, said the group’s members supported denying or restricting the sale of products that could cause harm when purchased or consumed, but took issue with its definition of hemp as cannabis with less than 0.3% THC, pointing to a federal push to increase that threshold to 1%. 
“That’s not to make more intoxicating products. That’s really for the safety of the growers and the farmers. If they invest that time, money and effort into the crop, and it goes hot over .3, then they’ve lost all that. At 1% we really wouldn’t have that problem,” Becktold said. 
Cassin Coleman of Cannabis Consumer Advocacy also raised concerns on the proposed regulations, noting that the limits on THC on nonintoxicating hemp products would limit access to certain products used by individuals for medical purposes.
“As is often the case, products that patients are using consistently, that are CBD products, they do contain THC,” Coleman said, noting that these products contain THC because they are “full spectrum” meaning they contain the full range of compounds that occur in the cannabis plant. 
By trying to remove or limit the amount of THC in these products, other important cannabinoids, plant proteins and antioxidants would be removed, Coleman said, warning that could make these products less effective.

The USDA recently announced the termination of the Household Food Security Report, a one-of-a-kind national survey on the impact of hunger on low-income Americans. Cancelling the report is a step backward in the fight to end hunger.   
For over 30 years, hunger relief organizations like The Food Group have relied on this data to understand the needs of food-insecure households and strategize how to best serve our communities. Without it, more hungry Americans will fall through the cracks, and hunger relief organizations will face more barriers responding to the need.   
It’s easy to ignore the problems we can’t see. Two years ago, a Minnesota state senator argued against universal school meals because he had never met a hungry person in Minnesota. The senator assumed that if he hadn’t seen the need with his own eyes, it wasn’t real.  
In my 15 years doing hunger-relief work, I’ve learned that food insecurity is hard to spot in Minnesota and often doesn’t look like you expect. Many people hide their struggles to access enough food due to the stigma. Others have a job, housing, and appear financially stable, but don’t make enough to afford the costly trifecta of housing, health care and food. I’ve also seen firsthand that hunger isn’t stagnant and things can change quickly.   
Each year, The Food Group hosts a leadership program for people who have experienced hunger firsthand. Their stories illustrate that food insecurity looks different for everyone.   
Some have lost jobs due to medical issues. Burned through savings. Qualified for SNAP and disability. Some are single moms, working 40 hours while raising kids. But many still need to rely on food shelves to get by, given the rapid food inflation in recent years. 
Hunger is real whether we choose to see it or not. It’s there whether it looks like we expect or completely different. Food security research is critical because it objectively captures the full spectrum of food insecurity.  
Each year, The Food Group releases an annual report on food shelf visit trends in Minnesota. In 2024, we tracked a record-breaking 9 million food shelf visits. We use this data to gain a clearer picture of statewide needs and plan how to meet  those needs and support frontline food shelf partners.   
If we didn’t collect and report on this data, it would not mean that food shelf visits were not rising. It would not mean that Minnesotans were less hungry or need less support. It would only mean that The Food Group — and those who rely on our research — wouldn’t be as equipped to step into the gap.   
Imagine public health authorities canceling tests of a communicable disease and then pretending the lack of data meant there was no spread of the disease. 
In their statement announcing the termination of the report, the USDA wrote that the “these redundant, costly, politicized and extraneous studies do nothing more than fear monger.” 
Collecting data on food insecurity is not fearmongering; it’s recording the real but often overlooked experiences of hungry people across our state. 
The high rate of food insecurity in the US is hard to face. It means something is wrong. But we must confront that uncomfortable reality if we truly want to end hunger in the United States.   
Food security research has never been more important. So far, food shelf visits in 2025 have remained on par with the numbers we reported for 2024. Minnesotans are struggling with inflation and high costs for food and other essentials. At the same time, low-income Minnesotans are bracing for changes to SNAP that will create more barriers to accessing food support.   
More than ever, we need good national data to analyze the impact of federal policy changes and build a strong, strategic response to hunger. The Household Food Security Report is an irreplaceable tool in hunger-relief work. 
Abandoning it will only obscure the truth about food insecurity in the Unites States and impede efforts to create lasting change.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1368958566-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-16 07:56:50.778223

Lance Shockley, 48, was convicted by a jury for the 2005 murder of Missouri Highway Patrol Sgt. Carl Dewayne Graham Jr. A judge sentenced him to death in 2009.
That day in June, Summer and several other family members were invited inside the prison for a restoration visit, where families were given unusual access to the facility. 
They ate lunch and played pickleball. Later, the family clasped hands and prayed in a circle.
“It was just a really, really neat day,” said Summer, 27.

Deep down, though, she felt uneasy the entire time. Less than 30 minutes into her drive home, her dad called. Officials had set his execution for Oct. 14.
The experiences of children with parents on death row are often forgotten when it comes to capital punishment. There are few services for them, as they are not generally seen as victims. No organization tracks information on this particular group. Of the past 10 people who have faced execution in Missouri, at least six had children. 
Survivors who shared their stories described depression and grief they say could have been avoided, along with complicated feelings about the meaning of justice.
“When we talk about the collateral consequences of using the death penalty, they should be included in that count,” said Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. 
The impact Maher describes isn’t theoretical. Summer Shockley said she has lived it.
Summer said it was difficult as a child when kids heard about the killing and asked her about it. She credits her mom, who had split with Lance Shockley years before, for encouraging her and her younger sister to see him. They regularly went to Potosi.
“He just always told us how much he loved us and cared about us and how thankful he was that we could visit him and talk to him,” she said. 
They bonded over their faith in God. Over the past seven years, that faith has grown even stronger as Shockley became a leader in a prison ministry program. His awakening has transformed both sides of her family, she said, allowing them to be brought to Jesus and overcome generational challenges like alcohol and divorce. 
Now married and the head softball coach at Missouri University of Science and Technology, Summer has had time to think about the likely outcome of their relationship, especially as her father’s appeals waned. 
Confronted with the actual date, Summer said she’d been “living in grief prior to something tragic happening.” She made space to sit and let her emotions out. 
For months, she held onto hope that the execution would be called off. Her father maintained his innocence til the end, and even requested DNA testing on items found at the crime scene. Because this is the first execution under Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, anti-death penalty advocates also hoped the governor’s Catholic faith would influence his clemency decision. On Monday, Kehoe’s office announced he would not grant clemency.
Summer and her sister attended the execution at Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre — where the state’s executions take place — despite their dad’s initial reluctance.
Marcellus Williams, photographed in prison (photo submitted).
In the months after Marcellus “Khaliifah” Williams Sr. was executed in 2024, the younger Williams said he sank into a deep depression. 
The elder Williams was convicted in the 1998 murder of journalist Felicia Gayle in her University City home. He was sentenced to death in 2001.
The younger Williams said he often replayed the moment his father’s arm fell onto the gurney inside the chamber at Eastern Reception. The man who had once been his guide — the voice that talked him through matters of the heart and brain — was gone.
The execution was complicated by uncertainty. Officials with the prosecutor’s office who sent Williams Sr. to death row later tried to stop the execution because of questions about his guilt and a lack of DNA on the murder weapon. The victim’s family opposed the death penalty. The state moved forward, anyway. 
Williams Jr. said afterward, grief followed him everywhere. He often came across places in St. Louis that evoked memories of his dad, like the basketball courts at Walnut Park. He was negative and sometimes mean, he said. He didn’t seek professional help because of the cost, although he suspects he needed therapy even before the execution. 
The After Violence Project, which addresses the impact of mass incarceration and the death penalty on families, trains therapists through its Access to Treatment Initiative. Susannah Sheffer, the initiative’s director, said family members often experience “disenfranchised grief,” a kind of mourning that isn’t recognized or publicly supported.
The Rev. Jeff Hood, a spiritual adviser for men on death row, said children who are left behind face complicated emotions. Many families experience a disconnect until an execution date is set, prompting a rush to form a relationship.
Then, the parent dies.
In May, Williams Jr. was at a park with his 4-year-old son and found himself out of breath lifting the child onto a slide. After that, he began working out again. He knew he had to “shift out of it” for his son.

On New Year’s Day 2022, Khorry Ramey learned she was pregnant. Her father, Kevin Johnson, also called, warning that his life could soon end. She said she didn’t know how to process it.
That August, her aunt called to tell her an execution date had been set for Nov. 29.
“It was a reality check for me,” Ramey said. “Honestly, it was like, ‘This stuff still happens?’”
Johnson was sentenced to death in 2007 for the 2005 killing of Kirkwood Police Sgt. William McEntee.
Ramey had already known loss from a young age. Her father was arrested when she was 2, and her mother was murdered when she was 4.
She was only 19, but she wanted to attend the execution. State law required witnesses to be 21.
“I was like, if he was in a hospital bed, I’d be there by his side,” she said. “So it’s no different for me. It’s moreso like comforting my dad [in] his time of [need].
“And this is almost a closure for me as well.”
Johnson got to see his grandson several times, and even got to hold him once. Ramey’s last visit was the day of his execution. She had never seen him cry before then.
“He was just telling me how much he failed me as a father. The last memory I have of him is not what I want it to be.”
She tried therapy, but it wasn’t for her. Few understand what she’s been through, she said.
Although she learned at a young age what it was like to lose a parent, her dad’s death was harder. She grew up visiting him often, playing Connect 4 and Scrabble in the visitation room at Potosi. He got her report cards from school. They talked about everything.
When she’s in a dark place, Ramey said she focuses on her son. 
She is also steadfast in her belief that the death penalty is not “the Christian way to go about things.” Since her father’s execution, she’s attended other execution watches.

(Photo by Noelle Maxwell for Indiana Capital Chronicle)Since Jan. 20, organizations such as No Kings and 50501 have mobilized, holding regular protests against the second Trump administration. 
But big cities like Indianapolis and Fort Wayne aren’t the only communities where Hoosiers are exercising their First Amendment rights. People are gathering in Columbus, Batesville, Oldenburg, Franklin, Decatur and other small cities, towns and counties. 
This Saturday will once again bring a cascade of events around the state for the latest coordinated event. About 40 No Kings protests are planned for Indiana, from Albion to Vincennes. 
“I feel like a lot of people” who lean left, “and live somewhere like this, they may feel alone,” said Columbus resident Raven Stanton.
Stanton has organized several protests across Indiana and co-founded Rise Up Columbus. While she’s now considered a seasoned organizer, she didn’t get started until January. 
“I got online, found a couple Discord servers and connected with a handful of people locally,” she said. From there her involvement grew. 










I’m just not going to be silent. That was the problem in World War II — people stood by and did nothing.


– Sister Noella Poinsette


The current political situation motivated her actions, “the things that they’re attempting to do — the systematic removal of marginalized groups’ rights,” she elaborated, “their attempt at silencing journalists and other people and attempting to eradicate the First Amendment — that’s just the tip of the iceberg in terms of everything they’ve been able to accomplish in seven to eight months’ time.”
Hollie Payton, co-founder of Decatur County-based RISE for Justice echoed similar sentiments. 
“I felt with all the negativity going on, just to lend that ear, that piece of hope to people,” is important, she said, as is letting people know that while everyone is different, “we all deserve equal rights.”
Attorney and Indiana House District 55 Democratic candidate Victoria Martz has attended as many protests as possible. She got involved this spring after contacting another organizer in Decatur County, asking if she could speak at their protest. 
“I really wanted to talk to the people about what’s going on,” she said. “Everybody was having a difficult time coping with the fast-paced attacks on our constitutional rights, on our social service programs.”
She wanted to remind protestors that “it’s not the end – we’re in this together still and if we keep working together collectively, we can eventually, in time, change things. I still have faith in that.”
The Oldenburg Sisters of Saint Francis have participated in local and national protests, including the June 28 Sisters Speak Out protest in Washington D.C. Sister Noella Poinsette also attended a protest at Camp Atterbury.
Poinsette explained the Sisters’ involvement — “Saint Francis was all about the poor, just like Jesus. In the gospel — well, the gospel and the Old Testament, even — God says to care for the orphan, the widow and the stranger. Jesus was all about including everyone.” 

Indiana 50501 – which disbanded in August  – was organizing protests in Indianapolis. It stood for 50 protests, 50 states, 1 movement and has similar chapters nationwide. When contacted for comment, former leader Scott Johnson stated, “there were some people in the group that had some issue with me personally.” 
Johnson viewed his work as “servant-style leadership” and stepped down voluntarily. “I honestly don’t know who’s in charge or what they’re doing,” he said regarding the current status of Indiana 50501. The Indiana 50501 website homepage states “the original Indiana 50501 has disbanded,” listing groups continuing the original organization’s work.

The Sisters value justice and individual dignity. Participating in protests is how they speak out for those who can’t. 
“Maybe workers have a hard time speaking out for just wages because they need to be at work,” she said, “The immigrants right now in this climate are afraid to leave their homes sometimes. We’re just speaking up like the prophets in the Old Testament, trying to bring people back to an awareness of God.”
Rural protests don’t draw the same numbers as those at the Statehouse. For instance, a No Kings rally in May drew more than 3,000 to the state’s capital. Some of the other protests draw dozens to more than a hundred.
Martz described people who drive past protests in small communities as mostly positive, “they’re honking their horns, doing like a cheering fist or waving, things that show they’re happy to see this going on.”
But there are some people “who drive by and they’re throwing up the middle finger or yelling ‘Trump won.’ Nobody said he didn’t win. We’re just saying we don’t like authoritarianism.”
While helping organize a protest in Batesville, Martz was responsible for coordinating with local law enforcement. That communication paid off because at this protest, there was an incident. Martz and her group were walking from downtown Batesville to another area to listen to a speaker. While walking, a truck with two large Trump flags kept driving ahead of the group. The driver was yelling at protestors.
The group approached an intersection and the truck pulled up to the stop sign. The group had previously informed the police chief they wouldn’t obstruct traffic. Organizers reminded protestors to let traffic pass. The truck wouldn’t move, even as other cars approached and waited. 
“We were not going to cross the street,” Martz said, “because I was afraid of what could happen if we crossed in front of this truck that already made it clear he wasn’t liking what we’re there to stand for.”
The truck began slowly rolling through the intersection, the driver still yelling at the group. Two protestors approached, Martz said, yelling back, while she reminded others to remain on the sidewalk. 
“As I’m doing that,” she recounts, “a white truck pulls up — facing the opposite direction. It flips on its lights and it’s the police chief. He rolled down his window,” telling the truck’s driver he was blocking traffic.  
“He made the truck move,” Martz said, “and de-escalated the situation alongside me.” 
The group was able to cross and listen to their speaker. The moment stood out, said Martz, because it showed everybody, “your community, while it might not be a straight Democratic community, a good community can have people of all political identities and backgrounds who stand behind each other.”

In Greensburg, Payton encountered locals and people from nearby communities at protests. One woman, who had never attended a protest before, went on to attend multiple. 
“That just solidified the purpose of our movement,” Payton said, “letting people know that what we feel is going on in this country, state, is wrong and we can voice our opinion in a non-violent manner and build community.”
Stanton observed she’s seen “more flak, negative flak, online than I ever have in-person,” at protests she’s organized.
For the Sisters of Saint Francis, reactions have been positive. 
“People are really glad that we, as women, religious sisters, are out there voicing their values and concerns. Naturally, there have been some who are opposed to it,” Poinsette said
Beyond protesting, the Sisters of Saint Francis have displayed banners on their front lawn since 2019, including a Black Lives Matter banner. Another time the banner welcomed refugees and immigrants.
Despite some negative encounters, Martz believes protesting is powerful, “even if we’re not changing minds of people who are very set on what they believe,” it ensures people who are upset with what’s going on feel less alone.
“Just because we live in an area represented by Republicans doesn’t mean everybody out here is a Republican,” Martz added, noting rural Indiana isn’t a monolith.

Besides raising awareness many groups hold collection drives at protests to give back. Stanton collects food and hygiene products at her protests to “give something tangible” to the community.” Martz and her fellow organizers have tried to include food drives at every protest to ensure “we’re giving back to the community,” especially as programs like SNAP are cut.
“Nothing will be any different if we don’t take action,” Poinsette said when asked what she felt has been achieved via protesting. 
Paraphrasing activist and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, she added, “silence only benefits the oppressor. If I am silent, I’m saying it’s okay that ICE is acting the way they’re acting and it’s not okay. I don’t want all this. I don’t want health care ending. What the Republicans are doing, in cutting money for Medicaid, is going to be the end of a good number of rural hospitals. All the money through that bill [H.R. 119] that they’ve given to the ultra-rich and programs they’re taking away from ordinary people; all of that is wrong. It’s against the gospel, it’s against what God wants for each of us.
“I’m not going to just be quiet and let that happen,” Poinsette said. “I’m only one person but it’s not going to happen. I’m not going to act like I’m okay with it. Whether anything happens because of this — I’m just not going to be silent. That was the problem in World War II — people stood by and did nothing.”

Before (left) and after (right) photos of the mudslide and cleanup on State Route 20 following an Aug. 11 mudslide. (Washington State Department of Transportation)State transportation officials say they are making the limited dollars for highway and bridge preservation stretch as far as they can — but it’s not far enough.
There’s too little money to keep up with repaving roads, repairing aging spans and responding to emergency fixes.
“We are in the early stages of critical failure due to lack of funding,” Troy Suing, director of capital program development and management for Washington State Department of Transportation, told a state panel Tuesday.
“We are doing everything we can to squeeze out as much service life as we can,” he told members of the Washington State Transportation Commission. “We are underfunded. We are forced to be reactive when we look at our assets right now.”
It’s going to take billions of dollars to handle the maintenance and preservation backlog, and “significant additional investment” to get ahead, Suing said in a sobering presentation echoing past messages of agency leaders.
Two years ago, Roger Millar, then department secretary, warned the state transportation system was “on a glidepath to failure” due to continued underfunding of preservation of highways and bridges. Former Gov. Jay Inslee voiced similar concerns, saying lawmakers dumped too much money into new projects in recent years and too little into preserving existing roads.
Earlier this year, the Legislature approved a two-year $15.5 billion budget with $900 million for preservation for the next two years, well shy of the $1.6 billion transportation officials estimated is required to keep pace with regular wear and tear.
Suing, the transportation department official, cataloged some of the challenges.
He said 40% of the state’s lane miles, about 7,900, were due or overdue for paving in 2024. Of those, 670 miles got paved.
This year, the agency decided to spend most of its paving budget in the first half of the biennium, creating a gap when the 2026 construction season arrives. It is preparing to carry out $170 million of additional paving next year, but the work hinges on getting additional funding in the preservation program.
Bridges are another story. Of Washington’s 3,427 spans, 10% are more than 80 years old. 
Suing emphasized that “if they’re open, they’re safe” to drive on. That doesn’t mean they don’t need attention. For example, of the roughly 100 steel bridges due for painting, fewer than 10 got done in 2024.
When an emergency occurs that potentially requires closure, the effects ripple through communities.
A semitruck crash in August caused millions of dollars in damage to the White River Bridge connecting eastern King and Pierce counties. As repairs began, the span was entirely closed for weeks, then reopened to alternating traffic. It is expected to fully reopen in the coming weeks.
On the other hand, the Carbon River Bridge won’t reopen anytime soon. In April, the state permanently closed the 103-year-old structure on State Route 165 due to severe, unexpected deterioration of its steel supports. It provided access to Mount Rainier National Park’s Mowich Lake Entrance, Carbon River Ranger Station and other outdoor recreation areas.
“When we don’t preserve the system, it affects everybody,” Suing said. “This is a long-term commitment. There is no short-term fix when it comes to bridges.”
Last month, Washington State Department of Transportation Secretary Julie Meredith sketched the agency’s multi-billion-dollar need in her formal submission for the 2026 supplemental budget. She didn’t ask her boss, Gov. Bob Ferguson, for more money to address unfunded and underfunded “critical needs.” 
In a Sept. 15 letter, she explained that her budget request reflects “a constrained approach” that sought funds only for such things as fuel rate changes and utility and insurance cost increases that occurred since adoption of the biennial spending plan in April.
But she included two documents showing that nearly $1.5 billion more per year is needed for preservation, operations and maintenance, and safety programs collectively. And billions more on top of that are required to keep Washington State Ferries afloat and to remove or replace culverts that pose barriers for migrating salmon.
“Critical needs remain unfunded,” she wrote. In the area of preservation alone, she warned that decades of underfunding “put the health of our existing [transportation] system in jeopardy” and led to “more frequent and severe failures and diverting resources to emergency fixes.“",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/highway-20-august-2024-mudslide-1024x558.jpg,,,2025-10-16 07:56:50.778223

This story by Phil Dodd was first published in The Bridge on Oct. 14, 2025
In hopes of securing a state flood grant to help rebuild the one road into Montpelier’s Country Club Road — an estimated $7.2 million project — the city is rushing to recruit developers to buy some or all of the property. To that end, city council has once again hired consultant White + Burke to help.
It remains uncertain whether the city will be able to recruit a developer in time — even if, as suggested by White + Burke, it offers to sell the property for $1. Nor is it clear whether the state will have any grant money left to fund a tentatively planned second round of grants this winter.
Planning Director Mike Miller. said that originally, the city planned to file the application by the grant’s Sept. 30 first round deadline, but paused after the state said it wanted “shovel-ready” projects. With the ultimate goal of bringing housing to the site, the city council formed a subcommittee to find a developer before the unconfirmed second round of grant funding.
Under the grant terms, a developer should focus on building lower income housing, likely rentals or shared-equity homes. To meet federal requirements, a total of 70% of the state’s flood grants have to benefit low- and moderate-income households, which have 80% or less of the county’s area median income. In Washington County, that amounts to $70,240 or less.
The state has $64.7 million to award in grants, but requests in the first round of funding are about double that amount. This has raised the question of whether there will be any money left for a second round.
“We are very confident that there will be a second round [of funding],” Miller noted in an Oct. 3 email. “We have had more than one state official confirm that they expect a second round.”
But Housing and Community Development Deputy Commissioner Nate Formalarie told The Bridge that since the first round was “oversubscribed,” the state will have to analyze the first round of applications before reaching any conclusions.
“We have decided to push back determination on if there will be a round two,” he said. “We will make a determination on round two and announce that decision and application timelines in early 2026.”
In the meantime, the city is pushing ahead. In order to recruit a developer and apply for the grant, it has signed another contract with consultants White + Burke. Montpelier has already paid White + Burke about $500,000 for prior planning on the same project, and the firm has also consulted on Montpelier’s downtown TIF district, now disbanded, and a public parking garage project, since failed.
The motion to sign the new one-year contract narrowly passed at the city council’s Oct. 8 meeting, with Mayor Jack McCullough voting in favor: Cary Brown, Sal Alfano and Ben Doyle also voted in favor; Pelin Kohn abstained; Jim Sheridan had left the meeting prior to the vote; Adrienne Gil voted against it. The vote came after an extended executive session about the contract that contributed to the meeting going until almost midnight.
Steve Whitaker, a city critic who believes Montpelier needs to do more of its own planning, said the contract had not been made public before the vote and that the work had not been put out to bid to anyone other than White + Burke. 
The now-public contract — titled “Exclusive Right to Market Agreement” — states that White + Burke have “exclusive right, power and authority to act as Owner’s real estate agent for the listing, marketing, sale or exchange of the Property.”
The city will pay White + Burke for listing and selling the property in two ways, first in an amount “not to exceed $50,000 without prior Owner authorization.” And second, if within 10 years of a closing Country Club Road is developed such that its taxable value reaches $5 million or more, White + Burke gets 3% of that value, not to exceed $300,000. A cover memo from White + Burke notes the contract does not include detailed project planning, including how to negotiate a purchase and sale agreement and prepare a financing strategy.
Earlier this fall, White + Burke principal David White warned city councilors that Country Club Road is “not an easy project” and it was possible that no developer would come forward.  But he also said, “this can work,” and cited significant increases in the grand list his firm helped achieve in downtown St. Albans.
Even before the contract was signed, White + Burke employee Stephanie Clarke had been working with the council’s Country Club Road subcommittee at a rate of $250 per hour. The current timeline, which Clarke called “ambitious,” has the subcommittee developing a Request for Qualifications by Oct. 16. 
Later, in December, the city would issue a final Request for Proposal (RFP), which would lead to choosing one developer or a team of developers. Miller has recommended the RFP focus on the “lower ten acres” of the total 30 acres of developable land.
Clarke suggested that to attract developers, the city should “strongly consider” offering to sell the property for $1 and possibly waive city permit fees and sewer and water hook-up fees.
The city purchased the land for $3 million for recreation and housing purposes about three years ago after voters approved the idea by a 54% to 46% margin. As the project has dragged on, some councilors and residents have called for selling the property, but for now the council is trying to facilitate housing development.
Earlier this year, the councilors settled on the infrastructure work they hope will be funded by grants and allow development to take place. The infrastructure plan was based on work by Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc., which the city hired under a $110,000 design contract.
The $7.2 million infrastructure project includes installing new water and sewer pipes from the nearby roundabout to the top of Country Club Road, raising a section of U.S. Route 2 as much as three feet to allow a better connection with the road, relocating the road to align with the right-of-way, and reducing the grade of the road to 12%, still steeper than the current city standard for new roads.
The city is applying this month for a $3 million “Catalyst” grant from the Northern Border Regional Commission to pay for a portion of the work. If that grant is successful, the city will apply for $4.2 million in the tentatively planned second round of the state flood grant funding. If not, it will apply for the full $7.2 million from the state in the second round, if there is one, according to officials.

(Ron Cogswell | used by permission of the photographer)University of Wisconsin campuses could be limited in their ability to raise tuition under two Republican bills that received a hearing in the Senate Universities and Technical Colleges committee. One would leverage tuition freezes on campuses as a penalty for free speech violations, while the other would aim to help with affordability for students and families by capping tuition increases.
With the conclusion of the budget process over the summer and a $250 million investment in the UW system, Democratic and Republican lawmakers have recently turned their attention to potential policy changes that could be made to the higher education system in Wisconsin. Democratic lawmakers announced their own proposals for helping with higher education costs last week.
Implementing financial penalties on UW, technical colleges for free speech violations
Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) said her bill would enshrine the principle of current University of Wisconsin system policy in law to clarify and protect the First Amendment rights of students, staff and visitors. 
Current UW system policy includes its commitment to freedom of speech and expression along with some accountability measures including conduct and due process mechanisms to address violations. 
A similar bill passed the Assembly in 2023, but failed to receive a vote in the Senate. Earlier versions of the policy were introduced after a controversial survey of UW campuses that found that a majority of students who responded said they were afraid to express views on certain issues in class. The survey had an average response rate of 12.5% across all UW System campuses. 
The latest iteration of the bill was introduced just six days after the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, who has become a recurring point of discussion and debate. Lawmakers passed a resolution this week to honor his life.
Nedweski noted that another survey by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) that found that 35% of students say using violence to stop someone from speaking on campus is acceptable at least in rare cases. The survey included responses from 423 people. 
“It’s clearly even more chilling in light of the recent political assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk on a college campus. When we accept the false premise that speech is equivalent to violence, we allow violence to replace speech as a means of debate… We’ve seen many of our college campuses devolve into marketplaces of fear of certain viewpoints,” Nedweski said. “While Charlie Kirk’s assassination on the college campus is the most extreme example of this, it is not the first time conservatives on campus have been threatened or intimidated for their views.” 
Nedweski said the bill would help restore trust.
“The breakdown in public trust is real. It will only get worse unless our colleges and universities get serious about restoring intellectual diversity on campus, I believe,” Nedweski said. 
SB 498 would bar UW institutions from restricting speech from a speaker if their conduct “is not unlawful and does not materially and substantially disrupt the functioning of the UW institution or technical college.” It would also restrict enforcement of time, place and manner restrictions on expressive activities in public forum spaces, designating any place a “free speech zone,” charging security fees as a part of a permit application and sanctioning people for discriminatory harassment unless the speech “targets its victim on the basis of a protected class under law, and is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively bars a student from receiving equal access to educational opportunities or benefits.” 
If an institution is found to violate the provisions by a state or federal court, then it would receive a notice and a person whose expressive rights were violated would be able to bring action against the UW Board of Regents or a technical college board. A plaintiff could be awarded damages of at least $500 for the initial violation plus $50 for each day after the complaint was filed and the violation continues up to $100,000. A plaintiff could also be awarded court costs and reasonable attorney fees. 
Students, employees and campus organizations would have a due process guarantee under the bill. If the due process provisions are violated more than once in a five-year period, a campus would be required to freeze tuition for all students for the following two academic years.
Nedweski said she hadn’t spoken with the UW system about the legislation this session, but she is open to conversations. 
“I’ve expressed it from the start of the session for the UW to come and work with us on this to get to a place where they can be a thumbs up, but I haven’t heard from anyone,” Nedweski said. “They will express some concerns about certain language in the bill and definitions, and I’d like to say today that, of course, the door is still open.”
UW Interim Vice President of University Relations Chris Patton that the system’s concerns with the bills center on the penalties. 
Patton said the penalty of freezing state funding would put the system’s financial health at risk — and potentially compromise the system’s ability to carry out its mission of being a “marketplace of ideas.” 
“Freedom of expression and free speech is not just a constitutional principle. It’s at the very core of what makes our universities thrive,” Patton said. “The First Amendment guarantees this right, and our institutions take seriously our responsibility to uphold it for all students, faculty, staff, visitors and stakeholders at the Universities of Wisconsin. We already have really robust policies and procedures in place.”
Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara (R-Appleton), a coauthor on the bill, urged lawmakers to “please understand” that the bill is “not to punish any of our institutions,” but is to “ensure that they’re following what’s already in the Bill of Rights.”
Sen. Chis Larson (D-Milwaukee), the top Democrat on the committee, expressed concern about the aims of the legislation, whether free speech was a top concern that was widespread on campuses and whether the bill could bolster harmful language. 
“I appreciate you guys coming up here to embrace DEI for Republican viewpoints, which this seems to be what this bill is all about — making sure that Republican viewpoints are more represented and encouraged and being inclusive to that,” Larson said. 
“You can call it DEI for conservatism, but there’s nothing in the bill that addresses anything specific to conservatives, liberals, Republicans, Democrats,” Nedweski replied. “It’s free speech protections for everyone.”
Larson noted that he represents the UW-Milwaukee campus and often speaks with students about their concerns and free speech is typically low on the list. He said he hears concerns about affordability and safety more frequently. 
“Other concerns include safety, especially for students who are LGBTQ, students who are of a different race than Caucasian, of their safety on campus, of being targeted with hate crimes,” Larson said. 
Larson also brought up a recent Politico article, which exposed racist messages sent into a group chat of Young Republicans, to ask whether lawmakers thought their bill could encourage that type of speech. 
Larson said he wasn’t concerned with self-censorship that discouraged people from “saying these racist, homophobic, xenophobic, glorification of rape things out in the public, because that is something that in a free and open society should have consequences associated with it.”
“We do not have the exemption for hate speech in our laws and in the First Amendment. It does not exempt hate speech,” Larson said. “It seems to me that this [bill] would pave the way to be able to say, yes, that would be something that is not only allowed on campus, but encouraged.” 
Nedweski said she was not concerned that the bill would “further unhinge people.” 
“We’re all concerned about the political temperature that has risen so high in this country,” Nedweski said. “I don’t have concerns this bill is going to push anybody overboard. The intent is to protect people whether I agree with what their ideas… are or not. I have no association with the group that you’re talking about. I don’t agree with the things that they said. It’s unfortunate that that happened.”
Capping tuition increases
Under SB 399, the UW Board of Regents would be prohibited from increasing undergraduate tuition by more than the consumer price index increase in a given year. 
The bill, coauthored by Sen. Andre Jacque (R-New Franken) and Rep. Dave Murphy (R-Hortonville), was introduced this year after the UW system adopted its third consecutive tuition increase in July. The increases were a maximum of 5% for each campus and were implemented after the recent state budget did not reach the requests the system said would be needed to avoid a hike. 
“With the continued rising prices in almost every area of the economy, some increase in resident tuition is to be expected but we must set common sense guardrails so that any price increases are reasonable, ensuring the UW system remains a cost-effective option for Wisconsin families,” Jacque said. 
Jacque said the recent hike “might be the impetus for the timing this session” but he has seen it as a “reasonable policy” for a while, noting that versions of the bill have been proposed in previous years.
Murphy said he thought the legislation would make it so that lawmakers don’t “have to always be looking” at tuition.
“It’s just up and down and up and down and up and down,” Murphy said. The bill, he added, would help provide a semblance of predictability down the line. “If you have a youngster in the K-12 system and you’re looking at what college is going to cost in the future, you could probably have a good idea of where it is going to go.”
Larson said he found it “noble” what the Republican lawmakers were trying to accomplish with the bill, but asked about why there wasn’t any state contribution included in the bill.
He noted that the portion of state funding that makes up the UW system’s budget has been decreasing over many years. 
“It’s like the cost of groceries,” Larson said, comparing it to “shrinkflation,” a form of inflation where the price of a product stays the same but the size or quantity of a product is reduced. “We’re gonna freeze the cost of a loaf of bread, and then year after year, you’re going to get one slice less, one slice less, one slice less. It will still be the same cost, but you’re getting less. I worry… if you freeze it, we’re going to be getting the equivalent of one slice less every single year in terms of what the deliverable is from the University.” 
Murphy noted that the legislation would just cap increases, not freeze tuition.

Later, when a co-worker asked him why he did nothing, Williams told him the truth.
“I said, ‘No offense, but I only get paid one time, and that is to be a stocker,’” said Williams, who today makes $11.50 an hour filling shelves with diapers, ramen and discount shampoo at a New Orleans store. Some months, he said, he can’t make rent. ”So, sorry, I’m not about to put my life on the line,” he told his colleague.
What Williams needed, he thought, was a better job. He wasn’t looking to unionize his workplace — a tall order in the right-to-work South. He just needed things to change.
In 2022, Williams joined an organization that seemed, to him, like his best shot: Step Up Louisiana. Like several successful campaigns before it, Step Up organizes workers to improve their jobs, but stops short of calling for a union under the National Labor Relations Board. The approach, sometimes referred to as “premajority unionism,” is a natural fit for places like the South, with histories of public hostility to unions. Today, suggest experts, it may also be workers’ best bet for building power amid the hostility of the Trump administration.

The United States is home to 20,700 Dollar Generals, 8,000 Family Dollars and 9,000 Dollar Trees.
“Anywhere there’s a dollar store, from here to California to New York, the working conditions are the same, unfortunately,” said Kenya Slaughter, a lead organizer with Step Up. Founded in 2017, the group — which has no official ties to any union — organizes grassroots members around economic justice issues in Louisiana and Tennessee.
“We’re not against unions,” she said, but starting off with a demand for one, she explained, doesn’t make sense given the dollar store model.
“We’re all fighting for the same thing,” said Williams. “You know you’re sick and tired of how you’re being treated.”
Williams, like most workers in the dollar store campaign, complains of short-staffing; researchers say Dollar General employs an average of eight employees per store. Other complaints include constant turnover; low wages; crumbling and filthy stores; and security so poor that several workers have been slain on the job.
Dollar General did not answer questions about wages or its treatment of workers, but said in a statement, “Ultimately, we strive to create a work environment where employees have opportunities to grow their careers, serve their local communities and feel valued and heard.”

The traditional remedy for workers like Williams has been to organize a union, including filing for an NLRB election, a process standardized in the 90-year-old National Labor Relations Act. But the act was not written with the 15.6 million U.S. retail workers in mind.
“The NLRB works best for single-site companies with one clear owner,” said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research and a senior lecturer at Cornell University.
While most dollar stores have a single corporate owner, their workers are spread in tiny clusters across the country. Under U.S. labor law, each dollar store would have to unionize individually, or face the additional challenge of an election across multiple stores. Today, only 4% of retail workers in the U.S. are unionized. That is even lower than the private sector average of just under 6%.
Even before the second Trump administration, Bronfenbrenner said, the National Labor Relations Board had evolved over decades into an agency with little enforcement power.
“Before we basically dismantled the regulatory state, which is what’s happening now, the NLRB could force an election, but they can’t force a contract because there’s no penalty for employers who refuse to bargain other than a piece of paper saying, ‘Go bargain.’” she said.
Employers have long dragged out negotiations with impunity, with first contracts taking an average of 459 days to negotiate. Indeed, workers at Starbucks and Amazon won NLRB union elections in 2021 and 2022, respectively. They have yet to get a contract — and the improvements to their jobs one would bring.
The NLRB’s limitations are no secret to unions — even those successful in organizing under it. “If your campaign is relying on the National Labor Relations Act, you will not win because the employer knows how to defeat it,” said Kurt Petersen, co-president of Unite Here Local 11. His 32,000 member union has grown by strategically pressuring employers into agreeing to remain neutral during organizing drives and to recognize unions under card check. (Disclosure: Unite Here is a financial supporter of Capital & Main.)
The National Labor Relations Board has become even more challenging for workers since Donald Trump reassumed office, said Bronfenbrenner. “It’s totally dysfunctional,” she said of the agency. It has effectively been paused since January, when Trump fired Biden appointee Gwynne Wilcox from the board. The move left it without the quorum required to issue decisions. In the months since, at least one anti-union law firm has begun instructing clients to consider resuming illegal captive-audience meetings, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the NLRB’s authority is unconstitutional, further eroding the agency’s legal status.
Indeed, after a surge in NLRB elections under President Joe Biden, the rate of workers unionizing appears to have plummeted since Trump reassumed office, according to National Labor Relations Board data analyzed by Kevin Reuning, a political scientist at Miami University of Ohio. In the first nine months of 2024, 80,434 workers formed new unions, according Reuning’s site, Unionelections.org. During the same period a year later, only 47,085 workers had done so.

For Mckenzie Midgette, a four-year Dollar General veteran who now works full-time organizing dollar store workers in Tennessee, the situation is clear. The NLRB is not going to save dollar store workers. Instead, she said, “We need to learn how to [organize] ourselves.”
In New Orleans, Step Up’s organizing yielded raises in local stores after about 18 months. After launching their campaign in mid-2020, workers held rallies, marched on Dollar General’s annual shareholder meeting and took their plight to the media. In 2023, Dollar Tree (which at the time owned Family Dollar) announced national wage increases of up to 25%, raising wages by $2 an hour; Step Up says Louisiana Dollar Generals followed suit. The following year, Dollar General approved a proposal that Williams made at a shareholder meeting that called for a company-wide safety audit.
But there are limits to how much workers can achieve without a union, cautioned Bronfenbrenner. Without a contract guaranteeing basic work conditions and a voice for workers, every improvement can be taken away without notice.
“The goal of this whole thing is to change workers’ lives, and that’s done by having a union contract in the workplace.” said Local 11’s Petersen.
Moving forward, experts say workers are going to have to work outside of NLRB elections to improve their jobs. “That absolutely has to happen,” said Bronfenbrenner. And in some places, it already is.
In the Carolinas, Alabama and Georgia, another worker group called the Union of Southern Service Workers (backed by the Service Employees International Union) has been organizing retail workers (including dollar store workers), workers at low-paying restaurants like Waffle House, and home health care aides. After demanding $25 an hour and safer working conditions, and staging walkouts, they saw success at Waffle House. Last June, the company announced a pay increase from $2.13 an hour to $5.25 an hour by 2026. (Disclosure: SEIU is a financial supporter of Capital & Main.)
In New York City, app-based delivery workers, typically classified as independent contractors and therefore without the right to organize an NLRB union, have also had success without calling for a union. In 2023, two years of intense organizing by Los Deliveristas Unidos yielded a new city law mandating a $21.44 (as of 2025) minimum wage for app-based restaurant delivery workers. This year, the law was expanded to include grocery app delivery workers.
These nontraditional campaigns are only likely to become more appealing given the Trump administration’s current posture, said Jennifer Abruzzo, general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board during the Biden administration.
“Workers are taking matters into their own hands,” she said. “The board isn’t functioning, and workers are educated about their rights and recognize their power. You’re going to see unions and workers, even without unions, perhaps not filing charges with the NLRB, but taking up the issue themselves by ticketing or protesting or striking.”

(Getty Images)Indiana education officials on Wednesday unveiled major updates to the state’s proposed school accountability system — including new reading and “back on track” indicators — as they work to finalize rules that will replace the state’s former A-F grading model by the end of the year.
The presentation to the State Board of Education marked the second draft of the overhaul first released in June. Under a state law passed earlier this year, the Indiana Department of Education must deliver a final plan by Dec. 31 that aligns school ratings with the state’s “Graduates Prepared to Succeed,” or Indiana GPS, framework.
“This is critically important public policy for education in Indiana,” said Ron Sandlin, IDOE’s chief innovation officer. “What we’ve built is a model that values both academic mastery and the knowledge, skills and experiences that make up a student’s full story — not just a test score.”
The latest proposal keeps the state’s A-F letter grade scale but revises how those grades are calculated. 
Schools would earn points based on each student’s academic achievement and additional indicators such as attendance, literacy progress, work-based learning and credential attainment.
Sandlin said the revision “creates more consistency” in how points are awarded and simplifies the system so that “the average Hoosier can look at it and feel comfortable.”
Measuring every student
A central change to the proposal is what Sandlin and Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner described as an “n of one” model in which school quality is evaluated based on the outcomes of each individual student rather than aggregated percentages.
“Every single student matters,” Sandlin told the board. “Their success as an individual should inform school success — not the averages of large groups where individual stories get lost.”
Jenner added that Indiana is “forging ahead” by measuring both academic mastery and real-world skills. 
“Please call us on it,” she said. “Academic mastery, assessment and accountability matter in Indiana — regardless of what the federal government does or does not do — but there are other things that matter as well.”
Jenner also pushed back against critics who argue the approach softens academic expectations.

“There is a movement around the country lowering cut scores,” the education secretary said. “Indiana is standing firm. We have a tough assessment. We just believe there’s more to a child than if they pass or fail a test.”
Cindy Long, executive director of the Indiana Association of School Principals, said her group supports the latest changes, especially the grade 12 shift toward diploma seals. She also praised revisions that allows schools to earn credit in other ways even if they don’t meet attendance goals.
Board member Byron Ernest called the asset-based approach “awesome,” saying it will finally let data “tell a story” about each learner. 
Board member Erika Dilosa additionally stressed that the new framework “isn’t punitive” but “creates opportunities for students that may have been overlooked in the past because they didn’t quite fit.”
Addressing concerns — and pushing for progress
Still, board member Kathleen Mote worried how the term “approaching proficiency” might be interpreted, and said the terminology might signal the opposite to parents and the public.
“We are using the same labels for these things, but now they have very different definitions, and there is dissonance there that we have to figure out how to resolve,” she noted.
Indiana unveils first draft of overhauled school accountability system to replace A-F grades

Sandlin responded that the department will review the terminology to ensure it clearly communicates student progress but made clear that schools “will not earn maximum points” for students who “are not proficient.”
“We want to encourage progress,” Sandlin told Mote. “If you’re ‘approaching proficient,’ but you’re making enough progress to eventually reach proficiency, it does earn you maximum points. We’ve inherently built in … an incentive for schools to help (students) reach that next step, and to receive the credit as (a student) makes the necessary progress to get there.”
Sandlin emphasized that the model “does not take the gas pedal off,” even as students improve, “because we know there’s more (they) can do.”
Board member Scott Bess addressed other concerns that the new accountability model might be softening academic standards by placing less emphasis on high-stakes test scores.
He acknowledged that some national experts have argued that Indiana may be lowering expectations — and said some of the state’s education partners “will be chippy on this one” — but made it clear the state intends to “stand firm” on its approach.
“There is a body of thought out there that says, ‘Nope. It’s are you proficient, or are you not? And that’s it.’ And if you deviate from that, then you’re somehow lowering standards, or you’re excusing people and passing them through,” Bess said.
“This model … is making sure that each student is achieving something,” he added. “The field clearly believes that this is a step in the right direction.”
‘Put(ing) our money where our mouths are’
The first draft of the proposed accountability rule, unveiled in June, tied school ratings to the Indiana GPS system, emphasizing literacy and math in early grades, work-based learning and credentials in high school, and a mix of academic mastery and skill development indicators across grade levels. 
Officials said that draft sought to capture a fuller picture of student performance beyond test scores but left some details undefined, especially around how certain skills and benchmarks would be measured.

In response to months of feedback, the second draft adds several new and clarified indicators designed to better reflect student growth and school effort, Sandlin said.
A new “Accelerated Literacy” measure gives schools credit when students flagged as “at risk” on the second-grade IREAD exam later pass it in third grade — a change meant to reward successful reading interventions. 
A companion “Adolescent Reading” indicator extends that recognition to upper elementary grades, too, allowing schools to earn points when students who failed the IREAD later demonstrate proficiency in grades 4 through 6.
At the high school level, a “Back on Track” indicator acknowledges schools that help ninth-graders who fall behind on credits catch up by the end of 10th grade. Another draft adjustment provides flexibility for biology testing, letting schools earn points for students who complete the end-of-course biology assessment in any grade — fixing a technical issue that previously credited only those who took it in grade 10.
For grade 12, new Indiana Diploma seals — which reflect whether students meet college, employment or service “recipes for success” — would further serve as the universal outcome for graduation, Sandlin noted. 
That benchmark would replace the SAT as the central measure of high school performance and instead align the new accountability model with the state’s new graduation and diploma requirements.










Every single student matters. Their success as an individual should inform school success — not the averages of large groups where individual stories get lost.


– Ron Sandlin, IDOE’s chief innovation officer


“We’ve said that there are multiple pathways to success,” Sandlin said. “This shift puts our money where our mouths are. And it says, if you earn an honor seal, or if you earn an honors plus seal, you are on track for success.”
The rule also formalizes a transition period through the class of 2028 so current students earning Core 40 diplomas are not penalized before the new diploma and seals take effect.
Next steps towards adoption
Indiana’s school accountability grades have been in flux for years.
The state’s A-F rating system has been effectively suspended since 2018 due to transitions in state testing and COVID-related disruptions.
During the pause, schools instead received performance report cards posted online. The cards offered data on test scores, graduation rates, attendance, and postsecondary readiness, but stopped short of assigning a single letter grade.

The shift to an updated model is part of a broader effort mandated by House Enrolled Act 1498, signed into law earlier this year. The legislation, authored by Rep. Bob Behning, R-Indianapolis, requires the state education board to adopt a new school accountability model by the end of December, with implementation beginning in the 2026–27 school year. 
Education officials said the overhaul aims to merge elements of the previous accountability model with a simpler, more transparent grading system that parents can understand — and that focuses less on “penalizing” schools.
“We want a model that encourages schools to focus on improvement for each individual student — our n size is 1,” Sandlin said. “Because every single student’s story deserves to count.”
The second 30-day public comment period opened immediately after Wednesday’s meeting and will run through Nov. 17, when a public hearing is scheduled at the Indiana State Library. 
IDOE staff said the department  expects to bring a final accountability rule to the board in December for adoption.
“We’ve tried to build a model that is inclusive of more elements that we believe matter. And we very, very humbly, in Indiana, want to hear constructive feedback from partners,” Jenner said. “It would be easy for us to immediately build a pass-fail system. … We just believe we have to look at the full child picture. We have to think about education differently. The status quo is not getting us anywhere.”
Jenner said another round of public comments will be “so important” as the board gets closer to final adoption.
“We’ll probably have a few tweaks here and there before we land it,” she said, “and that’s exactly why this process matters.”

(Getty Images)Editor’s Note: This story discusses child abuse and neglect and may be upsetting to readers. 
Programs in Idaho that support foster children have unique challenges across the regions, but lately, nearly all of them are reporting the same problem — children seem to be entering the state’s care with increasingly complex cases. 
Some of those cases involve much more severe abuse and neglect than in past years, according to interviews with multiple advocates for foster youth. 
“During the course of all of our 30 years up here in the First Judicial District, there were maybe a handful of aggravated (abuse and neglect) cases,” said District 1 Court Appointed Special Advocates Director of Development Kristin Linville Ludwig. “This year, we have had four in the First Judicial District alone. So that’s bad, and nobody wants that to happen.” 
Advocates point to several factors contributing to this. One factor includes an early 2024 Idaho court decision that appeared to prompt a steep decline in child removals and entry into foster care by law enforcement.

From 2015 to 2023, the average number of foster care entries initiated by law enforcement was around 948 per year, according to data from Health and Welfare. In fiscal year 2024, there were 633 entries by police. In fiscal year 2025, which ended June 30, the number was 263.
Other factors include isolation from the COVID-19 pandemic, and federal and state policies that emphasize more on prevention and reunification with biological parents, several foster child advocates said.
Children in foster care are represented by a trained volunteer Court Appointed Special Advocate, or CASA, and each judicial district in Idaho has a program to train and support these volunteers. The Idaho Capital Sun spoke to leaders from all but one district CASA program; the East Idaho District 7 office could not be reached by publication time.  
Linville Ludwig oversees the program in North Idaho, which has seen a decline in the number of children entering the system but she said her volunteers have noticed an increase in complexity of cases.

As of Sept. 23, there were 1,172 foster children in Idaho, down slightly from 1,400 children at the end of June last year.
Jean Fisher — administrator of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Division of Youth Safety and Permanency and former longtime Ada County prosecutor who specialized in crimes against children — said she’s also seen a rise in complexity. 
“Whether that is both mental health, behavioral health, and the type of abuse and physical abuse that they have endured, I think all of it is much higher than it used to be,” Fisher said. 
 Advocates: Pandemic one of the factors in the severity of child protection cases  

The reasons for the increasing severity are hard to track, but multiple CASA leaders told the Sun that the COVID-19 pandemic and isolation seemed to have a lasting effect. 
“Coming out of COVID, we started to see some really frightening things more regularly than we had been,” District 6 CASA Executive Director Lesli Schei said. 
Schei’s district covers Bannock, Bear Lake, Caribou, Franklin, Oneida and Power counties. 
She said with children not going to school and spending more time in their home, there weren’t as many other adults able to report suspected cases. If a child is being abused in the home, it tends to worsen over time, she said. 
“It was a very stressful time to work in child protection,” Schei said. “And I think that trend somewhat has continued.” 
Fisher also said the pandemic hampered child protection efforts. 
“For kids who have been experiencing severe abuse or neglect, not only is it just longer years of being in that, but it’s longer years of being in it and isolated,” Fisher said.
The isolation can lead to behavior being normalized for children, Fisher said, which can delay disclosure by the child. 
Zenita Delva, executive director of District 2 CASA, which covers Clearwater, Latah, Lewis, Idaho and Nez Perce counties, said the number of foster children dropped significantly during the pandemic and hasn’t returned to prior levels. 
Delva said the north central CASA program was serving 54 children in September. It had typically served around 150 to 200 children at a time a few years ago, she said. 
“COVID obviously did a little bit of that, but it should’ve picked up afterwards, but it hasn’t,” she said. “It’s just continually decreased and decreased.” 
Maggie Thompson, director of programs for the Fourth District CASA program in Ada County, said number of foster children in the region are also declining. The program, which also serves Boise, Elmore and Valley counties, was actively serving 288 children in September. Last year, the program served a total of 461, down from 516 the year before and 550 two years before. 
Linville Ludwig, of the North Idaho CASA group, is also seeing cases going down. The program has about 76 active cases, she said, and the group has averaged about 240 cases a year. Prior to the pandemic in 2020, the group used to serve about 450 cases a year, she said. 
 An Idaho court decision may have limited law enforcement’s role in child removals  

In 2017, a Health and Welfare social worker and Ada County Sheriff’s Office detective visited a trailer after an anonymous report from a neighbor regarding loud crashing sounds and a child with an “unexplained black eye.” 
The detective and social worker determined the inside was “filthy,” reporting water puddled on floor, clutter strewn throughout, and feces and urine filled and were crusted onto the toilet, according to court documents. 
The detective told the parents during the visit that she thought the children were in imminent danger and took them into state custody. A judge soon decided to keep the children in foster homes for a few weeks to ensure the trailer remained cleaned. 
The parents challenged the removal in federal court.

In early January 2024, U.S. District Court of Idaho Judge David Nye ruled that the detective violated the parents’ constitutional rights by removing the children without a warrant. In the case, called Ingram v. Mouser, Nye ruled that the dirty house did not indicate the children would have been in imminent danger in the time it would have taken to receive a warrant for their removal. 
After the decision, there was a steep decline in child removals and entry into foster care from law enforcement. 
Fisher, of Health and Welfare, said the courts have tried to create a system to provide warrants over the phone that would help expedite removals if needed, but not every law enforcement office is using this method. 
“We literally have law enforcement agencies across the state that are refusing to do this work now, and they are claiming that it’s about liability, even though the courts have provided the mechanism for this to happen,” Fisher said. “And I feel like they kind of take a hands off approach to this. I do think that we are missing a number of children out there.” 
Only a judge or police officer may decide to remove a child from their parents’ custody. Social workers with the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare may do assessments and make recommendations to prosecutors, but they do not have authority to remove children.

Delva, of the second district CASA, said she’s seen a significant decrease in child removals by law enforcement in Nez Perce County. In a September interview, Delva said the county saw a police officer remove a child recently, but that it was “the first removal in years.” 
“Very seldom does that happen,” she said. 
The Nez Perce County Prosecutor’s Office does not track the number of child removals by law enforcement, a staff member told the Sun. 
“We’re just seeing some really crazy things that are happening, definitely not in children’s best interest,” Delva said. “There’s no way we only have 50 kids that are abused in this district, there just isn’t.” 
 Some advocates concerned prevention-first policies are keeping some kids in situations too long

Not every district saw a decline in foster children, but most CASA leaders said volunteers are seeing a higher severity of the cases that do come in. 
“I’ve been an executive director for 18 years, and I probably in the past two years have seen the worst cases that I’ve ever seen come across, and pretty significant abuse,” said District 5 CASA Executive Director Tahna Barton. 
Her district covers Twin Falls, Blaine, Camas, Cassia, Gooding, Jerome, Lincoln, and Minidoka counties. 
She said many of these children have been experiencing significant abuse or neglect for a long time before being removed and placed in foster care.
“I don’t know why we’re not catching them sooner,” she said, “or if we’re trying to work a prevention plan with them, most of the cases that do come in are prevention plans that have failed.” 
In recent years, state and federal child welfare authorities have shifted toward policies meant to prevent removal of children from their homes by providing families with services to keep the environment safe and healthy for their kids. 
In his first term, President Donald Trump signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which included the Family First Prevention Services Act. The act included federal funding focused on prevention services. 
This year, the Idaho Legislature approved a budget for Health and Welfare that highly emphasized prevention. Former agency director Alex Adams announced a primary focus on improving the state’s foster care system when he took over in June 2024. Adams and his Deputy Director of Child, Youth & Family Services, Monty Prow, have both highlighted shifting to prevention. 
In foster care, Idaho Department Health and Welfare budget proposal focuses on prevention

Prow in a previous interview with the Sun likened the focus to building a fence around a large cliff rather than paying for the ambulance at the bottom. 
“Would you rather invest in fences or ambulances?” Prow said at the time. “It’s very clear. Research is clear that investing in avoiding the fall from the cliff is far better for everybody. Not just the youth, not just the family, but the community.”
The agency’s approved budget this year included 36 new staff positions focused on prevention services, including visiting homes regularly to assess safety and providing or connecting families with services, such as for mental health, anger management, or substance use treatment, the Sun reported. 
In fiscal year 2025, 89.3% of removals from families were primarily due to neglect, according to data provided by Health and Welfare. In fiscal year 2025, neglect accounted for 59.7% of removals. 
Many of the CASA directors told the Sun they aren’t privy to prevention cases, as they only are involved once a child is removed and enters the court system, so they can’t know how many are successful. 
Fisher, of Health and Welfare, said that many of the prevention cases are successful, but she can see why the advocates may get frustrated when they see a case that’s come in after a long time. 
“People then look at it and say, ‘well, you’ve had this case for a whole year, and look at all the problems.’ But it’s not because we haven’t tried to keep this family out,” Fisher said. “We’ve worked with them, we’ve done everything that we can, and now we know that we know they need the services and bring them into the court and that kind of more expansive oversight that we try to avoid if we can.” 
Elisha Horrocks, who oversees the District 3 CASA program in southwest Idaho, said she’s unaware of successful prevention plans in her area, but that “the failed prevention plans we do see are usually the worst abuse.” 
Thompson, whose CASA program in and around the Treasure Valley, said that in some of the severe cases she’s seen, it has been when prevention didn’t work. She doesn’t think the focus is all negative, however. 
She and other CASA directors agreed that prevention cases for families who are in need of services, such as help buying groceries or other basics, are better than removing children from their parents in many situations. 
“There is a very fine line between poverty and neglect,” Thompson said. “And as a private citizen and a human being, I don’t believe that parents should be punished for living in poverty. … It’s so easy to Monday morning quarterback the Department of Health and Welfare because we get to see what happens when reasonable efforts aren’t possible to keep a family together.”
 Idaho Health and Welfare has a plan to keep children safe in prevention or removal cases 

Each person interviewed by the Sun said the increasing severity of abuse may stem from a complicated combination of factors — including some prevention policies, the pandemic, as well as economic hardships and increasingly poor mental health nationwide.
However, when it comes to a factor Health and Welfare can control, Fisher said she wants to focus any prevention effort on the safety of the children. 
She is spearheading a return to use of a tool that she believes will help children in these cases expeditiously get to the best outcome for their situation. 
Earlier this month, she initiated training using what are called “poor prognosis indicators,” which are national standards to determine if a child would be better served by reunification or termination and permanency in the form of adoption by another family. 
“They’re national indicators that would really be able to help our social workers critically think through cases where they, based on what those indicators are, might understand the case a little bit better from an earlier perspective that this case clearly has some reunification efforts that are very strong,” Fisher said.
If the indicators suggest a “poor prognosis” for the child, then case workers would try to move more quickly toward placement in foster care and eventual adoption so children aren’t “languishing in foster care,” Fisher said.
In advance of rolling out this method, the agency analyzed its cases from 2023 and 2024 with the indicators and found they often accurately predicted termination of parental rights. 
“It was astounding how accurate the indicators were,” she said. 
Training began regionally at the beginning of October and is expected to finish by the end of December, she said. 
“If we can reunify children with families, that is a goal, and that’s great, but that’s not our job.” Fisher said. “Our job is the safety of children.” 
Barton, of the District 5 CASA program, noted that prevention-first policies and the Ingram v. Mouser decision occurred around the same time, and said it was “a perfect storm” for child welfare cases that raised alarms for her and other advocates. 
Barton and every leader of Idaho CASA programs who talked to the Sun expressed a strong desire for improved outcomes in foster care, but also a belief that change was possible. 
“It’s been my experience that the system is broke,” Barton said. “But within that system, there are a lot of people that care, and a lot of people that are doing the best they can with what they’ve been given … They’re really passionate and care about our children. And I think that easily gets lost in the finger pointing and the blaming.”

The tiny school at the foot of the Bighorn Mountains posted the highest WY-TOPP scores across science, math and English language arts — for the second year running. How do they do it?
The post Meet the married couple steering Ten Sleep School to top academic marks appeared first on WyoFile .","TEN SLEEP—On a rainy Thursday in September, English teacher Jessica Jackson stood in a second-floor classroom talking with a handful of high school students about gothic literature. The topic was timely, given the season and weather. 
Jackson’s students were writing an original horror story for an ongoing project. The class discussed the nuances between horror and thriller genres, the works of Edgar Allan Poe and elements of gothic fiction like supernatural forces. Conversation ranged from historical context to Hitchcock films to the antiheroes of comic books.
Students were engaged but casual. They did not give the impression of educational automatons being drilled for the sole purpose of scoring high on standardized tests. 
And yet, testing excellence is one thing they do. Ten Sleep K-12 School topped the state in the latest Wyoming Test of Proficiency and Progress scores, earning the highest proficiency in all three content areas tested — for the second year running, and by notable margins. 
Ten Sleep’s proficiency scores of 77% in English language arts, 81% in math and 84% in science were well above statewide averages of 56%, 51% and 51%, respectively.
So, what’s the secret to their success? 
There isn’t one silver bullet, school officials say. But to understand the dynamic factors, head to the administrative offices. Annie Griffin occupies the desk of Washakie County District 2 superintendent, while her husband, Robert Griffin, is the school’s principal.

Having a married couple helm a school’s administration isn’t ideal in every situation, and it could even lead to disaster. But the Griffins share a cohesive vision and decades of experience, from classroom teaching to implementing education policy. 
In Ten Sleep, their goal is to provide truly individualized education — something arguably more achievable in this tiny school, which serves just 108 pupils in kindergarten through 12th grade. A class size of around 10 per grade makes it an environment where staff can assess every kid and tailor to his or her needs, the Griffins say. 
But success also entails reframing the whole idea of teaching, so that it’s less about what the teacher taught and more about what the students learned. Once educators make that fundamental switch, Annie Griffin said, teaching to mastery becomes more attainable. Not that it’s easy. 
The difference is in “not giving up until that student masters it,” she said. 
The Griffins have also worked to nurture Ten Sleep’s long-running academic pride. They want students and staff to embrace and celebrate academic excellence just as much as school communities do when a sports team wins a state championship. 
After all, Robert Griffin said, “this might be the best form of a state championship to win.” 
Data dive
The current picture of academic testing scores in America isn’t exactly bright. 
The latest results of the National Assessment for Educational Progress, known as The Nation’s Report Card, showed discouraging declines in math, reading and science scores and alarming increases in students who lack basic skills. 
Even in Wyoming, where students consistently outperform their peers in other states, scores are still recovering from a pandemic-era slump. Wyoming student performance in the 2024-25 WY-TOPP test areas increased by 1-3% over the previous year. But statewide proficiency remains around 50%-55% — far behind Ten Sleep scores.  
The Griffins came to Ten Sleep in 2022 from Ranchester, where Annie Griffin had been principal of Tongue River Elementary School. Tongue River was named a National Blue Ribbon School in 2021, a designation of excellence.

It was a tricky time to start — plans for a new Ten Sleep school building were at 65% completion, they said, and much of the secondary school staff had recently exited.  
That presented challenges and opportunities. On one hand, it was a bit of a blank canvas, allowing them leeway without the resistance to change that can exist when things have been done a certain way for a long time. 
“We were fortunate enough to walk into kind of a clean slate, and establish our culture from the moment that we got here, both with students and with staff,” Robert Griffin said. 
“It was a lot of listening, to start,” Annie Griffin added. 
Ten Sleep already had a solid foundation of academic success, Robert Griffin said. The district consistently scored high compared to peers, particularly in ACT testing. 
The Griffins didn’t settle for the status quo, however. The first thing Robert Griffin did as principal was dive into numbers. 
“I went into the data for each student,” he said. “So for every single student, I had an understanding where their proficiencies were. So that kind of pinpoints where you need some medicine, if you will, academically.”
That allowed the Griffins to identify areas for instruction improvement — in this case, focusing on reading and writing, particularly in the lower levels. They began working with staff to execute those changes using evidence-based approaches. 
Thirsty to learn 
Teachers’ openness and adaptability were crucial, Robert Griffin said. 
“Their willingness and desire to perform at a higher standard, I would highlight it as the key feature,” he said. “They wanted to be better. That scenario led us to having a tremendous opportunity to grow students academically.”
For teachers, making sure every student has mastery of a concept takes time and patience. It can be slow and tedious. Going back to fill gaps in foundations is hard work. But it makes a world of difference, Annie Griffin said. 
While not all Wyoming districts enjoy the benefits associated with small class sizes, Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder said Washakie County School District 2 illustrates how a commitment to improvement yields results.

“I am proud of their work and hope that other districts will seek to learn more about how they continue to perform at the highest level in the state,” Degenfelder said.
The Griffins lead by example, said the school’s business manager Rachel Casteel. They are approachable, fair, supportive and work to create a positive environment.
“They care about all of the children, and they care about every single one of the employees that they have here,” Casteel said. 
Those attributes trickle down, she said, and contribute to the kind of organizational pride that motivates both teachers and students to do their best.  
Different paths to education
The Griffins are both products of Wyoming schools. They grew up in Glenrock, where they knew one another but were in different grades. They started dating shortly after high school graduation, and got married at the ages of 18 and 19. 
Annie knew her destiny in about third grade. “I knew from the beginning that I was going to be a teacher,” she said. 
Robert, meanwhile, never entertained the idea of teaching. While she went to college to be a teacher, he served in the military and then pursued a career as a physical therapist. Around that time, he started coaching kids’ sports. He loved it. 
“And then that kind of opened my eyes to the possibility of a profession where you have that experience of working with kids and growing kids,” he said.

They were classroom teachers for many years, learning from mentors and experiences. Teaching for more than a decade in Colorado schools with less per-pupil funding, for example, taught them how to stretch resources.
“But we also knew what Wyoming had to offer, and so we brought our children back,” Robert Griffin said. They relocated to Sheridan County School District 1 when their twin daughters were 3 years old. They stayed for 13 years, Robert working as a classroom teacher and Annie as principal. 
When they saw openings for both principal and superintendent in Ten Sleep, they said, it seemed like a good next step. 
Celebrating 
Construction is still ongoing at the school site, but teachers and classes have moved into the new building, which features updated classrooms and a central assembly space. 
Inside the school that rainy September day, kids and teachers donned pajamas as part of homecoming festivities. 
Ten Sleep School is into celebrating, the Griffins said. They celebrate student growth in performance, academic achievement, sports, project-based learning and career and technical programs. They celebrate when teachers make a difference in a kid’s lives. 
Celebrations, Annie Griffin said, allow them to say, “look what you can do when you just do your best, and look what we can do together.”

Wyoming incarcerates children at rates higher than most states in the nation. New lawmakers reject their predecessors’ efforts to understand why.
The post Fear of government overreach again stymies effort to lower Wyoming’s high juvenile incarceration rates appeared first on WyoFile .","For the third time, freshman lawmakers in the Wyoming House on Monday killed a bill that would have helped the state better evaluate child welfare and juvenile justice programs.
The Department of Family Services and longer-serving legislators want the agency to synthesize data from the multiple systems that serve the state’s families and children. Doing so would allow the agency to better support struggling families before they end up requiring court-ordered interventions, department officials say, but it requires a change to confidentiality statutes.
New House members, however, have stopped the measure over concerns about government overreach into people’s privacy.  
The statute change would also let the agency examine how kids move through the criminal justice system — a question today that largely remains a black box for both outside researchers and government officials. 
Wyoming incarcerates children at rates higher than most states in the nation — in 2021, it was the worst state on that metric.
That year, the Legislature’s Joint Judiciary Committee began examining the juvenile justice system, with lawmakers at the time noting it was costing taxpayers a lot of money to confine the state’s youth. That high cost is paired with poor outcomes for children, who, research has found, do not benefit from incarceration.  
But lawmakers seeking to improve the system quickly ran into a wall.
Depending on where in the state they live, juveniles can see their cases adjudicated in circuit, municipal and district courts. Those different tracks, plus privacy statutes for minors, have made it impossible to follow cases and see how often children make it out of the system or end up incarcerated.
“It became very apparent to this committee and to all of us that work in this space that there’s really no way to know or understand how a juvenile progresses or where those opportunities for intervention may be,” DFS Director Korin Schmidt said Monday.
“It’s impossible for us to even talk about the ‘why,’” behind the high youth incarceration rates, Schmidt told lawmakers on the Joint Judiciary Committee, “because of the disconnects between the systems.”
For now, getting to the bottom of that “why?” will likely remain out of reach.

The House side of the committee voted 6-3 not to advance Schmidt’s bill on Monday. Though the four senators present all backed the measure, legislation must receive majority support from both the House and Senate sides of the committee to earn an endorsement ahead of the session.
“It came down in my opinion to a philosophical vote,” Sen. Larry Hicks, a longtime Republican senator from Baggs who votes deeply conservative, told WyoFile on Tuesday. 
“I’ve been on both sides of that issue, so I understand where everybody is coming from,” Hicks said. “Historically, I was on the side that erred much more on people’s right to privacy than on government sharing data.” His stance changed with time spent in the legislature learning the criminal justice system, he said. 
Schmidt was making her case to a new, and very different, judiciary committee than the one that worked on juvenile justice reform over several years. That committee in 2024 gave the department’s data bill its stamp of approval. 
But when the Legislature largely turned over in the 2024 election cycle, the House side of that committee began this year staffed by freshman lawmakers, many of whom align with the conservative Wyoming Freedom Caucus. Those lawmakers rejected the DFS bill twice during the last session. The House Judiciary Committee rejected the measure at the session’s beginning. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Jared Olsen, a Cheyenne Republican, revived the bill and the senate passed it, but then the House Labor, Health and Social Services Committee again voted it down. 
Schmidt and Rep. Lloyd Larsen, a longtime Republican representative from Lander who has advocated for the bill, told WyoFile that after three rejections by House committees, there is little appetite left for another run at it this coming session. 
Instead, Larsen said, the new lawmakers may need to build their own understanding of the state’s juvenile justice systems in order to advance solutions. “For some of these new members this conversation gets stalled out by their lack of historic or institutional knowledge,” he said, “so we have to get back and repeat that work before we can get some of this stuff moved forward.” 
One lawmaker who opposed the bill, Rep. Jayme Lien of Casper, seemed to suggest that repetitive step while explaining to the panel why she would vote against Monday’s bill. 
“My recommendation would be that the Legislature take some time to really put together a good dive into the juvenile justice system and all of its programs together to be able to make one clear, concise bill that fixes a plethora of problems,” she told her colleagues. 
Lien did not respond to a voicemail from WyoFile left Wednesday evening. Two other Republican representatives who voted “no,” Rep. Laurie Bratten of Sheridan and Rep. Joe Webb of Lyman, also did not respond to voicemails from WyoFile seeking comment on their votes. 
“I think there are a lot of things that need to be looked at in this bill to secure data, to secure things that can help our youth and can help families,” Webb said before the vote. “That’s the reason that I will be a no on this is I think we need to look at those things before we impose a bill such as this one.”
Rep. Tom Kelly, also of Sheridan, told WyoFile the bill clashed with his concerns for the privacy of families and minors in the face of possible government intervention. Kelly was endorsed by the Wyoming Freedom Caucus but describes himself as a libertarian-leaning lawmaker. 
“No matter how many times I’ve heard this bill explained,” Kelly said, “all I hear is ‘I’m here from the government and I’m here to help,’ and for someone from my line of thinking, that sends chills up our spines.” 
He did not trust DFS to use the data to evaluate its own programs for effectiveness, he said, or to protect the data and people’s confidentiality from leaks or hacks. 
“As someone who has studied political science for decades,” Kelly said, if DFS were to examine the effectiveness of its intervention, “I can already tell you the report will be ‘we’re doing a great job, we just need more money.’”
It boiled down to a check on power, he said. “She [Schmidt] wants the department to have more power and I don’t,” he said. “I understand she doesn’t want to wield it maliciously, she has good intentions. But my default mode is to not give government more power.”
Schmidt told the committee much of the data in question is on systems maintained by the tech giant Salesforce, which helps provide the latest protective systems. It is also maintained under security standards set by the Wyoming Department of Enterprise Technology Services, the statewide IT agency. 
DFS officials were likely to seek outside help in evaluating data from the juvenile justice system, because it’s largely outside the department’s capabilities, she said in an interview with WyoFile.
And it’s not just the department that wants to analyze what’s working and what’s not for Wyoming youth. Independent academics and journalists who have raised questions about DFS and the state’s handling of juvenile justice also want to see the data restrictions loosened, so there’s more information with which to evaluate and critique the system.
Wyomingites can’t track whether prosecutors and judges in one county are incarcerating kids more than in another, nor determine how that works out for the youth involved. Wyoming law, meanwhile, leaves wide discretion to prosecutors to decide how to charge children accused of crimes in juvenile or adult courts, which can lead to very different outcomes. 
“This is actually for the protection of kids,” Kayla Burd, a professor at the University of Wyoming, told WyoFile in an interview. She’s studied how children in the Wyoming justice system can receive disparate outcomes based on the community they’re in, or based on their race. 
“If we can’t track [youth] outcomes we don’t know what is or what is not working for our communities,” Burd said. “Or maybe we don’t notice patterns of certain [officials] using their discretion in different ways than folks in other counties. I think that is a real problem.” 
Burd later added that state officials focused on the cost of government should want to know if dollars are being spent most effectively. 
“We have high rates of spending on out-of-home placements, and much less funding going towards community-based options, but without better data, we can’t demonstrate how kids are faring, or whether we are devoting dollars to the ‘right’ sources,” she wrote in an email.

As the 2026 election approaches, it's time to start asking hard questions about who embodies our hopes for Wyoming's future, writes Khale Lenhart.
The post Wyoming must elect trustworthy candidates ready to lead appeared first on WyoFile .","Running for office is a big undertaking. Beyond the logistical challenges of running a campaign, it requires candidates to be vulnerable in a way that most of us will never experience. Candidates must be willing to stand before their fellow citizens, express their ideas and values and submit to the decision of their fellow voters. Results are public. There is no hiding when you stand for public office. 

Opinion

This is not a decision that should be taken lightly. It requires an investment of time and effort, and usually a fair bit of money. A serious candidate will often spend years preparing and ensuring that the decision to run is the right one. I have found that the best candidates often enter the race reluctantly. It is exciting to run, but those who know what they are in for often feel their excitement mix with dread for the burden they are taking on. 
For the past several years, I have considered whether running for office would be right for me. I care deeply about Wyoming and her future. I look at our state and see the need for new leaders to step forward. There comes a time when you must answer the call.
When I seriously began thinking about public service, one of the first things I did was take stock of our state’s challenges, my own strengths and interests and where I might be most useful. I spent a good deal of time discussing my ideas with friends, colleagues and those I considered like-minded. A common thread emerged: I should seriously consider running for governor. 
So, I seriously considered it. I spoke with current and former officeholders, political professionals and community leaders. I received far more encouragement and support than I expected, and it soon became clear that this idea was not just a pipe dream. While not a front-runner, I found myself in the position of a dark horse that other potential candidates had to take seriously. One of the most important questions you must ask yourself when making these decisions is whether there is a legitimate path to victory. As I went through this process, I saw a path. It was a narrow path, but a path nonetheless. 
However, just because there is a path does not necessarily mean it is the right one. Beyond just the willingness and the opportunity, there are other important things to consider. Am I willing to take on the responsibility that comes with running this race? Am I willing to subject my family to that experience? If I win, what do I want to accomplish? Am I prepared? Is this the right season of life to try this? These and a million other questions all must be answered.
Ultimately, as I made my decision, two questions rose to the top. First, would I be willing to ask those around me to take up the burden that comes with my running for office and second, would running make it more or less likely that Wyoming would have effective leadership? Based on the answers to these questions, I determined that now was not the time for me to throw my name in the ring. 
But just because I am not running for governor in 2026 does not mean I will not be involved in the process. I have asked the same questions of others considering the race, and because I believe our state’s leadership is important, I will be doing all I can to support the candidate I believe is best equipped to lead our state. I hope others will do the same.  With that said, this column is not where I intend to make my political endorsements. My voice is my own, and other than this note here, I will not be commenting directly on the race in my regular columns. 
All my fellow citizens should participate in this process. We all should be asking the questions I was asking of myself when I considered a run. What do I have to offer? What is my vision for the future? How can I contribute? If we all take these questions seriously, I am confident we will make the right choices. But make no mistake, elections have consequences. The decisions we make about our leaders today will shape our future. The next year will see many conversations about our state’s direction. Let us choose the leaders who deserve our trust.

Solitary confinement, the practice of putting someone in isolation in a small cell, is not a topic you expect to hear discussed at church on Sunday.
But on Oct. 12, at the Madison Christian Community, was a stop of the 18-city, nationwide Journey to Justice Bus Tour, that included two panel discussions focused on the topic, one with four state legislators, including two candidates for governor.
Visiting the Journey to Justice bus, standing in a bathroom-sized solitary jail cell replica and hearing the real-life stories of those who had spent part of their lives confined in such spaces, visitors gained a visceral appreciation of the United Nations declaration that punishing people with more than 15 consecutive days in solitary is a form of  torture.

In the Hollywood presentation, the practice is reserved for hardened criminals, a safeguard against violence that’s necessary to keep good order and discipline.
But the reality is that small procedural violations, medical conditions, mental health crises sometimes even pregnancy are reasons people inside our prisons end up isolated for multiple days at a time.
Those who have experienced solitary confinement, otherwise known as restrictive housing or segregation, say it is traumatizing and even years after they’ve been released from prison, they are still reliving dark memories.
The Solitary and Conditions of Confinement Legislation panel at the church included four Democratic state legislators, including gubernatorial hopefuls  Sen. Kelda Roys and Rep. Francesca Hong, both of Madison. Roys, an attorney, has served on the Judiciary Public Safety Committee and worked on the Innocence Project when she was a law student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Milwaukee area Reps. Darrin Madison and Ryan Clancy also participated. Madison is a former organizer for Youth Justice Milwaukee and a member of the Correction Committee. Clancy sits on the Corrections Committee and has served on the Judiciary and Law Enforcement Committee.

Jen Ann Bauer, who spent five and a half years in prison and is currently serving the remainder of her sentence on community supervision said she was put in solitary confinement at least four times, with the longest lasting 90 days.
“When people hear you’re in solitary confinement, they think discipline, and it is so much more to the detriment of human beings,” she said. “It is isolating. It is defeating. It is control and it is torture. We are often placed in solitary confinement for protection or safety measures, minor and major rule violations, or simply for struggling with trauma and mental health. And let’s be honest, most incarcerated people are already trauma survivors. So I ask, how is isolating a wounded person somehow equal to safety? Solitary doesn’t lock a body in a cell. It locks a person inside their own mind. Time stops and pain does not.”
In solitary, Bauer said, she paced the floor just to remind herself that she still existed.

“Women survive through connection, through relationships, and so when you take away human contact, you take away the very thing that keeps us alive,” she said. “No one is built to handle 23 hours a day in a cell. That’s not discipline, that’s psychological torture.”
She added  that in solitary there is no interaction with outside family members, weakening relationships with children.
Observing  people who spent time in solitary,  she said, she saw that they changed for the worse.
“People with dreams come out of solitary unable to make eye contact, unable to trust and unable to believe in themselves or the world around them,” she said. “Solitary doesn’t confine a body. It suffocates the heart. It doesn’t correct behavior. It destroys identity. Solitary confinement causes psychological and emotional distress, more harm, more trauma. Solitary confinement is not a tool. It is a wound, and it is a wound the system continues to inflict on people and then blame them for bleeding.”

Ventae Parrow agreed with Bauer that solitary confinement  had no redeeming  impact on him in prison other than causing him to reflect on what he wanted for his life. He questioned who had the authority to determine whether one should be in solitary, and noted that many who experienced it came out angrier.
“And now you got angry humans coming out back to the community with the vengeance in their heart and their mind versus rehabilitation,” he said.
Tom Denk, an advocate with several WISDOM affiliates and a member of the Mental Health Action Partnership, moderated the panel. Denk, who had also spent time in solitary confinement, noted there is a high rate of mental illness among incarcerated residents, 45%, and the experience of being isolated exacerbates their conditions.
“The use of solitary confinement or restrictive housing is a correctional practice with significant ethical implications,” said Denk. “Prolonged isolation has been associated with severe psychological distress, including anxiety, depression and increased risk of self-harm. It also worsens existing mental health conditions and contributes to higher rates of recidivism.”
But Denk said solitary is often chosen as a method to address psychosis instead of treatment.
Talib Akbar, vice president of the non-profit advocacy group WISDOM, the organizer of the event, said any rule violation in prison could result in being sent to solitary. He said even being a couple of feet outside a cell door could result in being sent to solitary.

The Wisconsin Examiner recently heard from a former resident of Oshkosh Correctional Institution who said he was put in segregation after calling the nearby fire department to report concerns over the prison’s fire safety protocols. He claims that when the fire department called the prison’s facility manager, the manager became upset that the resident didn’t follow the chain of command, and the resident was placed in segregation.  
The panel also addressed the types of medical treatments residents receive in solitary.
Megan Hoffman Kolb whose father, Dean Hoffmann, died in solitary confinement at Waupun Correctional Institution in 2023,  said her father, who suffered from mental illness for 30 years, didn’t consistently get the right medication for the first 80 days in Waupun and never received a psych intake exam, which he was supposed to have received.
She said when her father recorded a credible threat from his cellmate, the prison’s response was to place him in solitary.

“In solitary, he was locked alone in a concrete cell, 24 hours a day, no books, no paper, no phone calls home, no medication,” she said. “The lights were left on constantly. Silence was deafening, broken only by the sounds of people crying out down the hallway. He told staff he was suicidal, hearing voices and couldn’t sleep. A correctional officer responded, ‘What do you want me to do about it?’”
She added, “Solitary confinement is not just isolation. It’s sensory deprivation. It’s a slow unraveling of a person’s mind in a small space. Days blur together, hope disappears for someone already struggling with mental illness, unbearable, and it’s not just emotional, it’s biological. Prolonged solitary confinement literally changes the brain.”
After nine days in solitary, Kolb said, her father took his own life by hanging himself from the cell door. She had viewed the video of his body being removed.
She said the cost of solitary is the trauma the family has experienced, along with the lawsuits, investigation and broken communities, and at the end of the day, taxpayers are being asked to pay for all of it.
“We are pouring millions into a system that tortures instead of treats,” she said, “and families like mine are left paying the ultimate price.”
Regarding the cost of operating solitary, Akbar noted that prisons have to assign more correctional officers (COs) for supervision there because they are considered more dangerous areas, which also raises the cost.
Rep. Clancy said he is against solitary and the ultimate goal should be to ban it outright, but a more attainable goal is proposed legislation that would restrict solitary to 10 days and require 15 hours a week of programming while in solitary to ensure there are visits by people.

“When you talk to people at the DOC and they say, ‘Well, we looked at your legislation, it is onerous. There’s no way we’re going to be able to do that.’ We’re like,‘Great, then don’t put people in solitary.’”
He added, “Please understand that the goal here is to end solitary, but it’s also to bring to people’s minds the real harm from it.”
Rep. Madison said he grew up with a friend who went to prison and was put in solitary, and when his friend got out he still struggled with isolation. One time, the friend wasn’t able to contact Madison and then attempted suicide but didn’t die.
“I was reminded that it is our correctional system that creates the conditions where folks, even when they are released into the community, feel locked up,” he said.
“We simply incarcerate too many people,” said Roys.  She added the goal should be to ensure public safety, not incarcerate people who don’t pose a threat. 
“If we actually want public safety, then we need to change the way we are thinking about that time when people are incarcerated, and it really should be that time that they are building their skills so that they are going to see that they can thrive, and that is why we need to be fostering relationships,” she said.
She also said there needs to be reform of the Truth-in-Sentencing law that is leading to longer prison stays without parole, resulting in more people in prison, and also reforming community supervision to change  a “gotcha” attitude — finding technical violations of those on extended supervision that would send them back to prison, instead of  focusing on helping people succeed in the community.
“If our parole officers, probation officers (POs) viewed their role as facilitating success, and they judged themselves not by how many people would get reincarcerated, but by how many people succeed and never have to be reincarcerated, that’s transformational, and you don’t necessarily need statutes to do that. You absolutely do need a strong will and strong leadership from the top director who says what we are doing.”
Hong said more could be done through executive orders and the governor’s clemency power to grant pardons. She also said she would like to invest more to hire social and mental health workers.
“The more helpers that we have in an institution, the fewer enforcers we need in that same institution,” Clancy said. 
“We have to stop saying that our jails and prisons are understaffed,” he added. “They are not understaffed. They are overpopulated.”
Clancy also said the DOC should pay mental health staff as much, or more, as it does  guards, to help hire and retain staff.
Women in solitary
During a panel discussion on women in solitary, Julie Bliefnick said that after she was assaulted inside  a prison while eating lunch, she was placed in solitary for six days, and during that time she had her monthly period, but male guards didn’t allow her to shower or have clean clothes. She had a similar experience in a county jail.

“That’s some of the most dehumanizing experiences of my whole life,” she said.
In another jail, Bliefnich witnessed a friend who was eight months pregnant put in a cell and stripped naked to look for drugs as the friend screamed.
“You can even move from that environment for decades, and you can still dream about it,” she said.  “You can still think about it like til this day, like I can hear jingling keys, and I’ll still get like, you know, like a fear of like a guard coming to, you know, harass me about something or another, and it’s a terrifying thing because I’m not there anymore. You know, your brain tricks you into thinking that you are. You carry it with you no matter how long you’ve been removed from it.”
Jessica Jacobs, who has not been incarcerated for eight years, still said she is traumatized by her time in solitary.
“Various times I’ve been incarcerated, being stuck in a room like that kind of did something different to me that maybe other people might not understand,” said Jacobs, “but so I had post traumatic stress disorder already, and then the amount of treatment that I had to suffer and go through while I was incarcerated has made it worse. And so I find myself today, sometimes where I get overwhelmed or stimulated, I know my nervous system is out of whack, where I feel like I have to close myself up into my room, and that’s kind of weird, you know, and I feel like I have to lock myself up, and I just don’t even try to figure out what it is. I know that it’s connected to that.”
Jacobs said she remembers being locked up with a 17-year-old girl who had been sex-trafficked by her father, and the girl was missing her babies and was distraught and wanted mental health services, but Jacobs cautioned against it, knowing that seeking those services often meant being sent to solitary or being restricted to a chair.
“And the next thing I know, they hauled her off and stuffed her in solitary confinement by herself,” said Jacobs. “And then came the big banging and the cries began.”
Yolanda Perkins said her mother was in prison for 17 years and spent time in solitary, and that time changed her mother permanently.
“My mother hasn’t been incarcerated in about 20 years, but she won’t go into a room by herself,” said Perkins, adding, “It affects how she grandparents her grandchildren. It affects her communication with them. It affects her communication with society. And so she still struggles.”
Bliefnick spoke about her work with the Ostara Initiative, working with doulas to end the practice of putting pregnant and postpartum women in solitary for protective custody.
“Punishing women who are in that condition is actually a common practice,” she said, “and I mean, can you think of anything worse than putting a woman who just had a baby and had it ripped away from [her getting] 24 hours in solitary confinement like that? That’s like a horrible practice to begin with. It’s like they treat them like cattle, and then to put them in solitary confinement for their protection is like the cruelest thing that you could possibly imagine.”

Judge Richard L. Young, of Indiana’s Southern District Court, noted that courts can only grant such dismissals when a complaint’s claims aren’t plausible. He found that the lawsuit’s First, Fourteenth and Twenty-Sixth Amendment allegations cleared that bar.
“The court fails to see how — absent any indication of fraud unique to student IDs — general fraud concerns can likewise justify the elimination of a form of photo ID that has been accepted for 20 years and otherwise complies with the voter ID law’s neutral requirements,” the denial reads.
Indiana’s 2005 photo ID law requires that government-issued documents include the prospective voter’s name, photo and a valid expiration date to be considered “proof of identification.”
Public college and university ID cards with those details were valid at the polls — until July 1, when Senate Enrolled Act 10 took effect. The term “proof of identification,” according to the new law, “does not include a document issued by an educational institution.”
Voting rights groups Count Us IN and Women4Change Indiana, along with student Josh Montagne, filed suit in May, about two weeks after the law’s passage. They claim the law imposes an undue burden on Indiana students’ right to vote and discriminates on the basis of age.
Indiana elections chief defends voting ban on ‘unsecured’ student IDs after legal challenge

The state has argued that concerns about voter fraud, as well as the variety of student IDs, justify the ban.
In his denial, Young observed that students may struggle more than others to get an alternate form of ID. They are less likely than other Indiana residents to have a driver’s license, he wrote — or have the time, transportation and documentation needed to get a state ID card.
He described the law as imposing “a somewhat heavier” on students’ and young voters’ right to vote, which “requires stronger scrutiny of the state’s asserted interests.”
The state’s interests — fraud fighting and consistency — were found to be not “particularly strong.”
During the legislative process, officials repeatedly argued that a student ID doesn’t prove someone is an Indiana resident.
But, Young noted, Indiana’s voter ID law was designed to verify that someone at the polls is the person they claim to be, not to check residency. It also allows photo IDs issued by the federal government, which don’t include state residency information.
The state has also argued that the ban solves inconsistencies between student IDs issued by public universities, which are eligible, and private universities, which are ineligible.
Before the ban, any form of ID that met the criteria was allowed, but now, public college or university IDs are “categorically excluded” even if they do meet the requirements. Young added that exceptions for types of ID that don’t meet the criteria — Indiana Code has a lengthy list of federal documents without expiration dates — still qualify for the polls.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Mayor Lee Harris has declared a state of emergency in Shelby County, citing a strain on local resources caused by the surge in federal and state law enforcement deployed to Memphis by Gov. Bill Lee and President Donald Trump. 
The declaration, issued last week and announced publicly Tuesday, cites pressures on the county’s already-overcrowded detention center as a result of an estimated 200% increase in daily arrests made by members of the Memphis Safe Task Force. This state-federal partnership has brought hundreds of outside law enforcement personnel, including the Tennessee National Guard, to the city.
Shelby County includes all of Memphis, as well as a few smaller cities. 
The local state of emergency will continue “until the end of Memphis Safe Task Force operations or until detention facility populations are reduced to capacity level or below,” the declaration read. Lee this week said the operation could “last forever.”
Tennessee governor predicts lengthy Memphis crime fight

The emergency declaration, Harris said this week, frees up spending rules to respond to an increase in arrests, detentions and other costs incurred by law enforcement activity.
County leaders are also contemplating separate legal action to protect residents against “some of the unconstitutional actions we have seen and heard about” during traffic stops and arrests by task force members, including reports of racial profiling, Harris said.
Shelby County is at least the second American county to invoke an emergency declaration in response to Trump’s deployment of law enforcement to blue cities in a stated effort to combat crime and crack down on immigrants without legal status.  The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors earlier this week enacted a state of emergency to aid families impacted by immigration enforcement.
In issuing the emergency declaration, Harris cited state law typically only invoked for severe weather, natural disasters and pandemics to spend money and enter contracts without going through the regular  appropriations process, reassign staff and request state emergency funding.
The emergency order also broadly directs all county departments to “take whatever steps necessary to protect life, property, public infrastructure, and to provide such emergency assistance deemed necessary.”
Memphis task force using TN ‘buffer law,’ preventing up-close recording of police activity

Hundreds of state and federal law enforcement officers – among them officers with the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the FBI and Tennessee Highway Patrol – were dispatched to Memphis in recent weeks after Trump issued a Sept. 15 order establishing the task force to “restore law and order” to one of the nation’s biggest majority Black cities. 
As of Wednesday, the task force had made 917 arrests, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Where all of the arrested individuals are taken remains unclear; 173 were detained on “ICE Administrative warrants” and local attorneys speaking alongside the mayor this week described clients sent to ICE detention facilities out of state. 
But other task force arrestees are being taken to the Shelby County Detention Center, a department official confirmed. 
Shelby County jail officials have long faced criticism for persistent overcrowding and inhumane conditions inside the city’s central detention center, conditions that preceded the recent surge in the task force arrests.
Currently the Shelby County Detention Center holds 2,932 individuals, according to the sheriff’s department spokesperson. The center has a 2800-bed capacity.
Harris contemplates legal action against task force
Shelby County officials are “weighing some sort of legal action in order to put a stop to some of the unconstitutional actions we have seen and heard about,” Harris said, citing anecdotal reports that had come to his office of racial profiling in traffic stops. 
He also aimed sharp criticism at the president and the governor for the actions taking place in Memphis.
“There’s nothing more unconstitutional than the comments made by Donald Trump and others that they’re going to send military forces, the National Guard or whoever else they need to American communities,” Harris said. 
“We have seen our governor be in some of those rooms and instead of rejecting that kind of talk and reminding those in the room that some of their talk imagines actions that are unconstitutional, our governor sat silent and said nothing.”

​​The rate of firearm deaths rose in nearly every category: adult suicide, child suicide and homicides of both adult and child victims. 
The latest numbers put Tennessee seventh in the nation for the rate of gun deaths.
A record number of Tennessee children — 96 — were killed by guns in 2023, the most recent data available shows. In the past ten years, firearm fatalities from all causes increased by 41% in Tennessee.
State Sen. Heidi Campbell, a Nashville Democrat, blamed Republican policy decisions on the rising gun deaths at a news conference held to highlight the gun fatality data.
Report: firearms remain leading cause of child deaths in Tennessee

“There’s no mystery here,” Campbell said. “Republican lawmakers have made it easier for criminals to get guns, and it’s harder for kids to grow up safely. The result is predictable. It’s more shootings. It’s more fatal suicides. And it’s more dead children.”
Republicans rejected Democrats’ efforts to enact red flag laws, strengthen background checks and enact safe gun storage laws, Campbell noted. 
Tennessee Senate Democrats created their own database to track gun deaths in Tennessee following their unsuccessful efforts to enact gun restrictions after the 2023 mass shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville claimed the lives of three children and three adults. 
The database, “Tennessee Under the Gun,” shows that over the past ten years, firearm fatalities involving children increased overall by 128%. Firearm suicides among children rose 115% and firearm homicides for children rose 114%.
Tennessee House Majority Leader William Lamberth, a Portland, Tenn. Republican, blamed “leftist policies that favor criminals” for crime rates in Tennessee.
“Tennessee Republicans have proven that it’s possible to strengthen both freedom and public safety,” Lamberth said.” Unfortunately, in the few urban areas governed by the same Democrats who commissioned this so-called ‘study,’ crime has spiraled out of control due to leftist policies that favor criminals.” 
Lamberth pointed to the arrival of hundreds of federal and state law enforcement in Memphis in recent weeks, including the Tennessee National Guard, as evidence of Republicans’ commitment to combating crime. The Memphis Safe Task Force is a state-federal partnership initiated by President Donald Trump and Gov. Bill Lee. 
“The success of the Memphis Safe Task Force has shown us in just two weeks that it’s not difficult to crack down on crime; you only need leaders willing to do so,” Lamberth said.“Republicans will continue to defend the constitutional freedoms that make our nation strong, and we will use every state and federal resource available to stop the crime wave plaguing our state’s blue cities.”

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)This is one of multiple stories published by NC Newsline around the first anniversary of Hurricane Helene, documenting communities recovering in western North Carolina. Read the previous stories here and here.
SWANNANOA — For two Saturdays a month, residents of Swannanoa have the chance to shop for fresh produce.
The farmer’s market kicked off earlier this year, a new effort from a local nonprofit that cropped up after Hurricane Helene’s floods devastated the community.
Ingles off Highway 70, the town’s only nearby grocery store, is closed indefinitely due to storm damage. For those with cars, the easiest option is a drive up the road to Black Mountain. For those without, it requires a lengthy bus trip.
The bi-monthly market is the latest effort from advocates to fill the gaps, along with Bounty & Soul, a nearby nonprofit long focused on food insecurity. But try as they might, there’s no replicating a full grocery storefront.
“It’s not putting a dent in the system, really,” said Sierra Cranford, the creative director of Swannanoa Resilience Hub and manager of the market. “It’s just what we can do right now.”

The incorporated community, a 15-minute drive east of Asheville, was one of the areas hit hardest by Helene. The Swannanoa River’s surging currents washed away storefronts and homes alike. Debris and damaged homes still dot the riverbank cutting through town.
Lacking access to groceries looms large, particularly for those who live in low-income housing and don’t have cars. But it’s far from the only pressing concern in Swannanoa.
Housing in the community has been upended. Countless affordable homes and rentals were destroyed, and most of the remaining properties are more expensive than residents can afford. And a key FEMA buyout program’s slow rollout has left homeowners impatiently waiting, one year later; the state has more than 300 such applications pending before FEMA.
“We have community members … stuck in a situation where they’re paying a mortgage on a house they can’t live in, and paying rent somewhere to live,” said Tonia Allen, executive director for the Swannanoa Resilience Hub. “That’s untenable. These folks are having to access financial assistance repeatedly, because they can’t cover both.”

Swannanoa lacks “large tracts of buildable land,” Allen said, and the priority remains rebuilding owned homes. But rentals are key, she said, in a town that serves in part as “workforce housing for Asheville.” Tenants, displaced into higher-cost apartments, are forced to find aid to pay for them. And some landlords who owned affordable properties locally don’t have the capital to rebuild themselves, she said.
“A lot of people, maybe they inherited this rental,” Allen said. “And they’re living pretty close to the edge.”
Rebuilding downtown Swannanoa: Blunt Pretzels’ efforts to feed locals & a new grocery store
One storefront in Swannanoa’s Beacon Village has become a refuge for the hungry — Blunt Pretzels.
The German soft pretzel spot began handing out free meals after the storm, in tandem with World Central Kitchen. At its peak last October, they were feeding about 2,000 a day. The store established its own nonprofit, Blunt Kitchen.

Over the months, as more locals regained power, water and work, the rush at mealtimes slowed down. Now, in the coming weeks, Blunt Kitchen will instead start creating pre-made meals — ”high-end TV dinners,” volunteer chef Christopher Smith calls them — with the intent to keep feeding those in need without such a logistical burden.
Smith has high hopes for the future, too. He wants the community to know Blunt as the go-to spot in times of need and disaster. They’re setting up a high-powered food truck that’s “ready to feed people on no notice” — equipped with an independent water source and its own power source.
“Next time the s— hits the fan, people will know, okay, Blunt Kitchen,” Smith said. “They’ve got water, they’ve got food. I can connect with my people.”
And Smith wants to teach people how to better ride out the next storm: how to cook with alternative food sources, how to keep things sanitary when water’s not available.
“Do little clinics to set people up for next time,” he said.
Soon, there will be another spot in Beacon Village for produce and food. Two doors down from Blunt Pretzels, an empty storefront is undergoing total renovation. When it’s complete, it’ll be a small grocery store: Rite Buy Grocery, owned by local couple Diana & Justin Rhodes.

“With our major grocery chain closed, it just became really obvious to me that we need more options in the Valley,” Diana Rhodes told Black Mountain News in August.
The store is planning a soft open by the end of the year.

(Photo: John Partipilo)Lake County is among 34 communities in Tennessee selected to receive state funding from the latest $9.6 million round of ThreeStar grants released this month, according to the state’s Department of Economic and Community Development.
For Lake County residents, that means a $750,000 infusion into repairs and renovations for the county’s two community centers in Ridgely and Tiptonville, Lake County Mayor Danny Cook told Tennessee Lookout. The Tiptonville Farmer’s Market will also receive some investment.
The newly revamped ThreeStar program supports local workforce training, health and economic development initiatives, according to the department.
Once counties have been ThreeStar certified (94 of the state’s counties have certification), they are eligible for state programs and grant funding toward their community goals. Distressed counties are eligible for up to $1 million in grant funding, and other communities can apply for up to $250,000.
West Tennessee counties received roughly a third of the award money from this round of ThreeStar grants.
Lake County is among Tennessee’s “distressed” counties —  a designation signifying that a combination of the county’s unemployment rate, poverty rate and per capita market income ranks among the worst 10% in the United States. In the 2026 fiscal year, Lake County had the highest poverty in the state at 32.3%, according to state metrics.
The roughly 166-square-mile county sits at Tennessee’s northwest corner, separated from Missouri by the Mississippi River with Kentucky to its north. The county’s population stood at just under 7,000 people, according to estimates from the U.S. Census 2023 American Community Survey. 
Agriculture is a mainstay of the Lake County economy, as is tourism. The county welcomes more than 600,000 visitors each year to visit natural sites, including Reelfoot Lake State Park and Lake Isom National Wildlife Refuge, according to the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development. 
Cook describes the community centers as true “civic areas,” open to community members to rent for things like birthday parties, family get-togethers and other gatherings. The Tiptonville Farmer’s Market is based in an old converted building and hosts well-attended markets every other week, Cook said. 
The funding for repairs and renovation will “make our towns look a little bit better for people coming in, as well,” Cook said. “We want to have attractive and comfortable surroundings for them.”
The roughly $3 million going to projects in West Tennessee counties focuses on bolstering development in community, infrastructure, broadband, industry, tourism and recreation.
Three projects received the highest award amount, $1 million:

Grundy County, for education and workforce development
Hancock County, for downtown development
Tennessee College of Applied Technology (TCAT) Oneida, for education and workforce development.

 Applications for the next round will be accepted through December 30.

June 20, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Department of Education is honoring seven “Blue Ribbon Schools” in 2025 after federal education officials ended the national honor roll for high-performing schools.
The U.S. Department of Education had historically honored some of the nation’s schools that performed well on state assessments or nationally normed tests through the National Blue Ribbon Schools program. Terrell H. Bell, President Ronald Reagan’s first education secretary, created the program in 1982.
State officials said the seven Nebraska honorees had already applied and would have met Blue Ribbon standards based on last year’s benchmarks. Four Nebraska schools earned the praise in 2024, and four more earned the title in 2023. About 350 schools were nationally recognized each of those years.
The 2025 Nebraska honorees are:

McDonald Elementary School in North Platte Public Schools (North Platte).
Hillrise Elementary School in Elkhorn Public Schools (Elkhorn).
Ezra Millard Elementary School in Millard Public Schools (Omaha).
Park Elementary School in Kearney Public Schools (Kearney).
St. Isidore Elementary School in the Omaha Archdiocese (Omaha).
Mount Michael Benedictine School in the Omaha Archdiocese (Omaha).
Mary Our Queen Catholic School in the Omaha Archdiocese (Omaha).

“These schools are amazing examples of hard work, focus and the desire for excellence,” Nebraska Education Commissioner Brian Maher said in a statement. “They represent communities from across our state and provide a powerful model for effective and innovative practices for educators throughout Nebraska.”

Federal officials told state education leaders in August that the decision to end the program came in the “spirit of returning education to the states.”
“Awards conceived by those closest to the communities and families served by local schools will do more to encourage meaningful reforms than a one-size-fits-all standard established by a distant bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.,” a federal spokesperson said in August.
The National Blue Ribbon Schools Program honored public and nonpublic schools for exemplary high learning standards or for strides in closing achievement gaps among student subgroups.
Up to 420 schools could be nominated each year under the former national program by top education officials in all states, D.C., Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, U.S. Department of Defense Education Activity and the Bureau of Indian Education. Private schools are nominated by the Council for American Private Education.
Nominated schools submitted a comprehensive application detailing school culture, programs, assessments, instructional practices, professional development, leadership, family and community involvement, according to the Education Department.

Four of seven seats on the board governing Colorado’s largest school district are up for election in 2025: seats representing District 2, District 3 and District 4, and one at-large seat representing the entire city.
As it did two years ago, the DPS race is drawing big spending from Better Leaders, Stronger Schools, an independent expenditure committee, or super PAC, which can spend unlimited sums of money to influence elections but is barred from coordinating directly with candidates. The group’s top donor, Denver Families Action, was founded in 2020 and has roots in the pro-charter “school reform” movement, though its leaders say they have broadened their focus to issues of declining enrollment and school safety, while pivoting away from past reform priorities like standardized testing.
All three DPS board candidates endorsed by the group in 2023 won their elections, and it has reported spending over $560,000 on campaign advertising in 2025 as it looks for a repeat victory. Last month, Better Leaders, Stronger Schools also received a $40,000 contribution from billionaire Republican megadonor Phil Anschutz, according to campaign finance disclosures.
The group has endorsed a slate of candidates consisting of Alex Magaña for the at-large seat, Mariana del Hierro for District 2, Caron Blanke for District 3 and Timiya Jackson for District 4.
Meanwhile, the union representing DPS teachers, the Denver Classroom Teachers Association, has contributed a total of at least $34,188 to the campaigns of four union-endorsed candidates. The group slams its deep-pocketed opponents for “trying to buy influence in our local school board elections.”
The DCTA-endorsed slate consists of Amy Klein Molk for the at-large seat, Xóchitl “Sochi” Gaytán for District 2, DJ Torres for District 3 and Monica Hunter for District 4.
Three other candidates seeking a DPS board seat are not endorsed by either group: incumbent Scott Esserman, who was elected to an at-large seat in 2021, is running to represent District 3; incumbent Michelle Quattlebaum is running for reelection in District 4; and Jeremy Harris is running in District 4.
 Jefferson County
Three of five seats on the Jeffco Public Schools Board of Education — representing District 1, District 2 and District 5 — are up for election in 2025.
Jeffco Public Schools, the state’s second-largest district at over 75,000 enrolled students, includes Evergreen High School, the site of a school shooting last month that left the 16-year-old gunman dead and two other students seriously injured.
Educator Denine Echevarria and IT professional Michael Yocum are running to represent District 1, while attorney Peter Gibbins faces Samuel Myrant in the race for District 2. Both seats are being vacated by current board members. In District 5, incumbent board president Mary Parker is running for reelection against two challengers, mediator Tina Moeinian and Army veteran Gloria Teresa Rascon.
Candidates backed by teachers unions have consistently held a majority on the Jeffco school board since a high-profile recall election that ousted three conservative board members in 2015. The Jefferson County Education Association has endorsed Gibbins and Moeinian in this year’s election.
On Oct. 13, the union rescinded its prior endorsement of Yocum, citing the revelation of a sealed court record that it said was not “disclosed to JCEA during the recommendation process.” The announcement followed a report by the Rocky Mountain Voice, a conservative website owned by former GOP governor candidate Heidi Ganahl, that Yocum in a recording had “acknowledged a deferred adjudication involving a sealed juvenile sexual offense.”
“This does not downplay the actions of political extremists, who are trying to use a complicated and traumatic event from over a decade ago to achieve their own political outcomes,” the JCEA said in a statement. “These harmful political tactics do nothing to support our students, teachers, or public schools.”
 Douglas County
Four of the seven seats on the Douglas County School District board are up for election in 2025: District B, District D, District E and District G.
School board politics in the suburban battleground county south of Denver have been fractious in recent years. After capturing a narrow 4-3 board majority in 2021, conservatives undertook a series of controversial moves, including the ousting of longtime superintendent Corey Wise and revisions to its equity policy, prompting protests from teachers and students. Wise ultimately received an $832,000 settlement from the district, and the district separately paid a $103,000 settlement for violating open meetings laws.
In 2023, three candidates endorsed by the Douglas County Democratic Party swept the school board races. Then-chair Mike Peterson, head of the board’s conservative majority, resigned from his seat the same month.
None of the three remaining conservatives elected four years ago are seeking reelection to their seats in 2025. Like all school board elections, the Douglas County races are officially nonpartisan — but once again, two slates of ideologically aligned candidates are competing in head-to-head contests for each of the board’s four open seats.
The Common Sense DCSD committee aims to preserve the board’s conservative majority, and among the top issues listed on its website is a promise to “fight to preserve girls-only teams, restrooms, and locker rooms,” along with commitments to “parental rights” and “curriculum transparency.” The Douglas County GOP has endorsed the slate. Its candidates are Matt Smith in District B, Keaton Gambill in District D, Dede Kramer in District E and Steve Vail in District G.
The Community’s Voice, Community’s Choice slate, endorsed by county Democrats, emphasizes its candidates’ education experience and promises to make the district “accountable to the people, not politics.” Its candidates are Kyrzia Parker in District B, Tony Ryan in District D, Deborah Kramer in District E and Kelly Densler in District G.
 Cherry Creek School District
Seats representing District D and District E are up for election in the Cherry Creek School District, which serves more than 53,000 students spread across the southeast Denver metro area.
Terry Bates, a financial executive, faces Amanda Thayer, a district volunteer and member of its accountability committee, in the District D race. Bates is running to replace his wife, Kelly Bates, who is term-limited after representing District D for the past eight years.
In District E, Mike Hamrick, an Air Force veteran and retired sales representative, faces Tatyana Sturm, a realtor.
Bates and Hamrick are endorsed by the Cherry Creek Education Association, a teachers union. A newly formed super PAC, Common Sense Excellence, has reported spending $107,000 to oppose the candidacies of Thayer and Sturm. The group received funding from Parents and Teachers United and the Colorado Fund for Children and Public Education, a nonprofit that shares an address with the Colorado Education Association.
 Aurora Public Schools
In the Aurora Public Schools district, which serves over 38,000 students in Adams and Arapahoe counties, all board members are elected at large. Four of the board’s seven seats are up for election in 2025. Voters in the district will cast up to four votes in the field of seven at-large candidates, and the top four vote-getters will be elected.
Two incumbent APS board members, Tramaine Duncan and current board president Anne Keke, are running for reelection. The other candidates are Tapsuru “Ousman” Ba, a nonprofit program coordinator; Gayla Charrier, a small business owner; Hendrix Percival Lewis, a software engineer; Kristin Mallory, a federal contracting officer; and Nino Pepper, a realtor.
The super PAC Students Deserve Better, which received funding from the Colorado Education Association, has reported spending $13,980 on behalf of a slate that includes Charrier, Duncan, Keke and Mallory. Ba has benefited from $16,426 in independent expenditures from a PAC funded by the Colorado League of Charter Schools.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)If you have a mortgage or drive a car, then you are required to purchase insurance. Insurance is a mandated product everyone is familiar with, and we all understand how it works – or so we think.
Insurers write policies that cover our assets and liabilities, and policyholders pay regular premiums for that coverage. The policyholder hopes to avoid the calamity that accompanies accidents and storms but rests easy knowing the insurer will cover their losses if disaster strikes. This is the basic promise of insurance.
The collapse of this core promise is at the heart of Louisiana’s insurance crisis. Insurers are denying nearly half of all claims in Louisiana, according to company data Weiss Ratings analyzed from 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, premium rates continue to soar, which threatens the purpose of insurance itself: protecting policyholders.
People think insurance companies make most of their money by writing policies, but that’s not the case. They generate most of their profits through investments. You pay regular premiums, and insurers hold those premiums until you file a claim, giving them access to large sums of cash – called the float – that they can invest.
Warren Buffett owns and operates several insurance companies under the Berkshire Hathaway umbrella, including GEICO. According to Buffett, insurers “invest this float for their own benefit.” And the benefit is great. 
According to AM Best, property and casualty insurers turned a record $89 billion in investment profits in 2024. For comparison, 2024 was the best underwriting year since 2006 for property and casualty insurers. They posted a $25.4 billion underwriting profit, still a fraction of the profit generated through investments. In Louisiana, Weiss Ratings reports that insurers have made $55 in investment profits for every dollar they have lost since 2004, which includes hurricanes Katrina, Laura and Ida. 
Investments can be so lucrative for insurers that they aggressively seek opportunities to increase their float. They do this in two ways. Higher rates mean more revenue, and paying out less in claims helps insurers retain that revenue.
Insurers often use natural disasters to justify raising rates, as Louisiana residents can attest. In 1992, Allstate commissioned the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. to rework its claims handling process. It proposed paying out less in claims by denying, delaying and lowballing policyholders to boost profits, a strategy insurers have religiously implemented ever since. 
In fact, the insurance industry has lobbied state legislatures to pass “tort reforms” that effectively write McKinsey’s strategy of minimizing claims into law.
In Louisiana, insurers closed 44.6% of claims without payment in 2024, up from 26% in 2004, according to Weiss Ratings research. Seven insurers operating in Louisiana closed more than 50% of their claims without payment, including Allstate. This closely follows the national trend where insurers closed 41% of claims without payment in 2024, a 16% increase since 2004.
Louisiana’s insurance crisis demands accountability from insurers. They’re paying out a shrinking share of claims while raking in record profits from sky-high premiums and massive investment returns. It’s time for real reform that puts policyholders first, guaranteeing fair rates, transparency and robust protections for the people, not just company profits.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Baton-Rouge-flood-2016-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-16 06:56:32.274479

The two grants are part of $15 million that the North Dakota Department of Commerce is awarding to 23 tourism projects across the state. The department announced the Destination Development Grants on Wednesday. 
The largest grant was awarded to North Dakota Country Fest to improve accommodations, including permanent cabins, and build a permanent stage for the music festival near New Salem. The 2026 event is planned for July 8-11. 
North Dakota spends $100K for Tigirlily Gold tourism promotion

Commerce awarded $3 million to restore the historic Urbain Cote Round Barn near Dunseith and use the surrounding farmstead to create a dairy museum. The agritourism site will include dairy demonstrations, a petting zoo, culinary experiences and sales of fresh dairy and other products. 
The project also includes a 40-unit RV park, birding platforms and farm-themed play areas.
Other grants included $1.2 million for Jurassic Junction near Hettinger to turn a bowling alley into a dinosaur-themed destination and $1 million for the Bear Creek Events and Cultural Center near Fargo area that will expand a winery into a year-round venue. The winery will add lodging, an outdoor stage, pickleball courts, trails, a greenhouse, a wood-fired pizza oven, a marketplace, and a seasonal cider and beer garden.
The department said it received 106 grant applications from 45 communities.

(Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Insurance Commissioner Jon Godfread is sounding the alarm on the significant increase to health insurance facing tens of thousands of North Dakotans if the federal government doesn’t renew tax credits by the end of the year. 
Unless the federal government takes action, premiums may rise between $378 and $3,735 in 2026, depending on a person’s income level, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data cited by the Insurance and Securities Department. 
“In some cases it could be double, triple or even quadruple what you paid last year,” said Godfread, a Republican. 
He expects the sharply increasing premiums to affect approximately 30,000 North Dakotans. As many as 10,000 may choose to go uninsured instead, based on third-party analyses Godfread has reviewed. 
Godfread isn’t the only one concerned about the looming tax credit expiration. The prospect of more people becoming uninsured in a few months has the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network among those calling for immediate action. 
“These tax credits are incredibly important for individuals that are undergoing cancer treatments or are in need of basic health care, health insurance coverage,” said David Benson, senior campaigns manager for the organization. 
A closer look at what’s driving the rising rate of uninsured children

Losing affordable health insurance also affects those who are seeking preventive screenings to detect cancer earlier, Benson said. 
The state government can’t do much to help. The enhanced tax credits are a federal program. Godfread said eligibility for the credits was expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic and made it possible for a lot of people to gain access to health insurance. 
“During that expansion we saw a number of farmers, ranchers, small business owners be able to qualify for a subsidy and then also able to access health insurance, which we think is a very good thing,” Godfread said. 
Part of the problem is timing. The enhanced tax credits expire at the end of the year. But open enrollment, the two-month period where people have the opportunity to purchase a health insurance plan, begins in two weeks on Nov. 1. 
Godfread worries the higher cost of insurance plans may drive consumers away from the marketplace even if the subsidy is later renewed by Congress before the end of the year. 
“I’ll take any extension at any time over no extension,” Godfread said. “But I think what it could do is cause some confusion. If individuals go in and shop and they see this large increase, they may not come back and shop again if Congress acts and extends these subsidies.”
He’s no longer optimistic Congress will take action before Nov. 1, though Godfread is holding out hope the tax credits will be renewed before they expire on Dec. 31. 
If policy makers want to end the tax credits, which he said were meant to be temporary during the pandemic, they have to create a “glide path” to minimize the impact on consumers and then have a real discussion about how to make health care more affordable, the insurance commissioner said. 
“Insurance is merely an indicator of what services that you’re covering,” Godfread said. “So you can’t really have a meaningful discussion on ‘how do we bring down the cost of health insurance?’ without having a meaningful discussion on ‘how do you bring down the cost of health care services?’ So that would be an absolutely critical component.”
But the first step in Godfread’s mind is renewing the enhanced tax credits so consumers don’t face significantly higher costs and potentially have to go uninsured in 2026. Then Congress can begin looking for a long-term solution. 
“The challenge is the system is what it is right now and there’s incentive to maintain the status quo and it’s the consumer who is being left out in the cold,” Godfread said. “I’m hopeful that this will spur that conversation.”
The federal government is in the midst of an ongoing shutdown in part because Senate Democrats have thus far refused to vote for a stopgap spending bill to fund the government without renewing the enhanced tax credits for health insurance plans at the same time. 
Rep. Fedorchak says Democrats to blame for potential shutdown, addresses ag issues in virtual forum

Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., has said the two issues are unconnected and should be discussed separately. 
“This issue does need to be addressed, and it will be addressed,” Fedorchak said in an interview Wednesday with NewsNation. “But I think it’s also very important to recognize that premiums have been skyrocketing, even with these premium tax credits and the enhanced premium tax credits.”
Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., has said Democrats’ stand has shut down the federal government in order to “score political points.”
“These major health care policy changes Senate Democrats are demanding should be negotiated through the legislative process, not a short-term continuing resolution,” Cramer said in a statement on Sept. 30, the last day the government was open. “Their wish list of demands is not serious and is an act of extortion.”
Benson said these tax credits have led to record enrollments in marketplace insurance plans and have been instrumental in helping thousands of North Dakotans obtain “affordable, comprehensive coverage to be able to prevent, detect and treat cancer.”
“We are urging Congress to act quickly in finding a solution to extend these tax credits,” Benson said. 
Health care costs in North Dakota, already among the highest in the nation, continue to rise. That’s a big reason why the “base rate” of insurance plans in the state is going up next year, with or without federal action. 
The cost of individual health plans will increase by an average of 23.09% for Medica Health Plan, 8.3% for Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota and 5.12% for Sanford Health Plan as a result of recent base rate increases Godfread’s office has approved for 2026. Small group market health plans will also rise by an average of 8.29% for UnitedHealthcare Insurance Co., 6.3% for Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota, 3.91% for Sanford Health Plan and 7.89% for Medica Insurance Company.
“The cost of receiving health care in the state is continuing to rise,” Godfread said. “We have to do something to get our health care costs under control. North Dakota is a very high cost state to receive health care.”

,California,2025-10-16 10:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom unveils $11 state insulin for Californians: ‘We took matters into our own hands’,Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/10/insulin-california-announcement/,Lawmakers have focused on the high cost of diabetes drugs. The announcement will make state-branded insulin available two years later than the governor originally promised.,"In summary
Lawmakers have focused on the high cost of diabetes drugs. The announcement will make state-branded insulin available two years later than the governor originally promised. 


Starting next year, Californians with diabetes will be able to purchase state-branded insulin at steeply reduced prices, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced today. 
Long-acting insulin pens will be available at pharmacies for $11 per pen — or $55 for a five-pack — beginning Jan. 1. The pens are interchangeable with glargine, the generic alternative for Lantus, a once-a-day injection that regulates blood sugar. An equivalent amount of Lantus sells to pharmacies for more than $92, according to data compiled by the governor’s office, but consumers may pay a different price based on their insurance. 
“California didn’t wait for the pharmaceutical industry to do the right thing — we took matters into our own hands,” Newsom said in a statement released at 3 a.m. Pacific time. “No Californian should ever have to ration insulin or go into debt to stay alive.”
Roughly 3.5 million Californians have diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association.
Lawmakers at the state and federal level have focused in recent years on the high cost of insulin, a life-saving drug used by diabetics. Price caps set by the Biden administration in 2023 as well as public pressure have driven down the cost nationally, according to health economists. 
The sale of insulin is part of the state’s CalRx initiative aimed at lowering prescription drug prices for Californians. Today’s announcement comes three years after Newsom announced the state would tackle the cost of insulin.  The first vials of insulin will be for sale two years after the governor’s promised delivery date of 2024.
Newsom originally pledged that the state would spend $50 million to contract with Civica Rx, a nonprofit drug manufacturer headquartered in Utah. The state earmarked another $50 million to build a manufacturing plant in California, but has given no updates on that project.
In a statement, Elizabeth Landsberg, director of the state health care access department that oversees CalRx, said the program was “committed to transparent pricing, eliminating hidden costs, and ensuring equitable medication access for uninsured, underinsured, and vulnerable residents.”
Less than a week ago, Newsom signed legislation capping out-of-pocket insurance costs for insulin at $35. 
This is a breaking story and will be updated.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-16 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"State changes course, gives wood pellet maker Drax a permit to increase emissions",Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/16/state-changes-course-gives-wood-pellet-maker-drax-a-permit-to-increase-emissions/,A Mississippi board's decision means wood pellet manufacturer Drax no longer has a limit on how many tons of hazardous air pollutants it can release but must follow stricter limits over the rate at which it can release the pollutants.,"The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality permit board on Wednesday reversed a decision from earlier this year and granted wood pellet manufacturer Drax a permit that allows it to release more emissions from a facility in Gloster, in the rural southwestern corner of the state.
The board held a two-day evidentiary hearing after denying the company the permit in April. The permit falls under Title V of the Clean Air Act and allows Drax’s facility Amite BioEnergy, to become a “major source” of Hazardous Air Pollutants, or HAPs.
The board voted unanimously in favor of granting the permit said Kim Turner, a state assistant attorney general who served as hearing officer. Evidence from the hearing “sufficiently addressed” concerns the board previously had over Drax’s compliance history, Turner said.
MDEQ has found the facility in violation multiple times since Drax opened the Amite County plant in 2016. Last year, the agency fined Drax $250,000 for releasing over 50% more than its permitted limit of HAPs while it was a “minor source.” In 2020, MDEQ fined Drax $2.5 million for underestimating its release of Volatile Organic Compounds since 2016.
For years since learning that the company had underestimated its emissions, nearby Gloster residents alleged that air pollutants, dust and noise from the facility were causing an array of health issues. Several who testified to MDEQ and people who spoke to Mississippi Today reported issues such as headaches, dizziness, nausea and difficulty breathing. Nonprofit Greater Greener Gloster represented those residents as an intervenor in the hearing and asked the permit board to affirm its April decision.

Drax applied for the permit in order to better reflect its production capacity. Since violating the current permit, Amite BioEnergy has had to decrease its pellet output. The company maintained a commitment to staying in compliance going forward, advertising the facility’s ability to automatically shut off when emissions exceeded legal limits.
It argued that the new regulation would be more stringent than any other the company has at its 17 locations in North America.
“ What we’re asking you to do is confirm that if a company works with MDEQ to develop a technically sound, environmentally protective permit  which is feasible and enforceable, then that company can do business in Mississippi,” said Abram Orlansky, an attorney for Drax. 
The United Kingdom-based company turns locally sourced wood into pellets that it then ships to other countries for their clean energy goals, although many scientists believe the practice is actually more harmful than other energy sources in terms of net carbon emissions. Drax and other wood pellet companies have faced a wave of both local and international scrutiny for repeated air emissions violations across multiple Southern states.
The distinction of a major source means that the wood pellet facility no longer has a limit on how many tons of HAPs it can release into the air, but it also means the facility has to follow stricter limits over the rate at which it can release the pollutants.

Extended exposure of large amounts of HAPs can increase the chances of health effects such as cancer, damage to the immune system, neurological, reproductive, developmental and respiratory issues among other symptoms, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Much of the hearing’s debate centered on the facility’s “control efficiency,” or how much of its HAPs it could destroy before releasing. While the permit MDEQ presented outlined a 96% destruction rate, witness testimony argued the facility could achieve a 99% rate, which would yield a quarter of the potentially harmful emissions.
“These devices, as installed, could be operated a lot better,” said Ranajit Sahu, an engineering consultant. 
Yet, MDEQ Air Division Chief Jaricus Whitlock said no place he has seen requires such a high rate.
In contrast with April’s hearing, attendees on Tuesday and Wednesday included a dozen or so people with blue “Drax” stickers supporting the company’s permit application. Matt White, the company’s executive vice president, said the local community supported Drax because of its job creation and tax contributions. While Drax staff testified that most of the facility’s employees live within an 11-mile radius of the plant, they could not say how many live in Gloster.

They also call the claims absurd and untrue.
“I think Mike Johnson and others are using fear to try to divide people who have common interests. And they have no respect for facts,” said Dr. Nancy Henly, a pediatrician and protest organizer in Morehead.
In Northern Kentucky, organizer Ann Dickerson said Trump allies are “threatened by more and more pushback from the general population. And the more people we get out to these events, it can’t just be —  and they know this —  it can’t just be all radical, left-wing, blah, blah, blah. Everyday people, former Trump supporters, are coming out and joining us because they’re starting to feel the pain of what’s been happening. And they’re starting to see the injustice.”

U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson last week dubbed a “No Kings” event set for Washington, D.C., a “hate America rally” and claimed Democrats in Congress don’t want to end the government shutdown until after the protest because “they can’t face their rabid base.” Johnson also said the protesters support Hamas.
One of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet members, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Fox that participants across the country are “part of antifa, paid protesters. It begs the question (of) who’s funding it.”
The Lantern interviewed organizers in five Kentucky towns, all of whom said they are unpaid volunteers; several laughed at the idea of being paid.
In Boyle County, Indivisible Danville has no bank account and no designated leader, said Kevin Maples, a spokesperson for the group, which has been holding regular protests, including at the offices of Republicans U.S. Rep. James Comer and Sen. Mitch McConnell.
“If funds are needed we get out our wallets and purses and throw cash in.” Maples said local Indivisible chapters are independent and can apply to the national organization for grants. “We have not done that. We’re not raising money. We’re not asking for money. When money is needed it’s literally mamaws opening up their purses and getting out cash.”
Dozens of groups are partnering with protest organizers nationwide. A Wednesday release from nokings.org says 2,500 protests are planned across the country. Almost 30 are scheduled in Kentucky, a Republican stronghold that President Donald Trump always has carried overwhelmingly.
Organizers acknowledged that inflamed rhetoric aimed at the protesters increases concerns about safety. Some said they’re taking steps in response, including posting more safety marshals, while also discounting the risks in their own towns.
“We’re not afraid because we know our neighbors,” said Maples. “There’s no reason to believe this will be anything other than a peaceful protest. Nonviolence is what Indivisible is about. … We will be joyfully and loudly inviting our neighbors to join us.”
Here are what some Kentucky organizers say about who they are, why they are publicly opposing the Trump administration and the claims by Trump allies that they are anti-American and friendly to terrorists.
Morehead: ‘Don’t give up your rights because you’re afraid’
Dr. Nancy Henly is a pediatrician in Morehead.
“It’s important to me that this be a world that’s good for children. I’m also a grandmother. It’s important to do what I can to keep the world a safe and healthy place,” says Dr. Nancy Henly, a pediatrician who has lived and practiced in Morehead for 40 years.
She grew up and went to medical school in Minnesota where her parents were activists; her father, wounded on Okinawa in World War II, protested the Vietnam War.
They taught her that “sometimes you have to stand up in the street and say that what’s going on is wrong.”
“We’re Americans who want to protect our country from authoritarianism. We want to return to democracy. We’re the real patriots. We’re not scary people.”
Saturday’s protest will be the sixth since April by Morehead’s Indivisible chapter. “We’re not real organized,” Henley says.
“We’re trying to educate people about what’s  happening. Because it’s happening to us. We are all affected by cuts in health care, threats to free speech, due process.”
About 75% of her pediatric practice is covered by Medicaid, which President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act will cut. Medicaid dollars also are critical to the hospital in Morehead, she said.
She labeled as a “complete fallacy” Republican Rep. Hal Rogers’ claim that Democrats shut down the government to provide free health care to what he called “illegal aliens.”
Henly said the inflamed Republican rhetoric is “a little bit scary. I feel like I’m very safe here.”
At an earlier rally she said a man stood at the opposite end of the park with a sign and “some kind of automatic weapon strapped across his chest.”
In an admittedly intimidating atmosphere, she’s been relying on Timothy Snyder’s book “On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons for the Twentieth Century.”
“One of the lessons: Don’t obey in advance. Don’t give up your rights because you’re afraid. I try to keep that in mind.”
Madisonville: Longtime Republican ‘took an oath to support and defend the Constitution’
Hopkins County native Michael Howard’s history as a registered Republican stretches back decades. As a teenager he thought Democratic President Jimmy Carter mishandled the Iran hostage crisis. He enlisted in the Army at 17 and supported the robust national defense espoused by Republican President Ronald Reagan.

After being a Republican election observer in St. Louis, he was asked to be, and ultimately served, as a delegate to the Missouri Republican State Convention in 2008. 
But he told the Lantern that he doesn’t have much in common with his party anymore. 
 “I’ve never been a party voter. I vote for people, and I try to vote for people of good character, because whether they’re Democrats or Republicans, they’re going to try to do the right thing.” 
“I haven’t changed any. It’s just the world has sort of changed around me, particularly the Republican Party.” 
He remembers feeling baffled that Republicans were supporting Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential primary, despite what he saw as problems with Trump’s character and “incredibly awful” personality. 
Howard — formerly a biology professor and hospital vice president who now leads a nonprofit health coalition in Western Kentucky — has maintained his Republican registration to have a voice in Republican primaries and “keep the worst of the worst” from the general elections in a state that allows only registered party voters to vote in party primaries. 
He’s taken part in local “pro-democracy” rallies led by former Madisonville city council member Mark Lee, in response to Trump’s second term in office.

He’s one of multiple organizers for the “No Kings” protest in Madisonville on Saturday, pointing to the Jan. 6, 2021 riot in the U.S. Capitol as a part of “continuous assaults” on the Constitution.
“I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. I took that seriously and still do,” Howard said. “He’s just blatantly and obviously going down a fascist, authoritarian pathway, and he’s making no bones about it. That is not American to me.” 
Howard said he’s convinced there is still a “very large group of center-right” people who are “hunkered down and keeping out of the way.”
“It’’s a tough sell, particularly in a small town like this,” Howard said. “Nobody wants to risk the social and economic ramifications of speaking out. They don’t want to lose potential customers or clients, and they don’t want to offend the person in the pew next to them on Sunday, which is understandable.” 
“We’ve got a lot of good people doing nothing, and the time has long passed for people — decent people of good will — to stand up and be heard,” he said. 
Central City: ‘I have no idea if anybody will show up. It doesn’t matter’
After retiring as an organist for her Baptist church in Muhlenberg County’s Central City, Karen Willis has been unable to get out as much as she once did because of chronic back issues. The 83-year-old still finds a way to keep in touch: the mail. 
“I’ve just taken to writing. I’ve always liked writing anyhow,” Willis told the Lantern by phone. “I send out note cards all the time to friends and acquaintances, for any reason or no reason.”

Her mother, who lived to be 96, saved cards she received and also wrote them. Willis sends upwards of a dozen cards a day, sometimes as far as England and Scotland, to her friends. 
“People appreciate them, and they’ll let you know somehow.” 
Last month, as MSNBC host Rachel Maddow talked about “No Kings” protests, she was inspired to write again. 
One of the recipients was Rhonda Wood, a retired math teacher at Muhlenberg County High School. The card from Willis was a declaration of what she was going to do on Oct. 18 — that she “MUST do something” — regardless of her physical limitations. 
“Oct. 18 will be a national ‘No KING’ event and it’s time we did something LOCAL,” Willis wrote in cursive. “I can stand on Broad Street and carry a sign — and I WILL.” 
For Wood, that was the spark that inspired her and others to start organizing the first “No Kings” protest in Central City, planned for the downtown square along Broad Street where statues of John Prine and The Everly Brothers stand as monuments to the region’s rich musical heritage.
“Knowing the condition and her pain she’s been in with her back, I said, ‘No, I’m going with you. I’m going to be there if you’re coming,’” Wood said. “She’s an encourager. She’s one who does that. She stays in touch with people that she knows are upset with the status quo.”
Wood said news of layoffs at the U.S. Department of Education amid the federal government shutdown hit her hard because of her decades as a public school educator; she especially worries about the future of special education. 
She said the organizers in Central City all have their individual reasons for taking part in the upcoming protest.

“I have an investment in Muhlenberg County, and I have a love for this county and the children. That’s why I can get so upset with what Trump’s done at the Department of Education,” Wood said.
Wood said even though she serves on a local committee for the county Democratic party, the protest is designed to be nonpartisan and to “draw people together and lift people up.” 
“Donald Trump may not see this personally, we want to be a drop in that bucket that he’s going to know is the crowd in the United States that’s come out in protest against his policies and what he’s doing to the American people,” Wood said. 
For Willis, the protest is just the latest in a long record of community involvement. She’s been a professional organist and pianist for churches and an actor, playwright and theater educator. The Kentucky Theatre Association named an award in her honor.
She said she has to answer to her conscience when she puts her head down at night, and her conscience urged her to join the protest. 
“Start where you are. Wherever you are, that’s your realm of influence. That’s your first step,” Willis said. “I have no idea what the reaction will be. I have no idea if anybody will show up. It doesn’t matter.” 
“Whether I’m in small, little Central City or if I live in New York City, I would be doing the same things,” she said.
 Northern Kentucky: ‘They’re grasping at straws’
Ann Dickerson helped found the Indivisible group in Northern Kentucky in 2017.
Ann Dickerson was convalescing from pancreatic cancer surgery during the runup to the 2016 election, leaving her lots of time to study the candidates. The first time she drove herself anywhere was to vote for Hillary Clinton.
“When the results were announced, I went to bed, I cried for three days, and then I got up, got up and said, ‘okay, I gotta do something now.’ That was my foray into politics.” 
After the Trump victory, a group of former congressional staffers put out a guidebook for Democrats advising how to adapt conservative Tea Party tactics to organize local protests and pressure elected officials. 
Not long after, Dickerson took the advice and helped found Indivisible Northern Kentucky, which will be rallying Saturday along the Florence Mall Road in Boone County.
“So everything that has happened since then originated with the Tea Party. Now nobody went around screaming that, oh, the Tea Party is getting paid. But now all of a sudden, because it doesn’t fit your agenda, because it’s happening by people who are capitalizing on the method that you used, now all of a sudden they’re getting paid to do it. Please.” 
She also scoffs at Republican claims that anti-Trump protesters are anti-American or aligned with terrorists.
“They’re grasping at straws. The fact of the matter is, we are everyday average American citizens who are fed up with what we’re seeing and what we’re feeling.”
She said the cost of living, especially the continued rise in grocery prices, is causing even some former Trump supporters to change camps — even in “deep red Kentucky.”
“We’re not losing anyone. We’re gaining people every single time we’re out on the streets.” 
On Saturday, there will be extra marshals who can communicate via walkie talkie with her at all times. After organizing protests across Northern Kentucky, she says the group has good relations with local police.
“I take the safety of every single person that shows up at one of these events very personally. It’s my number one issue in anything that we do.” 
Danville: ‘We want to preserve what our ancestors built together’
Kevin Maples
Kevin Maples calls it “preposterous and absurd” that “people in the highest levels of government are trying to paint as un-American people who are standing up for the rights of Americans, and I believe they know it’s absurd.”
Maples, who grew up in Lincoln County and worked in other states before settling in Danville almost 19 years ago, is part of Indivisible Danville, founded in 2017 by “predominantly women in their 50s and up.”
Their goal, he says, is to “shine a spotlight on the rising authoritarian bent of the Trump administration” and also to push Congress — especially Danville’s representative Republican James Comer — to step up.
“Congress has relinquished its power to Trump,” Maples said, enabling the president to misuse his emergency powers to enact questionable policies.
Turnout Saturday is expected to exceed “No Kings” protests in June, Maples said, because “people are upset.” They see their health care at risk because of Republican policies as tariffs “destroy” Kentucky’s soybean farmers, he said. 
After getting no response from Comer to requests for a town hall, Maples said, the group organized one in August. Hundreds of people showed up to question a cardboard cutout of the congressman.
Maples said he’s seen anti-Trump momentum build in 2025. “We believe deep down we are really in the majority. We want to preserve the democracy our ancestors built slowly and painfully. We’re not doing something radical. We’re trying to preserve something good. 
“We’re not lunatics. We’re retired teachers, retired social workers, librarians, small business owners. We have deep roots in Kentucky and our community. We want to preserve what our ancestors built together.”
Saturday will be a big day in Danville, he said. After the morning “No Kings” rally downtown, the community will celebrate its second Pride Festival which will be held at Pioneer Playhouse.

House Bill 1716 would prohibit declawing cats unless medically necessary. It also would require veterinarians to document the condition warranting the procedure by filing paperwork — including animal identification information and supporting lab work — with local animal control authorities. Republicans voted against this measure due to concerns it could “criminalize the veterinary medicine practices act,” according to Rep. Rob Kauffman (R-Franklin).
Declawing bans already are on the books in a handful of other states including New York as well as some municipalities in the commonwealth including Pittsburgh and Allentown. 
The other five bills passed out of committee with bipartisan support and an opposing vote from state Rep. Stephanie Borowicz (R-Union/Clinton). 
One would criminalize ear cropping — a procedure where dogs’ ears are basically trimmed so they don’t flop over — unless performed by a licensed veterinarian (the American Veterinary Association opposes ear cropping unless it’s medically necessary, such as to prevent infection). 
Another measure would establish mandatory reporting of aggravated animal cruelty to law enforcement by advocacy organizations like the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) as well as veterinarians, assistants and veterinary techs.

State law defines aggravated animal cruelty as torturing, killing or seriously harming an animal through intentional neglect or cruelty. 
“We really have a duty, I believe, to protect the most vulnerable. And, in my view, that’s always our children and our animals,” said prime sponsor Rep. Christina Sappey (D-Chester). 
House Bill 1932 would overhaul the commonwealth’s approach to sexual abuse of animals. Currently a misdemeanor, the offense would be elevated to a third-degree felony the first time and second degree for subsequent violations. The bill also calls for a five-year ban on perpetrators owning, living, working or volunteering with animals. 
Republican Rep. Kate Klunk is co-sponsoring the legislation after what she described as “a school bus of horrors arrived” in Adams County adjacent to her district in York County last year.
Ultimately, authorities rescued more than 30 animals — including birds, three German shepherds, a bull and a horse — and filed more than 200 counts of animal cruelty and neglect charges against Shawn Hirschbine and Deanna Huff. The Georgia couple had a history of animal cruelty spanning multiple states prior to their bus breaking down in Oxford Township — which led to officials discovering the bus, its “deplorable” conditions, severely neglected animals and video footage of Hirschbine having intercourse with them. 
Huff is now incarcerated in Adams County for between six and 23 months, a sentence reduced in exchange for testifying against Hirschbine – eventually. He has to get through a criminal trial in West Virginia over showing obscene content to a child before the Pennsylvania case can proceed, according to the Hanover Evening Sun.
Several animals have since been euthanized or died of malnutrition. Others have recovered and been adopted, per the Evening Sun.
“It really, truly shocks the public conscious and has really exposed some of our gaps in our criminal statutes,” Klunk said Wednesday. 
House Bill 1930 would enhance penalties for repeat offenders charged with aggravated cruelty to animals. Currently, the crime is a third-degree felony punishable by as many as seven years in prison. This legislation would elevate second and subsequent offenses to second-degree felonies, making the maximum sentence 10 years.
“There are times when horrific crimes call for penalties that fit,” said Rep. Melissa Shusterman (D-Chester), a cosponsor of the measure that she called “a necessary and rational deterrent.”
The sixth bill sets out a process for the state attorney general’s office to join district attorneys, at their discretion, in investigating felony animal cruelty cases.

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)Liberty is a core American value that is especially dear to Coloradans.
The state was established at a time when the nation’s founding principles underwent renewed appreciation and dramatic expansion, and it remains the kind of place where the governor is discussed as the most libertarian chief executive of any state.
That’s partly why the monarchy pretensions of the Trump administration are so repugnant to Coloradans, in addition to their shock at lawless immigration enforcement, acts of partisan cruelty and other federal outrages the state has endured this year.
One way residents have expressed antipathy toward the authoritarians in Washington is by showing up in large crowds to numerous local demonstrations, including a “Fighting Oligarchy” rally that U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said was the largest he had ever led and the No Kings “nationwide day of defiance” in June. During the second raft of No Kings demonstrations planned across the country on Saturday, including 50 throughout Colorado, organizers expect more than 12,000 residents to make their voices heard in downtown Denver.
The people’s contempt for crowns squares neatly with Colorado history.

Colorado voters approved the state constitution on July 1, 1876, three days before the nation celebrated its 100th year and the ideals extolled in the Declaration of Independence. The constitution was “first crafted in an era when the concept — if not the precise definition — of liberty and equality were ubiquitous in American culture and life,” noted Tom Romero, associate professor at the Sturm College of Law at the University of Denver.


Here is selected coverage of major Denver-area demonstrations and rallies against Trump administration policies since January.

Feb 5: Day of action
Feb 17: Presidents Day
March 21: Fighting Oligarchy
April 5: Hands Off! 
April 19: Hands Off!
May 1: Day without immigrants
June 9: ICE Out
June 10: ICE Out
June 14: No Kings 
July 17: Good Trouble Lives On
Aug. 2: Rage Against the Regime 



The centennial wasn’t the only reason the nation’s basic tenets were top of mind. The Civil War, during which a huge swath of Americans won liberty for the first time (in law, at least), was still a fresh national trauma. Colorado was the first state admitted to the union after adoption of the post-war “second founding” amendments — the 13th, 14th and 15th, prohibiting slavery, enacting birthright citizenship, establishing equal protection, mandating due process, and guaranteeing voting rights regardless of race.
The country was more anti-king than ever.
The state constitution was tuned to a diverse population in the Colorado territory, which included many Spanish-speaking residents. The original document called for laws to be printed in Spanish and German, and, 44 years before the 19th Amendment, it said the right to vote could be extended to women.
“The Colorado Constitution was drafted by a multiethnic collection of framers who felt the conflicting pressures surrounding the human rights demands of a diverse citizenry,” Romero said.
The constitution, reflecting 1870s reverence for the American spirit, at the outset enumerates a number of rights, many of which reiterate provisions of the national Bill of Rights, such as the right to free speech and “peaceably to assemble” — like in protest against a corrupt government.
But other rights Coloradans declared for themselves are absent from the U.S. Constitution. Colorado is one of 27 states that has a free elections clause in its constitution. “All elections shall be free and open,” it says, “and no power, civil or military, shall at any time interfere to prevent the free exercise of the right of suffrage.”
This Colorado right will be implicated if the Trump administration follows through on right-wing proposals that could result next year in military patrols of polling places and other forms of voter intimidation.
The administration has already committed innumerable constitutional offenses against Colorado residents. The most grievous involve its extreme program of immigration enforcement. An estimated 12 residents, denied basic due process rights, reportedly were sent to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has kept immigrant-rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra, who is not accused of a crime, locked up for more than six months. While ICE arrests have dramatically increased in the state, most detainees have no criminal record or pending criminal charge, according to a Denver Post analysis.
Trump’s disdain for laws is exemplified in Colorado by his demand that Tina Peters be set free, solely because she’s a supporter. Peters was convicted of four felonies by a jury for her role in a scheme to breach the security of her own election office when she was Mesa County clerk, but the local U.S. attorney’s office, in brazen disregard of the justice system’s supposed impartiality, jumped right in to help spring her from prison.
Trump has repeatedly abused presidential power to collectively retaliate against Coloradans, only because Democrats occupy the state’s top offices. After the federal government shut down this month, the administration canceled more than half a billion dollars worth of clean energy grants to the state. The White House budget director was explicit about the intention of the cuts, saying they targeted “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”
All this shameful behavior comes at a time when Trump is sending military troops into American cities as part of a baseless “law and order” mission, and there’s no reason to think Colorado will be spared a similar invasion.
This is what kings do.
The preamble of the state constitution mostly mirrors the U.S. Constitution’s opening words, including its commitment to “secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.” The Colorado framers in 1876 were thinking of later generations, which they hoped could enjoy the freedom, justice and welfare for which the constitution provided a basis.
The No Kings participants will be demonstrating to preserve those blessings for the present, but the welfare of future generations depends on their success.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Washington, D.C. metropolitan region leaders on Wednesday voted unanimously to exclude the I-495 Southside Express Lanes construction project from its long-range strategic plan, which had been proposed as a way to ease traffic congestion between Maryland and Virginia. 
The pitch to extend 11 miles of express lanes — stretching from the Springfield interchange in Fairfax County, across the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge, to the MD 210 interchange in Prince George’s County, Maryland — could return in the future, because the board directed the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) to improve it and report back next year on the status and outcomes of its work with all relevant jurisdictions.
Regional leaders on the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board, an independent body of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, were required to vote on adding the project to the board’s long-term strategic plan, Visualize 2050, which would be required for the project to receive federal funding. 
On Dec. 17, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments will take a final vote on the plan to submit to the Federal Highway and Transit Administrations under the U.S. Department of Transportation.
“The project is not dead,” said board Chair Walter Alcorn, who replaced former chair U.S. Rep. James Walkinshaw, D-Fairfax, after he was elected to Congress in September.
Alcorn said the board could add the project at a later time, but first, Virginia, Maryland and D.C. have to agree on the specific aspects of the expressway extension that advocates and opponents say will create significant impacts.
“The problem with this project is there’s not an agreement and consensus by the different jurisdictions through which the project would go,” Alcorn said. “There still needs to be more work to be done, but we’ll see. In my opinion, there does need to be some sort of project that would improve traffic now and in the future on the Beltway, and provide those transit options that we need all over the region.”

In a statement, VDOT said the board’s decision will allow the agency to continue its work with its development of the project, and to resubmit it in 2026 for inclusion in the region’s long-range transportation plan.
“These transportation improvements will provide near-term benefits and improve the lives of the hundreds of thousands of travelers who rely on the I-495 Southside corridor each day, as well as the surrounding residents and communities,” VDOT stated.
Since 2022, Virginia has been conducting a study on adding the express lanes, which public speakers at Wednesday’s meeting referenced. About 13 people spoke at the meeting, many in opposition to the project, with some noting that the state’s study lacked cost estimates for decommissioning private toll lanes in hopes of building a Metrorail line. Others said the express lanes would lead to an increase in vehicles and air pollution levels.
“Only by clearly weaving out the preferred alternative can the region ensure that there’s collaboration among jurisdictions to explore alternatives,” said Bill Pugh, transportation and climate director for the Coalition for Smarter Growth, emphasizing the need for sustainable transportation alternatives and what he called the negative environmental and social impacts of the project.
The project’s supporters say the express lanes would reduce travel times and provide more reliable arrival estimates for drivers. The express lanes would minimize vehicle idling and ultimately decrease pollution, those in favor of the project suggested. 
“It’s been said that what we need now is a 21st-century multimodal solution, and this project delivers exactly that solution,” said Richard Parsons, a representative of the Suburban Maryland Transportation Alliance. “It outperforms all other options in terms of expanding person throughput and reducing congestion delays, while preserving the right of way for future rail.”
Although Jason Stanford, a representative from the Northern Virginia Transportation Alliance, supports the project that provides “the greatest congestion relief,” he added that deferring the project would be a “wise decision” because “the stakes are too high to do nothing.”
Board members, including Virginia Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, voted unanimously to keep the project out of the long-term plan. She added that if the item had come down to an up-or-down vote, it would have failed due to concerns about the project’s environmental and community impacts.
“We feel this is a very important issue,” Boysko said. “We need to build consensus with the entire region.”
Other members, including Prince George’s County Councilmember Eric Olson, said they were pleased the board voted to exclude the project from the plan.
“I think we, as a region, came together and understood that this was not the right thing for the region and certainly not now,” Olson said. “There are a lot of unanswered questions, a lot of things that need to be looked at as far as the Woodrow Wilson Bridge corridor. We do need better transportation. We do need to look at alternatives — like transit, like transportation demand management — but it was not even close to being ready to be put into a regional plan to advance.”

Campaign finance reports show a stark contrast in fundraising between the two candidates. As of the latest filings, Taylor has raised about $634,734, while Pope Adams has brought in roughly $1 million, giving her a significant financial edge.
Their opposing party loyalties, however, could have major implications for House control and for three constitutional amendments moving through the General Assembly. 
Having already cleared once, the amendments must pass again next year before appearing on statewide ballots for voter approval or rejection. Two — guaranteeing same-sex marriage rights and restoring voting rights for ex-felons — advanced with bipartisan support earlier this year, while a third proposal to enshrine reproductive rights int the Virginia Constitution passed narrowly under Democratic control. Every Republican, including Taylor, voted against it. 
 Kimberly Pope Adams

Adams said her party can count on her to help shepherd the amendments across the finish line next year. 
She also wants to bring her financial background to the legislature if elected. Her experience as an accountant and auditor, she said, would make her an asset to the House Appropriations Committee. 
“It’s not just about counting the money. It’s about finding efficiency. It’s about finding process improvements. It’s about finding cost savings,” Adams said. 
She said the state budget is a top concern amid federal funding cuts, federal workforce layoffs and upcoming changes to hospital funding and Medicaid that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates could cause millions of Americans to lose health care. 
At the start of this year’s legislative session, Virginia lawmakers debated how to invest a budget surplus that Gov. Glenn Youngkin later withheld as a “cushion” for actions taken by President Donald Trump’s administration. He has since further touted the state’s rainy day fund, but has downplayed Virginia’s potential need to offset looming Medicaid losses. 
“These cuts are coming,” Adams said, adding that she wants the state to be ready. 
While reproductive rights loomed large over her 2023 race against Taylor, the issue remains central this year. In 2023, many Republicans supported a Youngkin-backed 15-week abortion limit. The proposal included exceptions for rape and incest but not for severe fetal anomaly exceptions —- many of which are not detected or confirmed until after 15 weeks. 
Though she lost that election, Adams shared her personal experience of having a miscarriage at 12 weeks. In her case, her body completed the miscarriage naturally, but she noted that some failed pregnancies require abortion medication or a dilation and curettage procedure to prevent infection and sepsis. 
The range of reproductive healthcare needs, she said, continues to drive her desire to serve in the legislature. On the constitutional amendments overall, Adams said it’s vital that Virginians have a chance to weigh in at the ballot box next year and critiqued her opponent for not supporting giving constituents the chance on the reproductive rights one. 
 Kim Taylor

As the co-owner of three auto repair shops with her husband, Taylor has brought her perspective as a small business owner to the legislature. 
Taylor has frequently appeared alongside Youngkin to promote the “Partnership For Petersburg,” an initiative he has spearheaded for several years to boost the local economy. 
In a 2023 statement to The Mercury, Taylor called the effort“ a great coalition” and said that her team had been in regular contact with voters in Petersburg. 
“They are optimistic about the future of Petersburg,” she wrote. “Like me, they are proud and want the best for their families, businesses and town.”
Taylor did not respond to interview requests for this article, so further details could not be discussed. However, The Mercury reviewed her past statements and campaign material to outline her priorities if re-elected. 
As a delegate, she has supported efforts to cut taxes and reduce government regulation. She has also aligned with her party in pushing to give parents more authority and input in public education decisions, such as curriculum content and access to gendered bathrooms. 
Recognizing the district’s rural makeup, Taylor has also supported expanding broadband access — a frequently bipartisan goal that can strengthen economic growth and telehealth services. 
With reproductive health again emerging as a key issue, Taylor has sought to strike a nuanced stance.
Earlier this year, she introduced a bill to codify protections for medical treatments addressing nonviable pregnancies. Because there is no national definition of viability, such determinations are usually made by physicians on a case-by-case basis. 
Under Taylor’s bill, a “nonviable pregnancy” was defined as one that “cannot result in a live-born infant, including an ectopic pregnancy or failed intrauterine pregnancy.”
Like Adams, Taylor has shared publicly that she experienced a miscarriage.
Her bill was effectively  blocked by Democrats, who control the chamber and did not schedule it for a committee vote. Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia Executive Director Jamie Lockart criticized the proposal at the time as a “political stunt” rather than a genuine effort to improve access to health care. 
Lockart argued that existing Virginia law already provides clear protections for most abortion and miscarriage care, along with guidance for later-stage procedures. 
“We hear so often from the other side that this is a health care crisis, and that women are dying because there is an unclear standard of care,” Taylor told The Mercury at the time.
“Miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies are nonviable pregnancies, and therefore cannot be confused with elective abortion procedures,” she said. “This would have put any doubt about the law to rest.” 
Taylor’s bill also gave her a chance to go on the record about an issue that has become a vulnerability for Republicans in recent years. Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion protections, Virginian Republicans have proposed a range of restrictions — from life-at-conception and near-total bans to the 15-week limit.
An early October poll by Christopher Newport University found that economic issues, inflation and threats to democracy were top concerns for Virginia voters, along with healthcare — a category that includes reproductive rights. Respondents gave Democrats the edge on handling major issues, according to the survey, which reported a 95% confidence level. 
With early voting under way and Election Day approaching, additional polling in the coming weeks could further clarify how those priorities may shape the outcome.

(Photo by Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)Carl Tobias, a professor and expert in constitutional law, called the “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education” that President Donald Trump’s administration wants the University of Virginia to sign to get federal funds exactly what it is.
“It’s a pact with the devil,” Tobias told me. “It is madness to enter that agreement.” 
Legislators in the Virginia Senate called it “political extortion,” which also seems an apt description of the compact. It offers the school federal funding in exchange for the university’s leaders “pledging to maintain neutrality on societal and political events, limit foreign entanglements such as capping the number of international students in the Student Visa Exchange Program, and meet strict equality and objective criteria in selecting students and staff,” the Virginia Mercury’s education reporter Nathaniel Cline wrote last week.
Va. Senate Dems call Trump admin’s UVA funding proposal ‘political extortion’

Leaders at UVA, one of nine U.S. universities Trump targeted, said they are carefully reviewing the compact but have so far resisted ceding control of school operations to a convicted felon whose pathological lying has proven that no contract he proposes is worth the paper it is written on.  UVA Rector Rachel Sheridan and Interim President Paul Mahoney told the federal government that they plan to keep running Virginia’s flagship university by applying rules of free and open debate that is reasoned and aimed at truth. This is what Thomas Jefferson envisioned when he established the school in 1817.
That charge should be enough for Trump if he truly wants academic excellence in higher education. He doesn’t. He wants to dictate how one of the finest universities in the country should behave. Trump and his underlings want UVA to reflect the political, social and religious agenda of the extreme right wing of the Republican party reflected in Project 2025, a plan to put an ultra-conservative stamp on America.
Tobias acknowledged that withholding federal funds lieu of an agreement with the compact puts UVA in a vulnerable position. Hundreds of millions of federal research dollars are on the line. At the same time, Democrats in charge of the state legislature have threatened to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars to UVA if it signs the compact.
To make any deal as important as the one outlined in the 10-page compact, both sides must trust each other, Tobias said. 
Based on Trump’s behavior defying the Constitution, ignoring federal court orders, and continuously lying during his first nine months in office, UVA “can make no agreement they can trust,” he told me.
Outside of a prohibition on violence and aggressive confrontations which has always existed at UVA, the compact leaves open to interpretation vague rubrics of behavior whose violation exists almost entirely in the eye of the beholder.
For instance, this sentence: “Civility includes protections against institutional punishment or individual harassment for one’s views.” It begs the question of what qualifies as “institutional punishment,” which  could cause the government to claw back research funds if UVA signs the compact.
This is especially true in the compact’s presumption of discrimination against conservative students. As part of it reads: “Signatories commit themselves to revising governance structures as necessary to create such an environment, including but not limited to transforming or abolishing institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas.”
At the University of Virginia, the suggestion of a campuswide conspiracy against conservatives is preposterous. UVA’s alumni include thousands of conservatives, many of whom have risen through the ranks of industry, business, and government.
Federal Appeals Court Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, a revered 1972 UVA Law School graduate, serves as an excellent, but by no means isolated, example. Republican President Ronald Reagan appointed Wilkinson to the federal bench in 1984 after he served in the Reagan administration Justice Department as a deputy attorney general.
I worked around Wilkinson, a polite, friendly man, when he served as editorial page editor of the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot from 1978-1982. He offered an unapologetic and uncensored voice for conservatism.
But Trump’s compact does not just envision free speech for conservatives. It demands institutional endorsement by falsely implying that UVA practices ideological discrimination and by imposing what it calls “institutional neutrality” that “requires policies that all university employees, in their capacity as university representatives, will abstain from actions or speech relating to societal and political events except in cases in which external events have a direct impact upon the university.”
On its face, this reduces academic experts in dozens of fields to little more than private voices whose opinions matter no more than a guy blogging crackpot conspiracy theories from his mother’s basement.
That is anathema to the marketplace of ideas that Thomas Jefferson trusted in. He believed in Americans’ ability to separate ideological wheat from chaff. 
In 2022, when some UVA students asked the school’s administration to rescind a speaking  invitation to Vice President Mike Pence because of his public statements against gay rights, school officials said no. The speech went on with a peaceful demonstration on UVA’s famous Lawn outside the auditorium. I know because I attended both the demonstration and the speech.
The Trump compact seems like an attempt to quash campus demonstrations, like those on Virginia campuses that supported the tens of thousands of Palestinians killed  by Israel in retaliation  for  a surprise attack and hostage-taking by the militant group Hamas two years ago.
UVA President Jim Ryan resigns amid federal ultimatum

Ironically, the Trump administration recently forced out UVA President Jim Ryan, who took action to tame those demonstrations, which had disrupted the campus. But Ryan still had to go, because in the Trump administration’s eyes, Ryan still believed in the American principle of opportunity and inclusion for all who live here.
The proposed compact is one more example of how Donald Trump wants to impose his personal political will and philosophy on a country where democracy dies without free speech.
Agreeing to disagree while still seeking truth should always be the American way. For centuries, it has been the UVA way.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)In Kentucky, patients drive up to two hours to see Dr. Manikya Kuriti, one of few endocrinologists who serve the rural communities surrounding Louisville.
Kuriti’s husband, a pulmonologist, drives from Louisville to small hospitals an hour south and north, in Indiana, to help small teams treat critically ill patients.
Rural communities have long struggled to recruit and retain doctors. Many rural hospitals are struggling financially, and have had to eliminate services or even shut down. The shortage of providers is critical in rural communities that tend to have higher rates of chronic illness and early death compared with their urban counterparts.
Many immigrant physicians help fill those gaps thanks in part to the H-1B visa, which allows skilled foreign workers to come work in the U.S. Both Kuriti and her husband came to the U.S. via the H-1B visa.
But last month, President Donald Trump announced a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas. The announcement quickly drew criticism from leading medical organizations, which say immigrant physicians make up a significant portion of the health care workforce. They’re concerned the move will hinder the flow of immigrant doctors to the U.S. and exacerbate the nation’s doctor shortage, which is expected to worsen in the coming decades.

Earlier this month, labor unions and other groups filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the administration over the payment. They argue that the move is unlawful and that the president doesn’t have the authority to circumvent Congress to collect such revenue. The plaintiffs — represented by the South Asian American Justice Collaborative, the Justice Action Center and others — include the AFL-CIO Committee of Interns and Residents and Global Nurse Force.
Last month, the American Medical Association and more than 50 other organizations sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security urging the administration to exempt international medical school graduates from the fee.
According to projections by the Association of American Medical Colleges, the U.S. could see a shortage of up to 86,000 doctors by the year 2036, the groups emphasized in the letter.
National interest
The president’s order says the secretary of homeland security can, at her discretion, waive the $100,000 requirement for prospective H-1B workers in specific industries if it’s in the “national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare” of the nation.
The AMA’s joint letter urges the secretary “to clarify that all physicians, including medical residents, fellows, researchers, and those working in nonclinical settings” are “critical to our national interest” and therefore exempt.
The Department of Homeland Security referred a Stateline request for comment to the White House, which hadn’t responded as of Thursday.
1.4M lawfully present immigrants could lose subsidized health coverage

Dr. Tom Price, who served as secretary of health and human services during Trump’s first term, said in an interview that medical workers should be exempt from the $100,000.
“A significant fee for any further H-1B visas in the area of the health care workforce will be detrimental … especially in low-served areas or rural areas,” said Price, a former Republican member of Congress.
In 2024, nearly a quarter of licensed physicians in the U.S. were foreign-trained and roughly 46% of foreign-trained physicians practiced in rural areas, according to data from the Federation of State Medical Boards cited by the AMA. And between 2001 and last year, almost 23,000 H-1B physicians worked in communities considered underserved.
Trump and other critics of H-1B visas say that some employers, especially tech companies, have abused the program by using it to replace native-born workers with foreigners who will work for less, rather than using it to fill jobs they can’t find Americans to do. But tech companies would have an easier time paying the fee than many hospitals.
Elizabeth Ricci, a Tallahassee, Florida-based immigration lawyer and national expert in immigration law, said at least one hospital in the South has asked her whether it must pay the fee itself or whether it can pass it on to the prospective physician. Before the new $100,000 fee, employers had to pay between $2,000 and $5,000 for each potential H-1B employee.
“It’s probably going to require litigation to get that guidance,” Ricci said. “And in the meantime, people aren’t filing because they are concerned that they’re going to be responsible for $100,000,” Ricci added.
The University of Washington said it has paused H-1B visa petitions.
“The uncertainty around visas creates a significant disruption for talented individuals who hope to train and work at UW Medicine,” Dr. Tim Dellit, CEO of UW Medicine and dean of the UW School of Medicine, wrote in email to Stateline. “It represents a loss for the research and education communities, as well as for the vital clinical care we provide on behalf of our patients and the broader community.”
Iowa, West Virginia and North Dakota — conservative-leaning, largely rural states — had the largest share of physician applicants under the H-1B visa relative to total physicians, according to a study published in July in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.
‘The need is there’
When Dr. Sridevi Alla arrived in Mississippi two decades ago, she was part of a small team of hospitalists at a rural clinic in Kosciusko, in the central part of the state. She now practices in Jackson, and on any given day, she could be treating patients having a stroke, complications from untreated diabetes, or someone with dangerously high blood pressure.

“In a state which already has a physician shortage, I think that’s definitely going to affect primary care,” Alla said, referring to the payment.
Alla said she considers herself a Mississippian, and that she’s always felt welcomed and valued by hospital leadership and patients.
“We never felt [like] foreigners in the medical community,” she said. “Maybe from an immigration standpoint we are, but not around being a part of health care.”
She noted Mississippi’s high rates of diabetes, heart disease, infant mortality and poverty.
“This is where I was trained. I sincerely feel like the need is there,” she said. “Even though maybe there are opportunities out [there], I never sincerely looked outside because I felt this is the home after home.”
Four-year limit proposal
Many physicians come to the U.S. under the temporary J-1 visa, which allows medical graduates to come for training and graduate medical education. They are then required to return to their home countries for at least two years. But they can apply for a waiver to stay if they work in rural or underserved communities, which allows them to transfer to an H-1B visa.
In addition to the new $100,000 fee, the administration has proposed a four-year limit on how long J-1 visa holders can stay in the U.S.
Medicaid cuts may disproportionately affect Black, Latino doctors and their patients

AMA President Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, a Flint, Michigan, otolaryngologist, said both his parents immigrated to the U.S. from India to complete their medical residencies.
“In that same hospital where they did their training back in 1970, here in 2025, we still have 30 to 35 international medical graduates that come in,” he said.
Now, hospitals have to “figure out where we’re going to get $100,000 per doctor.”
“We need to not just have the physicians talking about this, but to add to that the understanding of our own lawmakers,” he said.
Dr. Mette Strand, an internal medicine physician at Livingston HealthCare, a 25-bed critical access hospital serving rural Montana, emigrated from Norway. Many of those who mentored her, including specialist colleagues, are immigrants, too.
“Cutting IMGs [international medical graduates], we would be in further need of doctors in an already underserved state,” she said. “I would have a hard time seeing how we would run our hospitals and our clinics.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The growing backlog of bridges and public buildings in need of repair or replacement poses an increasing threat to state finances, but tracking of maintenance liabilities varies wildly across the states.
That reality is examined in a new analysis published Thursday by the Volcker Alliance, a nonprofit that supports public sector workers, along with The Pew Charitable Trusts and the Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota.
The analysis implores states to urgently adopt better methods to identify, quantify and fund their deferred infrastructure maintenance. 
“The cliff is here,” said William Glasgall, one of the researchers and a public finance adviser at the Volcker Alliance. “The bridges aren’t getting any newer, the water treatment plants aren’t getting any newer.”
Responsibility for public infrastructure has been increasingly falling on state and local governments. 
With an estimated $1 trillion in aging public infrastructure needs, states will continue to confront steeper bills as the federal government pulls back support of major projects, Glassgall said. Since January, President Donald Trump’s administration has stripped states and cities of billions of dollars that Congress approved for education, infrastructure and energy projects. Last month, for example, the White House announced it would hold $18 billion for subway and rail tunnel projects already underway in New York City.
Half the states don’t have enough money to cover all their bills, report finds

“The political reality is that this administration and this Congress are telling the states, you’ve got to live much more by your own wits,” he said. 
While states routinely report their debts for construction projects or pension obligations, deferred maintenance is more scattered: The new analysis found 20 states make no mention of deferred maintenance in their capital budgets at all. And definitions vary over what constitutes deferred maintenance — upkeep to maintain infrastructure in good working order that was planned but has been postponed. 
Putting off maintenance too long can pose real economic and safety issues, Glasgall noted. 
Rhode Island’s Washington Bridge connecting Providence and East Providence is a prime example. In 2023, state officials closed the bridge’s four westbound lanes after at least two anchor rods meant to keep the structure from shaking were broken, jeopardizing the span. The failure created a political scandal in the state and will cost an estimated $428 million to replace over several years.
Still, some states have taken recent steps to tackle their maintenance backlogs. 
In August, Massachusetts Democratic Gov. Maura Healey signed legislation delivering over $1 billion in infrastructure funds to cities and towns, including $200 million for culverts, small bridges and other long-deferred maintenance work.  
She has proposed dedicating $2.5 billion over 10 years to capital projects on higher education campuses across the state, saying many college buildings opened in the 1970s and were “aging and increasingly unable to meet modern demands.” Lawmakers are considering the legislation. 
In 2023, Oklahoma lawmakers passed the Legacy Capital Financing Act to provide funding for capital projects, including deferred maintenance. The next year, lawmakers approved an annual $75 million fund to address deferred maintenance of higher education, tourism and other state facilities. 
Education and transportation are major drivers of state deferred maintenance needs nationally, said one of the researchers, Camila Fonseca-Sarmiento, director of fiscal research at the University of Minnesota’s Institute for Urban & Regional Infrastructure Finance.
The new analysis provides a look at all 50 states’ approaches to deferred maintenance and a deep dive into the policies in 10 states — from Alaska to Tennessee — for assessing and funding deferred maintenance. The study says those states can serve as models for others that have yet to address the growing challenge. 
“They are putting more attention into deferred maintenance,” Fonseca-Sarmiento said, “and they’re trying to recognize it as a problem.”

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced a resolution to encourage Ohioans to safely store their guns so children stop dying, as actual firearm regulation legislation sits stagnant in the Republican-dominated legislature.
Year after year, tragedy strikes in cases where unsecured guns turn into accidental shootings.
Just in the last few months, an Akron 10-year-old was accidentally shot in the face while with a friend. A Cleveland 14-year-old was accidentally shot and killed after a gun went off in a car. An Elyria 15-year-old was also accidentally shot. A 1-year-old had to undergo surgery after a teen accidentally shot him.
These are just some of the 2025 cases, but we’ve covered dozens throughout the years — ranging from babies to toddlers to teens to adults.
Another problem facing Ohio is when cars are broken into to steal guns.
State Rep. Darnell Brewer, D-Cleveland, is trying to target the problem.
“We can encourage people to one, honor the Second Amendment; and two, safely store their guns,” Brewer said.


He and state Rep. Kelly Deeter, R-Norwalk, have put forward Ohio House Resolution 148. It encourages Ohioans to store and secure their weapons and pushes cities and organizations to have safety campaigns.


Cincinnati already has a few, including a program where gun owners can store their firearms at the police department for up to six months for free.
“When the grandkids are coming over… when someone in the home is having a mental health crisis — there are all kinds of reasons where people feel having a gun inside their home is not safe at that time,” Cincinnati Vice Mayor Jan-Michele Kearney said.
The City of Columbus has been trying to curb this problem for years.
The Ohio Supreme Court is hearing a challenge to a Columbus ordinance requiring owners to lock up their guns.
State Rep. Josh Williams encourages safe storage to prevent deaths, but said there can’t be a requirement.
“I understand that these situations occur, but that doesn’t mean that you can violate the constitutional rights of every other law-abiding citizen,” Williams said.
Brewer was asked about the likelihood that this resolution could pass after Ohio Republican lawmakers have repeatedly passed laws to remove gun restrictions and refused to pass laws that put any restrictions on gun ownership.
“Hopefully we tell the story,” Brewer said, detailing incidents of a toddler being shot in Columbus, and the 2023 case of a pregnant Huron County woman who was killed with her baby also not surviving, after her two-year-old shot her.
“We’re trying to move the Republicans to change their heart and their minds.”
Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein said they need real change.
“I applaud the bipartisan effort to engage in this important public safety conversation. We know that safe storage saves lives. It’s why Columbus Public Health has led efforts to educate parents and distribute free gun locks, and it’s why the City of Columbus passed our safe storage ordinance,” Klein said in a statement.
He then targeted the lawmakers.
“Ohioans want and support reasonable gun laws that protect families and children, but we know that real change cannot happen unless lawmakers find the political will to pass laws that will save lives. This resolution is a step in the right direction and should be applauded. We pledge to work with any legislators who are serious about doing what we can to protect the lives of Ohio’s children through commonsense measures like safe storage,” he added.
Klein and activists like Moms Demand Action want gun lock-up requirements, universal background checks, and red flag laws — all of which Brewer agrees with.
“This is hopefully a step in the right direction, a small step,” Brewer said.
The City of Cleveland explained some of its campaigns, like CPD’s Community Relations Unit, which teaches gun safety classes to kids at schools.
That team has also worked with organizations to promote safe storage, along with distributing gun locks. Cincinnati libraries and schools do something similar.
“The City has also helped promote awareness through other avenues – like lighting up Tower City orange for National Gun Violence Awareness Day and coordinating pledge signing events for youth, which we will do again tomorrow,” spokesperson Tyler Sinclair said.
“More than 1,000 kids signed the pledge at 20 rec centers across Cleveland last year. We appreciate the thoughts behind the resolution and welcome further tangible action.”
Neither Columbus nor Cleveland addressed the fact that no money would be provided to municipalities or community partners from the state to promote public awareness on safe storage. The City of Cincinnati didn’t respond to comment at all.
“Unfortunately, there would be no financial help,” Brewer said. “I do have a bill, again, to try to give financial help to cities who do violence interventions.”
The lawmaker said because it’s just encouragement, not a mandate, his resolution has a higher likelihood of passing the GOP-controlled legislature.
Leadership
It seems that Gov. Mike DeWine has the same goal as Democrats like Klein, yet he has signed every bill loosening firearm restrictions that have hit his desk — even after a 2019 mass shooting in Dayton.
After the deadly Minneapolis school shooting this summer, we asked DeWine about his plans.
“Look, I’ve tried some different things,” the governor told us in August. “And we’ve not gotten them through.”
We tried to follow up with him on Tuesday on whether there was anything he could do about safe storage, but he said it was all legislative.
“To my knowledge, everything that could be done in regard to safe storage is legislative. Now, look, we talk about it, we can talk about the problem,” he responded.
“We want to make people aware of the problem. We certainly have done that; We’re going to continue to do that.”
Some Democrats and advocates are now pushing for a constitutional amendment to put gun safety regulations into law.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)At any given meeting, the New Hampshire Executive Council can face 100 separate state contracts to approve or deny. And those contracts can be accompanied by 10 or 20 pages of materials.
It’s a staggering amount of paperwork that can amount to 1.3 million printed pages per year. And this month, Gov. Kelly Ayotte is attempting to change that decades-old system and eliminate the printed packets, which her office says costs about $200,000 per year. 
But Republican councilors have countered that attempt with complaints of their own, claiming the Ayotte administration has not provided crucial documents to accompany the contracts it wants the board to approve. 
On Wednesday, the conflict boiled over at an especially tense council meeting. Councilors accused Ayotte’s departments of withholding documents from the contract packets. In protest, Republicans voted to table a wide range of contracts, seeking to disrupt Ayotte administration priorities until agencies agree to provide the information. 
One after the other, the council took up proposed contracts from a number of the state departments. And one after another, Republicans voted to withhold approval at least until its next meeting in two weeks.
Among the held-up items: $3 million in state funds to support the Child Advocacy Centers; $3.3 million in state and federal funds toward the Homeless Management Information System; $1.2 million in federal funds to preserve a bridge in Raymond; $640,000 in state funds for youth substance use reduction; $276,000 in state and federal funds for adult education and literacy programs; $170,000 in juvenile justice educational programs; and $849,000 in state funds to buy Coca-Cola products for state parks and New Hampshire Hospital vending machines. 
The council also tabled a $10,000 request by the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources to reimburse for the temporary fences it set up to manage crowds within Franconia Notch during this year’s foliage season. 
“So the vendor provided the service that was needed, correct?” asked Councilor Karen Liot Hill of Lebanon, the lone Democrat on the council. “It was,” replied Department of Natural and Cultural Resources Commissioner Sarah Stewart. 
“It proved to be useful?” Liot Hill continued. “Yes,” Stewart said. 
“And now they are not going to be paid for the services,” Liot Hill concluded. 
Councilor Dave Wheeler, a Milford Republican, said the holdup in contracts was necessary to make clear to the governor that she should require her departments to provide more information. That includes, for instance, a list of the board of directors of a state contractor, or the secretary of state’s certificate of good standing, documents that he said have been included in the past. 
“Our concern is we need all the information we need to make good decisions,” he said to reporters after the meeting. “… We’re not saying the government overall and the agencies aren’t doing a good job, but we’re here — that’s our constitutional function, to be a check on the executive.” 
Wheeler said he and other councilors have been pressing the governor to provide the information behind the scenes for months. He and others, including Councilor John Stephen, a Manchester Republican, brought up the request publicly at the Oct. 1 meeting. When the materials for Wednesday’s meeting were released without the requested extra documents, Wheeler, Stephen, and Councilor Joseph Kenney, a Wakefield Republican, planned to table the items in protest, he recalled.
Wheeler said he would be happy to vote for the tabled items as soon as possible, potentially via an emergency meeting over the phone, as soon as the departments requesting each item provide the additional information.
“The items we’ve tabled today, I am willing to come in, in between meetings, if you want to call a special meeting to expedite anything that needs to be expedited,” he said to Ayotte at the end of the meeting. 
Adding to some councilors’ frustration was Ayotte’s push to fully digitize the Executive Council’s paperwork process. 
Every two weeks, each of the five executive councilors receives printed copies of all contracts and other items that will come up at the next meeting, delivered to their home by a State Police trooper. Delivering the boxes takes up about 240 total hours of State Police time per year, the governor’s office said in a statement Tuesday. 
In announcing her plan to make the contracts digital, Ayotte said it would save taxpayers money and allow the State Police — who are facing a shortage of 57 officers — to better use its personnel. She also said the move would increase transparency.
Some on the council, like Stephen, have embraced the digitization idea. But Wheeler, a Christmas tree farmer, opposes it, arguing printed copies better suit his lifestyle. 
“I’m loading dump trucks,” he told reporters. “When there’s no dump truck there, I’m reading my agenda. I can’t do that (with) no cell service. I can’t do that.”
Wheeler dismissed a suggestion that the state provide councilors with printers to print out contracts on their own. But asked whether he would accept Ayotte’s digitization plan in exchange for a promise of more documentation, he demurred.
“A good negotiator never gives out his final answer,” he said.
For her part, Ayotte said she would look into providing the requested documents, but added she is committed to her plan of digitization. “We are going to look and see what of those items can we put online, and how do we get that information in a way that’s more transparent for everyone,” she said. 
One of the tabled contracts — to use $708,000 in federal funds to reconstruct a portion of Route 12 in Charlestown — sparked particular controversy. Liot Hill, who represents Charlestown, denounced the decision by Wheeler, Stephen, and Kenney to table those particular funds, noting that the road has been reduced to one lane for months, and that construction must begin soon in order to finish before the winter.
“I understand his concerns. I share the frustrations. But it is not right for my constituents to be used as collateral,” she said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_0575-1024x563.jpg,,,2025-10-16 05:56:38.462639

(Getty Images.)Ohio state senators are trying to overhaul the program plugging orphaned oil and gas wells. A new measure, Ohio Senate Bill 219, proposes a dedicated fund for the effort, and streamlines notice requirements before work begins.
The bill also makes a handful of industry friendly changes. The bill makes it easier for drillers to get expedited review of projects, limits liability after a well owner sells one of their wells and nixes a requirement for drillers to make road-use agreements with local governments.
The bill’s sponsor, state Sen. Al Landis, R-Dover, explained the industry has changed “vastly” since the last substantial rewrite of oil and gas regulations during the Kasich administration.
“I hope this bill is the first step in updating Ohio’s occasionally outdated laws when it comes to realities of the oil and gas industry,” he said. “Once again, energy is national security. In Ohio, our state plays a pivotal role in supporting it.”
Plugging wells
The Ohio Department of Natural Resources has been managing the state’s orphan well program since the late 1970s. One of the largest sources of funding is the state’s severance taxes — fees imposed on the volume of gas or oil a company extracts.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
State law directs a share of that money toward the orphan well program, but Landis said, in the past, the oil and gas fund has been “fair pickings” for lawmakers looking for cash.
“When the state has a situation or something come up and they feel they need, some extra money, or some money that maybe not really available, they look to this fund,” he said.
Landis used to represent Harrison and Belmont Counties, two places he described as hot spots for drilling in the past. Up until the 1960s, there was little in state law governing who could drill and where. As a result, there are now thousands of abandoned wells throughout Ohio.
To speed up well plugging efforts, the bill eliminates most of the notice requirements when a landowner finds an abandoned well on their property.
Under current law, state officials have to inform prior owners by mail and offer them a chance to remove equipment. Landis’ bill only requires they publish notice in a newspaper or on the ODNR website.
“Right now, we’re plugging at a rate of about 500 per year with ODNR, they’re working very diligently,” Landis said. “And they would certainly like to increase that up to 1,000 wells a year and pick up the pace. Protecting the fund is the first step.”
To protect the orphan well program, Landis’ bill creates a dedicated fund called the Oil and Gas Resolution and Remediation Fund.
The bill earmarks certain filing fees and money from penalties; the fund will keep any interest it generates as well. The measure makes no change to the share of severance taxes dedicated to orphan wells.
State Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, asked if they should consider raising severance taxes to speed up the effort. Landis sidestepped.
Ohio’s Orphan Well Program has plugged more than 1,200 abandoned wells in last five years

“My opinion is volume, volume, volume,” Landis said.
Instead of increasing taxes to grow the orphan well fund, Landis argued the measure would grow it by increasing production.
“We’re solidifying the oil and gas industry in Ohio,” he said, “so that we’re not losing any opportunity to increase production.”
Promoting the industry
At the same time Landis is working to plug old wells, his measure makes a handful of changes that could make it easier to drill new ones.
Most notable, the legislation eliminates ODNR’s ability to turn down requests for expedited review.
Under the bill, a well owner can only submit 10 such requests in a calendar year, but state officials have to get the ball rolling.
The measure also drops existing requirements for horizontal drilling operations to make a good faith effort reach a road maintenance and use agreement with local governments.
The proposal makes those agreements voluntary and caps their duration at three years. Drillers and local officials can renew agreements, though.
Additionally, Landis’ bill would simplify the liabilities and obligations a well owner faces when they sell or transfer a well, potentially making it a bit easier to walk away.
Under current law, the seller maintains full responsibility over the well until the buyer files information about ownership, purchases liability insurance and posts a surety bond or proof of financial responsibility.
The new proposal would allow either party to file information about the new owners and purchase the liability insurance.
The buyer is still required to prove their financial responsibility, but so long as the other boxes are checked, the seller is in the clear.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)America is in week three of a government shutdown, and the ability of hundreds of thousands of Kansas families to afford health care is on the line.
Debate about whether to fund enhanced health care tax credits, which make health care more affordable, has prompted the current government halt.
This is a health care shutdown, and the stakes are high for the more than 200,000 Kansans who buy their health insurance plans through the federal government’s Health Insurance Marketplace. If Congress fails to fund these health care tax credits, Kansas families will see explosive increases in health care costs.
The health care tax credits make plans in the Marketplace more affordable for low- and middle-income Americans. It allows farmers, contract workers, self-employed individuals and those working for small family businesses that don’t offer insurance to have coverage. Enrollment in the Marketplace doubled from 2021 to 2025 after Congress enhanced the tax credits and made them available to more people.
However, these health care tax credits are set to expire at the end of 2025. Not extending them will cause rates to double, leading to more people becoming uninsured. Data shows average Marketplace premium payments in Kansas will increase by 77% should Congress fail to act.
As tensions rise in D.C. over this issue, it’s important to understand how it impacts Kansans directly. Not funding the health care tax credits is cutting health care for families, making it exponentially harder to afford health insurance and care.
This comes at a time when the majority of Kansans already feel the economy is making life harder for families, particularly those raising young children. Nonpartisan research that the United Methodist Health Ministry Fund recently released found that 84% of Kansans voiced this concern, and 77% said Kansas families with young children are struggling with just everyday costs.
Families are already deeply concerned about health care costs, too, and that’s without this potential spike if Congress doesn’t fund the health care tax credits. The Health Fund’s research showed health care was Kansans’ top concern, with 90% of those worried about the cost of care, followed by 89% highlighting cost of living and 85% identifying the cost of food as a challenge.
As families in Kansas struggle to afford health care and day-to-day living, it’s not a surprise that the latest KFF Health Tracking Poll found that 78% of adults said Congress should extend the health care tax credits. That is more than three times the share of the public — at 22% — who say Congress should let the credits expire.
The rise in costs by not extending the health care tax credits would be steep. A 60-year-old couple making $82,000 would see premiums increase by more than $18,000 annually, according to KFF. And, a family of four (ages 45, 45, 15, and 10) earning $129,800 a year would see premiums increase by $10,294 annually, according to Keep Americans Covered. With everyday budgets stretched, these steep price hikes will hit pocketbooks hard.
Ultimately, the steep increases in prices are expected to cause about 108,000 Kansans to lose health coverage over the next decade.
Kansans don’t want policies that cut health care or programs that make the cost of living more affordable for families. The opposite is true — 69% of Kansans feel government is already doing too little to help families, especially those with young children.
Eliminating these health care tax credits makes it tougher for families to afford everyday life, stay healthy and put food on the table for their kids. It would also take choices away from Kansans by making it tougher to switch jobs or start a new business.
Also, these cuts would have a ripple effect. When more people become uninsured due to unaffordability, that puts Kansas hospitals and providers at greater financial risk as they take on more uncompensated care. We cannot afford that risk, as Kansas already has more financially vulnerable hospitals than any other state.
Increases in the number of uninsured Kansans drives up health care costs for everyone else, as we pay the price for covering the uncompensated care for the uninsured. By failing to extend the health care tax credits, Congress is gambling with the health and economic security of Kansans and the rural health care system.
However, there’s a way to avoid these devastating cuts that would hurt families and hospitals alike: extend the health care tax credits. We can end this health care shutdown and keep health care affordable. It’s what Kansas families want.

When the law only recognizes two sexes, male and female, and defines them as “not changeable and… grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality” — what happens to intersex people like me? 
Reality is much messier than the budget’s new definition suggests. 
Nearly 2% of people are born with sex traits that fall outside the male/female sex binary, with as many as 1 in every 1000 born with “ambiguous genitalia.”
Ohio budget would only recognize two sexes, excluding transgender community and intersex people

Historically, strict adherence to a sex binary leaves intersex infants vulnerable to traumatic, irreversible medical attempts to conform the infant to a male or female body. 
For decades throughout the 20th century to the present, when an infant was born with ambiguous genitalia, pediatric surgeons and specialists chose which sex they felt that the infant conformed with — then enforced that sex with cosmetic, sometimes sterilizing genital and gonadal surgeries. 
Many intersex people describe these surgeries as nonconsensual “intersex genital mutilation” (IGM) because they do not have direct health justifications and can often cause increased risk of urinary tract infections, osteoporosis, cancer, and other complications. 
As children age into adults, they may experience loss of fertility, loss of sexual response, and significant trauma and mental health effects, impacting their future health care.
The Center for American Progress found that 3 in 5 intersex adults avoided seeking medical care due to past discrimination, and 9 in 10 intersex adults report poor physical and/or mental health, many from nonconsensual surgeries and their lifelong impacts. 
No federal or state law protects intersex infants against continued medical violence. 
Because the new state budget forces infants to be identified only as either “male” or “female” on birth certificates, there may be increased pressure for parents to accept coercive sex ‘correction’ on their children. 
The state budget, which went into full effect on Sept. 30, 2025, does not make exceptions for intersex individuals. 
Instead, it struggles to clearly and cohesively describe what “sex” means, defining “sex” as “the biological indication of male and female, including sex chromosomes, naturally occurring sex hormones, gonads, and nonambiguous internal and external genitalia present at birth.” 
(As many biologists have noted, the exact language from the state budget, which is modeled on President Trump’s Jan. 25 Executive Order, also incorrectly describes fetal sexual differentiation and classifies every American as female.) 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, those sex traits may conflict within intersex bodies. 
For example, infants with Complete or Partial Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome may present with externally “female” genitalia, internally “male” gonads, XY chromosomes, and an inability to produce testosterone. 
The state budget does not explain how it will classify infants with ambiguous genitalia and sex characteristics. 
The ramifications for intersex people whose existence is not recognized under the law are still uncertain.
This is especially true in Ohio, which is seventh in the nation for the most children’s hospitals within the state. 
Many of these clinics treat a disproportionate amount of intersex infants. 
Shriners Children’s Hospital houses pediatric urologists who explicitly treat “sexual development disorders” and “hypospadias,” both intersex variations.
Nationwide Children’s Hospital has a specialty Turner Syndrome Clinic and “treats” other forms of intersex variations. 
Up to 150 infants per year may be born in the state with ambiguous genitalia, and others may travel from surrounding states to specialty pediatric hospitals, all of whom are at increased risk for coercive procedures due to the state budget provisions.
For intersex teenagers and adults, the binary definition does not bode well either. 
The law has the potential to restrict IDs and social services, including prohibiting funds to mental healthcare providers that “promote or affirm social gender transition.” 
These regulations may disproportionately affect intersex individuals, who are more likely to be perceived as gender nonconforming (whether or not they are also transgender) and to experience mental health conditions. 
The full scope of the harm that the state budget will cause to intersex Ohioans has yet to be determined, but one thing is clear: It will cause harm.

Unidentified masked agents disappearing law-abiding immigrants. 
Members of the U.S. National Guard deployed against fellow citizens. 
Rampant corruption, suppression of free speech, weaponization of government against political opponents.
And the biggest rollback in federal support for health coverage ever, which includes congressional Republicans’ refusal to extend insurance subsidies that would keep premiums from increasing as much as 117% for tens of thousands of Mainers next year.  
Those unhappy with the actions of the federal government are expected to turn out en masse this weekend for the second national “No Kings” day of action. 
“What else can we do?” asked Scarborough resident Abigail Henry. “We have to tend to our gardens,” she said, explaining that she feels a responsibility to stand up against injustice in her community.
Last week, Henry co-organized a demonstration targeting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center in her town.

Organizers estimate that roughly 70 people attended the event, calling for due process for all regardless of immigration status, transparency about the agency’s actions, and support for local law enforcement, so they can “focus on community policing and not be pulled into ICE’s authoritative terrorism happening all around this country,” Henry said.
“These small actions can be cumulative over time and we can make the change we need if we want to hold onto our identity as a nation,” Henry said.
Last spring, residents of Wells organized a series of demonstrations and turned out for public meetings against the police department’s contract with ICE, which has since been paused. And in Portland there’s been mounting pressure on the Cumberland County Board of Commissioners to to stop housing people for federal immigration authorities.
Further protests are coming on Saturday. 
At least 20 No Kings protests are scheduled across Maine as part of more than 2,500 that will take place nationally. Actions, small and large, are planned in communities including Machias, Dexter and Oxford Hills. 
National organizers hope to build on the momentum of the June 14 day of action, which drew more than five million people across all 50 states. 
“Together, millions will send a clear and unmistakable message: we are a nation of equals, and our country will not be ruled by fear or force,” they said in a written statement.
The events are being sponsored by more than 100 organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the League of Women Voters, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Common Cause, and Indivisible.
“This feeling of hopelessness and helplessness, that’s what this authoritarian administration wants so they can get away with their agenda,” Henry said.
She plans to attend the demonstration in Portland, Maine, where over 3,000 people marched in June.
“If you say you are opposed to facism, this is the time to really put those words into action,” Henry said. “Things are happening really quickly, and we are only less than a year into this administration. And if we don’t start turning the tide now, it’s going to get really scary, really fast.”

On Wednesday evening, the first 300 evacuees embarked on a C-17 military transport plane from Bethel to make the one-hour journey to Anchorage and emergency shelter there.
“Just devastated, feeling heartbroken, displaced,” said Jody Agimuk of Kipnuk, standing with his wife Kristin, and their five young children, waiting in line to board in the Alaska Army National Guard hangar.

“I hope we find a place,” he said of arriving in Anchorage. “It’s hard to explain, I hope we won’t have a hard time finding a place.”
He said since the storm hit Sunday, they sheltered at their grandmother’s and one night at the local school, and evacuated on Wednesday. “It’s just hard — leaving families at home, separating with families that we were close to. People we’ve seen, people we knew, people we used to talk to, all the close relatives, it’s heartbreaking seeing people separating.” 
The rest of the village of Kipnuk is scheduled to be evacuated on Thursday, and Kwigillingok by Friday, said Lieutenant Colonel Brendan Holbrook, commander of the 207th Aviation Troop Command with the Alaska Army National Guard. 
He said roughly 500 people had been evacuated to Bethel so far out of those two villages by members of the Alaska Army National Guard and Alaska Air National Guard. The C-17 plane can only transport 300 people, so the rest would shelter in Bethel overnight and more flights would be available out to Anchorage on Thursday morning. 
“I have five aircraft, four UH-60s and CH-47 in support operations, doing evac. And we’ve been running basically 12 to 14-hour operations every day getting these people onto safety,” he said.

In the Alaska Army National Guard Readiness Center in Bethel, evacuees waited, some resting on cots, as officers read lists of names and groups of 30 people at a time boarded the plane. 
Holbrook said evacuation was self-organized by community members, with families with children and elders prioritized. 
“So it was primarily Kipnuk today, if the call comes back, we can do Kwig (Kwigillingok) tomorrow,” he said ”But prioritization was just who was available and ready to go. So we would go to both and whoever got on got on. Kipnuk just happened to be, they had already established a marshaling plan, so as soon as we landed, they were ready with people to just start loading.”
Those who did not get on the Wednesday evening flight were sheltering in Bethel, some in an emergency shelter across the road from the Readiness Center hanger, administered by the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation with the support from the American Red Cross. Cots, showers and meals were provided there.
Holbrook added that there is a misconception that evacuees must go to Anchorage. He said once in Bethel, regional tribal organizations like the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation are providing support for people to travel wherever they like. “If you have a place to go, another village, family, somewhere else, Y-K will help you get to where you need to go,” he said.

Space X wants to close it for at least two months a year and maybe more. (via National Park Service)This is such a breakable age. Things we thought would last are, to our surprise, now in danger of shattering.
You think our state parks will always be preserved? Nope, we’re going to try to put golf courses in them. Think the Everglades will be protected forever? Sorry, we’re building a prison camp there. Think our system for buying environmental land will be free of political influence? Too bad, here’s a shady campaign contributor getting $83 million for four acres in Destin.
Last week I heard about another target for breakage, one that I thought would never see a crack: The natural lands serving as a buffer around Cape Canaveral.
Space X, the aerospace company owned by Elon Musk, wants to make big changes at the Cape. It wants to boost the number of rockets it launches and lands there, as well as boosting the size of the rocket involved.
“SpaceX is seeking [federal] approval for up to 44 Starship-Super Heavy launches per year from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center,” Florida Today reported last month. The proposal has drawn opposition from residents and officials from Titusville, Cape Canaveral, and Brevard County, as well as environmental groups worried about the potential harm to nesting sea turtles, manatees, and endangered right whales.
They’re also concerned about increased pollution, rampant water waste, a huge loss of public access, lots more sonic booms and — not to be rude — the tendency of Space X rockets to blow up. There have been four explosions so far this year.
Katie Bauman via Surfrider International
“Yes, we have seen those headlines,” said Katie Bauman of the Surfrider Foundation, one of the most vocal environmental groups challenging the expansion.
Space X called one of those explosions “a sudden energetic event.” That’s not the kind of energy folks on the Space Coast want to see in their backyard.
But it does give a fresh context to this comment about Space X’s impact on the region by Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Haridopolos: “We are booming, literally, right now.”
The water goes pfft!
“Starship-Super Heavy” sounds like the latest iteration of the “We Built This City” rock group that started as Jefferson Airplane, morphed into Jefferson Starship then became plain Starship.
Instead, it’s actually “the world’s most powerful launch vehicle ever developed,” according to the Space X website. It’s designed to take cargo or astronauts into Earth orbit, to the Moon or even Mars, yet be as reusable as Tupperware.
“Starship and Super Heavy are designed to return to the launch site and be caught following their flight, with the ability to rapidly turn around and launch again,” the company says.
For now, its launch operations have been confined to Texas. Although Musk has had successes, repeated explosions — like the one in March that Reuters reported left “fiery debris streaking through the dusk skies near South Florida” — are something Musk dismissed as “a minor setback.”
During an Aug. 22 Space Coast Symposium speech, SpaceX Vice President of Launch Kiko Dontchev told the crowd, “You’re going to get a vetted machine that shows up ready to party.”
Clearly his definition of “party” is different from mine, and from that of a lot of the people who live and work near the Kennedy Space Center.
“Constituents and businesses have expressed concern over the cumulative environmental effects of high frequency launches, including emissions, chemical runoff, and disturbances to protected coastal and marine habitats,” Brevard County Commissioner Katie Delaney wrote in a letter to federal officials.
The Federal Aviation Administration must decide whether to permit this, which requires an environmental impact statement. In a first draft, FAA officials determined the Starship liftoffs — punctuated by up to 152 sonic booms per year — would generate “few” significant environmental impacts at Launch Complex 37.
That’s not how Bill Fisk sees it.
Bill Fisk via Linkedin
Fisk, a Florida native who grew up watching the Apollo launches with his dad and grandfather, is both the president of the Space Coast Audubon Society and vice chair of the Turtle Coast Sierra Club. For my edification, he catalogued the biggest impacts.
Start with the water, which Bauman of Surfrider brought up as well.
Space X expects to use 400,000 gallons of water per launch and 68,000 gallons per landing, all to cool down hot equipment. That plus other uses for the site put the expected total water use for Space X at 50 million gallons per year.
Yet Brevard is already running low on potable water for residents and businesses, Fisk said.
“It’s getting worse as the developers get more leeway, so the water supply keeps going PFFFT!” he said.
After its use, the remaining Space X fresh water would flow into local waterways that are supposed to be brackish, messing up their salt content. That includes the struggling Indian River Lagoon, where there’s a need to bring back sea grass beds as a nursery for fish and a food source for manatees.
“There is a clear and direct negative impact to the physical environment of the area … by adding excessive amounts of fresh water into the pristine local estuary,” the Southeastern Fisheries Association said in a comment letter to the FAA.
Local fishermen are already complaining about falling space debris damaging their equipment, Fisk said. Crumbling local roads can’t handle the increase in fuel truck traffic, he said. Titusville is bringing in an engineer to examine its public buildings to see if they can handle the increased vibrations.
After all, Fisk said, when the early space program was being built, “everything was built fast and it was built cheap.”
The race to space
The waters off Cape Canaveral saw the last sea battle of the Revolutionary War (we won). That marked the last big news there for a couple of centuries.
But then a Mexican cemetery blew up.
In the 1940s, the American military tested missiles by firing them from New Mexico, but one went off course and blew up a Juarez graveyard. Mexican officials complained, so the military looked for a safer launch site.
They found it at in Florida at what was then known as the Banana River Naval Air Station. The place was isolated, the land already belonged to the government, and the location near the equator meant rockets got an extra boost when they took off.  Everyone seemed happy.
Then, in 1957, Sputnik changed everything.
Suddenly, America was running second to the Soviets and the Space Race was on. Cape Canaveral became the focus of a U.S. space program playing catch-up.
Brevard’s population boomed as engineers, scientists, and construction crews poured into the once-sleepy towns.
“The beach mushroomed and became sheathed in schlock,” author Herb Hiller wrote. ”Everything was built quick and short-term. Motels in Cocoa Beach and Titusville flashed neon rockets and dancing girls. Inside, sequined cuties danced and did more. Motel Row became Sin Strip.”
In the runup to the moon landing, the work force at Canaveral peaked at 26,500 in 1968. But then Space Coast residents found out what any coal miner could’ve told them: It’s no fun living in a company town when the company winds down.
A year after the historic Apollo 11 mission, the work force fell to 15,000. Rocket scientists were pumping gas. Families who couldn’t find a buyer left their keys in the front door of their houses as they left town.
Yet, during the boom and bust, one thing remained constant: the natural buffers around the cape, which preserved the Old Florida feel of a place jumping into the 21st century.
In 1963, the feds created the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, 140,000 acres with more endangered and threatened species than any other refuge in the continental U.S.
Then, a decade later, they set up Canaveral National Seashore — 58,000 acres of barrier island, open lagoon, coastal hammock, pine flatwoods, and offshore waters.
But Space X says every time there’s a takeoff or landing, both must shut down for safety. Even the nude beach.
The naked and the clothed
Florida is the state with the most nudist resorts — 29, compared to 14 for second-place California. Harder to find are Florida’s nude beaches. They exist, but most are not official.
One well-known example is in Canaveral National Seashore: the southern end of Playalinda Beach, accessed from Parking Lot 13.
“Not too many places can you get a full view of a rocket launch while giving a full view,” WKMG-TV noted in a story that reported Playalinda had been named the 20th best nude beach in the world.
One person who submitted a comment against the Space X plan identified himself as a member of the American Association for Nude Recreation. He told the feds, “I do not see the need for corporations to take away our public privileges to public and federal lands.”
Plenty of people who ARE wearing clothes use the rest of Playalinda for swimming, surfing, fishing, picnicking, and camping. After all, it’s the longest stretch of undeveloped Atlantic coastline in Florida.
Both the naked and the clothed are freaking out about the part of the Space X plan that calls for closing access to the beach for at least 60 days a year  — maybe more.
Space program veterans call Musk “the Nibbler,” Fisk told me, because “he’ll say he wants 50 launches — no wait, make it 120 — oh no, we need to do 160 launches.” He keeps nibbling a little more each time.
Residents who love Playalinda don’t want to play Musk’s shutdown game. It’s a public beach that the public wants to use, not hand over to the world’s richest man whenever he wants.
“What we want is a fair middle ground — where launch activity can thrive without compromising the health, safety, and quality of life for our residents,” Commissioner Delaney said on her substack.
I haven’t even mentioned the other Space X threat, one that would affect more than just one region of Florida.
The company wants to launch its Starship-Super Heavy rocket from its existing base in Texas to attain a low-Earth orbit. It would soar over most of North and Central Florida in a way that would block at least 10 and as many as 200 commercial airline flights.
The big break
I was curious about what an actual scientist had to say about all this.
Ken Kremer via X
I got in touch with Ken Kremer, a Ph.D. with 17 patents who’s been writing about the space industry for two decades. He runs the website Space Upclose and boasts that he’s witnessed more than 100 launches.
He agreed with everyone else I talked to about how awful it would be for Space X to close off Playalinda Beach for 60 days minimum.
“That’s really terrible to cut that off for two months,” he said.
But he saw a reasonable alternative.
Apollo 11 rocket launch via Florida State Archives
Space X wants to use Launch Complex 39A. That’s where a lot of American space history happened, including the launch of Apollo 11. An explosion there would wipe out all the historic structures.
Ten miles away is Launch Complex 37. Space X wants to use that one too. Why not require the company to use it exclusively? That way, he said, only minimal beach closures would be required.
“There have to be some reasonable compromises,” Kremer said.
Of course, just changing the launch site doesn’t solve the other problems with pollution, excess water usage, and so forth.
Space Coast residents used to be willing to give the space program the benefit of the doubt because they felt they were doing their patriotic duty. But it’s not like that anymore. Space X is not NASA. It’s just a for-profit business, putting more money into Musk’s already bulging pockets.
I think we should tell Space X that the only way it will be allowed to do everything it wants with Cape Canaveral is if every single launch or landing in Florida carries as a passenger someone named Musk.
It could be Elon. It could be his awful father. It could be one of his 14 kids.
Then, all the water that’s left afterward, they have to drink it. And if they complain about it, tell them, “Hey, those are the breaks.”

The first of its kind report, “State Scorecard on Medicare Performance: How Medicare Is Working for Its Beneficiaries” from the Commonwealth Fund, places Kentucky as the third worst state for Medicare performance. Medicare is mostly for people who are at least 65, though some illnesses and disabilities qualify people for coverage before that age. 
Researchers based their rankings on access to care, quality of care, costs and affordability of care and population health in 2023 and 2024. Mississippi and Louisiana were the only states ranked lower than Kentucky on these measures. The best-performing states were Vermont, Utah and Minnesota. 
Kentuckians covered by Medicare have some of the worst health outcomes and access to care in the country. (Screenshot)
Dr. Joseph Betancourt, the Commonwealth Fund president, said during a Wednesday press call that “Medicare, while a vital safety net for millions of Americans, is not working the same for everyone.” 
“Despite being a national program, the scorecard reveals that where you live often shapes your experience,” Betancourt said. “As a primary care physician, I know how important it is when patients can focus on healing instead of worrying about medical bills. Medicare makes that possible for millions, but we have more work to do to ensure it delivers the care equally and effectively for people in every state.” 
Medicare beneficiaries in southeastern states — including Kentucky — were much more likely than the national average to get prescriptions considered generally “unsafe” for elderly patients, according to David Radley, a senior scientist with the Commonwealth Fund. 
“These are medications that evidence tells us that should be avoided in the elderly when we compare to beneficiaries in other parts of the country,” he said. 
“We also found that the rate of hospitalization from preventable causes, a measure that generally reflects inadequate disease management, is more than double the lowest ranked states compared to the top performing states,” Radley said. The national rate of preventable hospital admissions was 26.4 per 1,000 people in 2023, according to the report. In Kentucky, that was 31.5. 
The Commonwealth Fund’s report found that the rate of preventable hospitalizations is higher in southeastern states, including Kentucky. (Screenshot)
Other takeaways include:

More Kentucky Medicare beneficiaries (66%) than the national average (62%) had three or more chronic conditions in 2023. 
In 2024, nearly 5% of adults in Kentucky older than 65 reported going without needed medical care because of cost. The national average is just under 4%.
More Kentucky adults 65 and older (36%) report feeling lonely than the national average (34%). 
In 2023, the rate per 1,000 Medicare beneficiaries to have a preventable hospitalization was 31.5 in Kentucky and 26.4 nationwide. 

Kristen Kolb, a registered nurse and research associate at the Commonwealth Fund, said those last two points are connected. 
“Research has shown that loneliness is a risk factor for hospital readmissions and is associated with increased health care costs,” she said. “Loneliness or lack of emotional support, is a widespread issue affecting at least 1 in 4 older adults in every state where data was available. Loneliness can have negative health effects and has been linked with poorer health outcomes like increased risk of heart disease and stroke.” 
Betancourt said meaningful social connections and their link to “strong cognitive function” are “critical,” especially for older adults. In 2024 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that loneliness can increase risk of heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, dementia and earlier death. 
More Kentucky adults 65 and older (36%) report feeling lonely than the national average (34%). (Screenshot)
Gretchen Jacobson, the vice president of Medicare, Expanding Coverage and Access at the Commonwealth Fund, said policies at the federal and state levels can help address disparities by setting standards for private plans and incentivizing “providers to apply best practices and reduce wasteful spending and care.” 
“Although Medicare is a national program, health outcomes, access to needed health care, the affordability of care and quality of care all vary widely for the people it covers, and some issues such as loneliness, affect many older adults no matter where they live,” she said. “The combination of state and federal health policy is what enables beneficiaries to get the health care they need, and ultimately affects their health outcomes and experiences with care.”

A shopping plaza being modified to include townhomes or watching your children move away because a home in town is unaffordable?,"With the arrival of Autumn here in Connecticut, many embrace the spooky, Halloween-y spirit. There’s no better place in New England to dance with the macabre than in Salem, Massachusetts, sight of colonial America’s most infamous episode of mass hysteria. 
In 1692 dozens of Salemites were executed for the crime of witchcraft. When one visits the somber memorials and kitschy shops today, it’s easy to indulge in morbid daydreaming. What if witches, the Devil, and all his diabolical servants are real, after all? It can be thrilling to give oneself a good scare.
While it is unclear if supernatural forces remain at work in Salem, the city faces the same mundane challenges of home affordability as anywhere else. Recently, Salem eliminated municipal parking minimums for multifamily housing structures. Instead of requiring builders to set aside a specific number of off-street parking spots for all new construction, the city allows developers to determine the appropriate quantity to provide. Satanic black magic? Nope, just good policy.
Studies have shown time and time again that when cities and towns mandate arbitrary parking minimums for residential and commercial construction, they drive up rents and home-prices, while simultaneously enforcing automobile dependence on residents.
If asked, most Nutmeggers would say that they want to live in a walkable community and that homes are too expensive these days. If you ask them, however, if they support policies that lower housing costs and increase pedestrian accessibility, many recoil in fear.
What’s so scary about housing reform? Many Connecticut residents are terrified of the same kind of common-sense adjustments that Salem’s City Council passed almost unanimously. Connecticut’s HB 5002, the much maligned housing affordability bill debated this summer, included a provision to loosen local parking minimums. While it passed in both houses of the Democratic-led state legislature, Gov. Ned Lamont was pressured to veto the bill after pushback not just from Republicans, but members of his own party.
Why? Many of HB 5002’s opponents were frightened by the bill’s regulatory shifts. I sympathize with these anxieties, but I think the bill’s opponents are worried about the wrong things.
Let’s consider parking minimums. Many who support mandatory off-street parking minimums insist that developers will not build enough parking unless forced, but evidence indicates that this isn’t true. In addition to driving up housing costs, mandatory parking minimums create a paved-over infrastructure that inhibits walkability.
Automobile emissions are a major driver of climate change. When we reduce mandatory parking minimums, we facilitate walkable development. This in turn lowers our carbon footprint.
Opponents of HB 5002 should ask themselves: What is scarier? Climate catastrophe or walking to the grocery store?
Let’s talk about home affordability. Opponents of HB 5002 considered the bill’s provision for by-right multifamily construction in commercial areas to be downright demonic. Local residents, they argue, should be empowered to resist careless developers, who would build structures that increase traffic or mutilate local character. This fear of inappropriate development is understandable, but misplaced.
Excessive public input regarding home permitting leads to fewer homes and higher prices. It may seem democratic to require public approval for housing developments, but public meetings are not necessarily representative of the majority of residents. Ask any town official (off the record) and they will tell you that most public commentary is less a rational analysis of the potential outcomes of a given project, and more an opportunity for cranks to take their social media ramblings to a captive audience.
Opponents of HB 5002 should ask themselves: What is scarier? A shopping plaza being modified to include townhomes without your personal approval, or watching your children move away because a home in town is unaffordable?
Almost all Connecticut Republicans opposed HB 5002. I think this was a poor political strategy, because the party has recently made impressive gains with working-class voters. The GOP should support policies that create an easier path to homeownership for this constituency.
Stranger still was the bill’s Democratic opposition. NIMBYism in blue states has placed the Democratic Party in a precarious electoral position. Liberal strongholds like California, New York and Illinois are hemorrhaging voters to red states, where home construction is able to keep up with demand. If Democrats don’t start building homes in states they control, a presidential candidate in 2032 could win every state that Joe Biden won in 2020, and still lose the electoral college.
Democratic opponents of HB 5002 should ask themselves: what is scarier? A few new apartments in town or a permanently Republican-occupied White House?
‘Tis the season for a good scare, but when Connecticutians reject reasonable changes in the way we plan our communities, we accelerate global warming, increase the cost of housing, and isolate residents from each other. That is one scare I could do without.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Passengers at Alaska’s biggest airports may soon see a political advertisement published by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that blames Democrats for the ongoing federal government shutdown. 
The video, promoted by the White House, features Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and is expected to appear at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints.
Airport officials in other states — including Noem’s home state of South Dakota — have declined to allow the video, citing longstanding policies against airing political content.
In Alaska, the state department of transportation and public facilities owns and operates more than 230 airports statewide, including Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport and Fairbanks International Airport. 
Shannon McCarthy, a spokesperson for the department, said TSA has requested permission to air the ad at both of those airports, but not at others the state operates.
She said those airports “don’t own screens that would be used for this type of content” and that the screens in most parts of the airport are “typically the property of an advertising concessionaire.”
“That said,” McCarthy added, “the Transportation Security Administration does have the ability to display the video within its leased areas at the airport.”
TSA did not respond to an inquiry sent to its listed email address. The phone and email of its listed contact for the region that covers Alaska was disconnected.
Alaska’s Executive Branch Ethics Act prohibits the use of “state funds, facilities, equipment … for partisan political purposes,” but transportation officials said they don’t believe the ethics law applies in this case.
In the 30-second video, Noem acknowledged the federal government shutdown may affect travel, saying “Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government. … We will continue to do all that we can to avoid delays that will impact your travel. And our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.”
Senate Republicans could unilaterally pass budget language funding the government, but doing so would require them to eliminate the filibuster, a rule that requires 60 votes instead of 50 for much of the U.S. Senate’s business.
The Senate has already sidestepped the filibuster with regard to presidential appointments to public office, allowing them to appoint officials without Democratic votes.
Senate Democrats have said they also are willing to offer votes for a shutdown-ending budget deal if Senate Republicans agree to extend subsidies for health care coverage. Thus far, Senate Republicans have declined to do so. 
“TSA operates under a license agreement or what TSA calls an ‘Other Transactions Agreement’ or OTA. … It is silent with respect to displaying videos like the one in question,” McCarthy said.
Only a handful of Alaska’s airports aren’t owned and operated by the state. One notable exception is Juneau International Airport, the state’s third-largest.
There, airport manager Andres Delgado said that he had received an email from a TSA official providing advance notice but hadn’t yet received an official request. 
He said he wanted to check with the city manager and legal counsel before deciding whether to allow the video.
“We’ve been, understandably, trying to avoid taking a stance on it,” he said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/20240218_164207-airport1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-15 23:01:11.653529

U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), who is also seeking the seat and is considered the Democratic establishment’s favorite in the race, did not attend the forum due to a scheduling conflict, her campaign said.
Her absence, however, opened a lane for El-Sayed and McMorrow to shine. Several of the questions dealt with Muslim access to the ballot, what they would do to address the rise of anti-Muslim hate, and musings on free speech in the wake of crackdowns on pro-Palestinian protests.
Here are some of El-Sayed’s and McMorrow’s top responses to questions asked by moderators during the forum. The questions asked by Emgage are in bold and the candidates’ responses follow.
 
Michigan universities have silenced student dissent by branding criticism of Israel as antisemitic. Attorney General Dana Nessel criminally charged university students for expressing their freedom of speech while protesting Israel’s atrocities. Do you believe these charges were appropriate?
El-Sayed: The foundation of our democratic republic is that you have the right to peaceful protest, to freedom of expression. And when that right gets taken away, or when somebody uses the power of the state to oppress somebody for having used that right, something deep and profound is lost. We’ve seen a witch hunt lead from a Democratic attorney general’s office against students for practicing their right to freedom of speech, and I have never faltered when it comes to standing with students against this, frankly, overreach of on the part of a very particular elected official. I’m not afraid to call out my party, rather famously not afraid to call out my party. And I’ve been clear about the fact that, for me, we run on principle, and one of those principles is that any attempt to stifle speech anywhere ends up potentially silencing speech everywhere. It’s the same exact set of policies we’re seeing out of the Trump administration.
McMorrow: The fundamental right to free speech and to protest is exactly that: Fundamental. There is no place where that should be safer than college campuses, places where we send our kids to have difficult conversations and, many times, to be around people who may look different or have different backgrounds from them, maybe for the first time in their entire lives. So I will be a fierce defender of protest, of free speech. I believe that we all bear a responsibility to ensure that that is protected. When it crosses the line into crime, I spoke out when there were a couple of protesters that broke that line and went to the home of Jordan Acker, who’s a University of Michigan regent, defaced his wife’s car and threw jars of urine through the window while his family was home and his daughters were sleeping upstairs. That is where we all need to work together to ensure that free speech is protected.
 
What specific policies would you champion to protect the civil liberties of Arab and Muslim Americans in the face of rising Islamophobia?
El-Sayed: I remember watching as our country ripped itself apart in the post 9/11 era. … I watched as we did things that were in complete opposition to our Constitution, to people who look like us because of our names, because of our faith. First and foremost, we have to stand up to the post 9/11 surveillance state, the network that has wantonly put people who have particular names on no fly lists. I also think about infringements on our freedom of speech. You look at things like Project Ester, you look at bans when it comes to freedom of speech to advocate for the Palestinian cause. And I think in the U.S. Senate, the kind of leadership we need is the kind of leadership that’s both going to take on and dismantle the very illegal system of surveillance and oppression that we’ve seen erected since 9/11 but also its second coming in the form of the assault on basic civil liberties and freedom of speech.
McMorrow: When the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed accusing Dearborn of being a jihadist city, I spoke out, and I spoke out loudly. But it’s not enough just to use your platform. It’s what you do in legislation, as well. We passed and strengthened hate crimes legislation in the state of Michigan, something that I would advocate on the federal level. We live in a moment where social media companies are weaponizing and buying our time and attention, our energy, our names, that it’s all available in public. We need somebody who is willing to stand up to social media companies, to tech companies, to protect our privacy, to protect our data. We passed strong data privacy legislation in the state of Michigan.
 
We’ve already experienced the Muslim-Africa travel ban [in Donald Trump’s first presidential term], and we are seeing the U.S. Department of State targeting the community with visa suspensions. What is your stance on accepting refugees from conflict zones … and how would you address immigration processing under the Trump administration?
El-Sayed: Immigration is good. I should be 100% clear about that. One of the neat tricks that America has had is it’s been able to convince people from all over the world to bring their skills, their resources and their energy and enthusiasm here to build. I know that as a fact because my parents immigrated from another country. I shudder to think about what decision they may have made had they been making that decision in 2025 in Trump’s America, versus in 1978, when my dad immigrated here to go to Wayne State. … [It rests on] the notion that we owe a responsibility to continue to be that kind of country that welcomes people is particularly true when we’re talking about people who come from conflict zones, particularly those who come from conflict zones where our military was involved.
McMorrow: What we are watching is a weaponization of ICE and Immigration Services that actually does nothing to make us safer, and it in fact, makes us less safe. The things that law enforcement agencies need to do their job well is trust within the community. [The federal government’s immigration enforcement] is un-American, and it doesn’t benefit us as Michiganders. Michigan is a state that has attracted people from all around the world who have led us to become one of the most diverse states in the entire country, and that enriches all of our opportunities here in Michigan. I will continue to use my platform as a candidate to pull the wool back on what Kristi Noem and the Trump administration are doing, because it’s not security, it’s security theater.
 
Many Arab and Muslim American voters no longer trust the Democratic Party. How can you rebuild trust and earn their votes without simply echoing their frustrations? 
El-Sayed: I watched, in 2024, as our party sided with a genocidal leader in a country committing a genocide with our tax dollars. And I watched so much of that trust and so much of that work dashed. I don’t know when we stopped being the party of peace, but I’ll tell you this, I remember voting for Barack Obama back in 2008. It was my second presidential election, so excited to vote for him, because he was somebody who’s willing to stand up against a stupid war, the one that we should never have fought. And my question today is, why? How can we not, as a party, recognize that those are our roots, guaranteeing people health care, siding with workers over corporations, making sure that we don’t send our money abroad to drop bombs on other people’s kids, when we could be spending it here on our schools and our health care and our own infrastructure? It’s really not that hard. And I think if we want to win back our community, we have to win back our community on principle, and those are the principles I’m running on.
McMorrow: I’ve even been disappointed by my own party. I wonder what our message is and what we stand for, how are we fighting and how are we standing up for people? I am somebody who came into this work because I believe in the power of community and bringing people together. I also, as the chair of the state Senate Economic and Community Development Committee, believe that the way for us to approach foreign policy is not by leading with the military first, it’s by creating economic opportunity, creating business exchanges, welcoming refugees, welcoming immigrants. … That is something that I have built a track record of. I would love to sit around every table with you, to hear your stories. And we have a lot of work to do to build that trust back. And I’m encouraged to see that we are facing a new generation of leadership across the board, coming into Congress and coming into the Senate, who can hopefully write a new Democratic Party.

,California,2025-10-16 01:31:10+00:00,CalMatters,California hospitals are suing over the state’s efforts to curb their spending,Ana B. Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/10/hospital-spending-cap-lawsuit/,"Hospitals argue that spending caps imposed by an affordability office will result in layoffs, cuts in health care services and reduced access to care for Californians.","In summary
Hospitals argue that spending caps imposed by an affordability office will result in layoffs, cuts in health care services and reduced access to care for Californians.



California hospitals filed a lawsuit against a state health regulator Wednesday, seeking to block rules meant to keep consumer health care costs from growing too quickly. 
The state Office of Health Care Affordability sets limits on health care spending, capping the amount that a hospital’s spending can grow each year. The California Hospital Association argues that the rules are illegal and will result in layoffs and cuts in services, ultimately reducing access to care.
In a complaint filed in San Francisco County Superior Court, the hospital association argues that setting spending limits creates “arbitrary and irresponsible cost targets that single out hospitals.” The suit also contends  that the rules “will severely disrupt … hospitals’ ability to provide comprehensive, high-quality services by starving them of the resources they need to perform their critical roles.” 
A spokesman for the California Health and Human Services Agency, which oversees the affordability office, said the agency does not comment on pending litigation. 
In 2022, state lawmakers created the affordability office with the goal of containing skyrocketing health care costs. More than half of Californians have reported skipping medical care because it costs too much, and 38% report carrying medical debt. In California, health care spending reached $405 billion in 2020 — or $10,299 per person — a 30% increase over five years. 
The office’s appointed board, noting that median household income in California grows an average of 3% annually, set spending targets for hospitals and other providers that aim to match the rise in consumer income. The rules limit spending growth to 3.5% beginning in 2025, and then lower the cap to 3% annually, starting in four years. 
Eight other states have targets similar to California’s rules. In California, hospitals and providers are required to submit spending data to the state to show compliance. Beginning in 2028, the state can enforce spending targets with performance improvement plans and fines. 
The affordability board’s approval of the growth caps was contentious, with one board member saying the target was unrealistic. 
Office’s regulators have since also reduced the limits further for seven hospitals, calling them “high-cost” for consumers. For these facilities, including Stanford Health Care in Palo Alto and Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, regulators set spending growth targets of 1.8% in 2026 and 1.6% in four years. 
“The spending caps set by politically appointed bureaucrats could force cuts that result in many Californians traveling farther for care, facing longer emergency room wait times, experiencing more overcrowding, and losing access to critical services like maternity care, cancer treatment, behavioral health services, and surgical care,” California Hospital Association president and CEO Carmela Coyle said in a statement.
In its suit, the association estimates that the state’s spending target will force 75% of its members to operate at a loss. The policy, the group argues, ignores the rising cost pressures on hospitals, including labor, pharmaceutical prices and a rapidly aging population. In addition, hospitals estimate that a federal spending law will result in billions in losses over the next 10 years, as federal funding and reimbursement for patient care is cut or reduced. 
The statewide target also applies to large doctor groups and health insurers. The California Association of Health Plans, which represents insurers, responded to the hospital association’s lawsuit by saying the state cannot reach its goal of making health care more affordable “unless everyone is part of the solution.” The lawsuit, according to the group, “demonstrates [hospitals’] lack of commitment to the affordability that Californians urgently need.”
Consumer advocates who back the industry spending targets slammed the hospital association’s lawsuit, calling it “outrageous.” 
“For years, health care costs have vastly outpaced inflation and wage growth, with very little to show for it — our higher costs don’t translate to better quality of care, outcomes, equity, or access,” said Amanda McAllister, the executive director of the consumer group Health Access California. That’s why, she said, the state “very thoughtfully” created an affordability office and set rules to control the problem. 
“This lawsuit is a blatant attempt to try to change the rules of the game after the fact because you don’t like the outcome,” she said. Supported by the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF), which works to ensure that people have access to the care they need, when they need it, at a price they can afford.
